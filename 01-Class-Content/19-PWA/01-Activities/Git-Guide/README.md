# Git Hooks

When it comes to Git, development teams can have a number of best practices that they want everyone to follow. This can include how commit messages are styled, what branch names to use, which branches you're allowed to merge into, and so on.

It can be challenging to remember all of these rules, but with **Git hooks**, you can set up automated reminders for yourself. Hooks will listen for certain Git events to occur and then, depending on the event, execute a local script before or after that event.

## Sample Hooks

Git provides a series of sample hooks when you initialize a Git repository. Let's create a new local repository and see what these hooks look like.

From the command line, run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir hook-test
cd hook-test
git init
ls .git/hooks
```

The `.git/hooks` directory contains several files with a `.sample` extension, including the following:

```text
applypatch-msg.sample
commit-msg.sample
fsmonitor-watchman.sample
post-update.sample
pre-applypatch.sample
pre-commit.sample
```

Run the command `code .git/hooks/pre-commit.sample` to open the file in VS Code. Its content will look like the following:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

if git rev-parse --verify HEAD >/dev/null 2>&1
then
	against=HEAD
else
	against=$(git hash-object -t tree /dev/null)
fi

allownonascii=$(git config --type=bool hooks.allownonascii)

exec 1>&2

if [ "$allownonascii" != "true" ] &&
	test $(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=A -z $against |
	  LC_ALL=C tr -d '[ -~]\0' | wc -c) != 0
then
	cat <<\EOF
Error: Attempt to add a non-ASCII file name.

This can cause problems if you want to work with people on other platforms.

To be portable it is advisable to rename the file.

If you know what you are doing you can disable this check using:

  git config hooks.allownonascii true
EOF
	exit 1
fi

exec git diff-index --check --cached $against --
```

Git hooks are written as shell scripts. This particular hook is executed when a commit is about to be made. The logic in this hook will abort the commit if files with non-ASCII names are being committed. For now, however, the hook won't run, due to the `.sample` extension. Let's rename the file to enable the hook.

From the command line, run the following command:

```bash
mv .git/hooks/pre-commit.sample .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

Next, let's create a scenario for this hook to catch. Run the following commands to add, stage, and commit two new files, one of which is going to be invalid:

```bash
touch README.md ðŸ”¨.json
git add .
git commit -m "init"
```

**Note**: You will need to copy and paste the emoji into your command line.

The `pre-commit` hook will catch the emoji in the filename and stop the commit from happening, displaying the following message in the command-line window:

```text
Error: Attempt to add a non-ASCII file name.

This can cause problems if you want to work with people on other platforms.
```

Let's remove the `.json` file and try committing again by using the following commands:

```bash
rm ðŸ”¨.json
git add .
git commit -m "init"
```

This time, the `pre-commit` hook allowed the commit to go through, because the name `README.md` passed the ASCII check. This is a great way to enforce proper filenames in your repository, but every team member would need to enable this hook. Git hooks aren't pushed to the remote; they only reside on your local machine.

## Build Your Own Hook

There are other Git events you can hook into that don't come with a pre-built sample. One of these is the `post-checkout` hook that will run any time you switch branches. A good use case for this hook is to remind yourself to use proper branch naming. For example, your team might have decided to always use `feature/` and `issue/` prefixes for all branch names.

From the command line of your project root, run the following commands to create and open the new hook file:

```bash
touch .git/hooks/post-checkout
chmod +x .git/hooks/post-checkout
code .git/hooks/post-checkout
```

The `chmod` command will update the file permissions so the hook is executable.

In the `post-checkout` file, add the following shell script logic:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

# save list of valid, non issue/feature names
safelist=("main", "develop", "staging")

# get current branch's name
branch=$(git branch --show-current)

# check if not in safelist and doesn't start with issue/feature
if [[ ! ${safelist[*]} =~ "$branch" ]] && [[ ! "$branch" =~ ^(issue/|feature/).* ]]
then
  echo "Warning!"
  echo 'If feature or issue branch, please use "issue/" or "feature/" prefix.'
fi
```

This file will keep a list of valid branch names like `main`, `develop`, etc. and then check if the branch you switched to is not in the `safelist` and doesn't start with `issue/` or `feature/`. We can't prevent checking out the branch with this hook, but we can at least provide a helpful warning that you should use a different branch name.

Save the file and run the following commands, noting which ones trigger the warning and which ones don't:

```bash
git checkout -b develop
git checkout -b my-new-branch
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/homepage
```

Remember, though, that everyone on your team would need to set up this Git hook themselves if this is something you want to enforce.
