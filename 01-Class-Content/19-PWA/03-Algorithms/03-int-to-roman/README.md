# Int To Roman Numeral

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that takes in an integer and returns a string representing the provided number as a Roman Numeral. If you aren't familiar with Roman Numerals or would like to review them, check out <https://reference.yourdictionary.com/resources/romanums.html>.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/int-to-roman.js](Unsolved/int-to-roman.js) in your code editor -- **this is the only file you will modify in this activity.**

  * In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `intToRoman` function to achieve the following:

    * Return a new string representing the provided integer in Roman Numeral form.

    * For example, given the following number:

    ```js
    var num = 5;
    ```

    * The following should be returned:

    ```js
    "V";
    ```

    * Given the following integer:

    ```js
    var num = 9;
    ```

    * The following should be returned:

    ```js
    "IX";
    ```

     * Given the following integer:

     ```js
    var num = 2024;
    ```

    * The following should be returned:

    ```js
    "MMXXIV";

    * Assume the provided number will always be a non-negative integer.

* You can check to see if your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  * Functions that _pass_ the tests will be denoted with a **green check mark**.

  * Functions that _fail_ the tests will be denoted with a **red x and an error message**.

### Hints

* Start by first making sure you understand Roman Numerals and making sure your function works with the most simple inputs.
