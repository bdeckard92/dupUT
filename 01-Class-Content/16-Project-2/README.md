# Module 16: Project 02 Continued

## Overview

Welcome to the second week of Project 02! You'll continue to collaborate with your fellow developers to create a real-world full-stack application that youâ€™ll be able to showcase to potential employers.

At the end of this module, you and your group will present your application to your fellow students in a group presentation. Use the [Project Presentation Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10QaO9KH8HtUXj__81ve0SZcpO5DbMbqqQr4iPpbwKks/edit?usp=sharing) to prepare for the presentation.  Because this is a full-stack web application, you and your fellow developers can concentrate on specific aspects of the project in your presentation, following the principle of the separation of concerns.

But while each individual should be able to speak about their contributions, this is still a group project. Be sure to emphasize how the different parts of your application came together and how you worked as a group!

You'll also update your professional materials, including your portfolio, GitHub profile, resume, and LinkedIn profile. Don't forget to add your new project to the portfolio once you've completed it!

## Key Topics

The following topics will be covered in this module:

* Full-stack applications

* [Git branching workflow](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows)

* [Agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)

* Collaborative development

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-ready if you are able to:

* Speak technically about a feature you implemented in your project

* Explain and execute git branching workflow in a collaborative project

* Resolve merge conflicts

* Explain agile software development

* Design, build and deploy a full-stack web application to Heroku

* Prepare a professional presentation and repository README for your project

## Heads-Up

In the next unit, you'll get to take a deeper dive into JavaScript and learn how it relates to computer science. We are pulling back the curtains to examine some of the more challenging aspects of JavaScript. Get ready to learn all about data structures and closures!
