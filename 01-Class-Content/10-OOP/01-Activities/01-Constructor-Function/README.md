# Constructor Function

In this activity, you will create a constructor function that will take in parameters, which will be passed into the keys as their value. You will also create a key that has a function as its value. 

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/catsDogs.js](Unsolved/catsDogs.js) and create a constructor function called `Animal`

  * The constructor function will take in two parameters, `raining` and `noise`. These will be passed into the keys as their value. 

  * The third key will be a function called `makeNoise()`. The function checks if the `raining` key's value is `true`. If it is, it will log the value of the key's `noise` in the console.
