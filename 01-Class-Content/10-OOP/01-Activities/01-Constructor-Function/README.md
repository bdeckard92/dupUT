# Constructor Function

In this activity, you will create a constructor function. 

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/catsDogs.js](Unsolved/catsDogs.js) and create a constructor function called `Animal`.

  * The constructor function will take in two parameters, `raining` and `noise`. These will be passed into the keys as their value. 

  * Create a third key that will be a function called `makeNoise()`. The function checks if the `raining` key's value is `true`. If it is, it will log the value of the key's `noise` in the console. 

## Bonus

* How can we make the cat make noise? In other words, how can we change the value of `raining` for the `cat` object after it has been created?
