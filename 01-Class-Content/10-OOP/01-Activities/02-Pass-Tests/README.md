# 🏗️ Implement Code to Pass Tests

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to write code that will meet expectations and pass my tests.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It is done when I have written code for a reverse algorithm that takes in a string such as `"Hello World!"` and returns a reversed string such as `"!dlroW olleH"`.

* It is done when I have written code for a palindrome algorithm that uses the `reverse()` method and checks whether the string is a [palindrome](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/palindrome).

* It is done when I have written code for a capitalize algorithm that converts the first letter in each word of a string to an uppercase letter.

* It is done when I can run `npm run test` in the command line and verify that I have correctly implemented each method, and each test passes.

## 💡 Hints

What clues can we glean from `tests/algo.test.js` about how to write the function?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What are ATDD and BDD methods? How are they similar to or different from TDD?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
