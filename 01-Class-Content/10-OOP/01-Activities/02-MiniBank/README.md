# MiniBank

In this activity you will use objects to create a mini banking application.

## Instructions

### Part 1 - Add methods and properties to `MiniBank`

Update the `MiniBank` constructor function with methods and properties as follows:

1. Define a property named `statement`. Assign an initial value of an array containing the `balance` parameter passed to the constructor.

2. Add a `setBalance` function. This function should receive a `value` parameter and assign it to the `balance` property of `MiniBank`.

3. Write an `updateStatement` function that takes in a number and pushes it to the `statement` array.

4. Write a `getStatement` function that returns the `statement` property.

5. Write a `printStatement` function that prints each element in the `statement` array on its own line.

6. Write a `deposit` function that takes a value and performs the following:

   - Calls `updateStatement` to record the deposit transaction.
   - Calls `setBalance` to update the `balance` property.

7. Write a `withdraw` function that takes a value and performs the following:

   - Calls `updateStatement` to record the withdrawal transaction. (Be sure to use a negative number here.)
   - Calls `setBalance` to update the `balance` property.

### Part 2 - Create and use a `MiniBank` instance

1. Create a new `bank` object using the `MiniBank` constructor function.

2. Print the `bank` balance.

3. Deposit some money into the `bank` object.

4. Print the `bank` balance.

5. Withdraw some money from the `bank` object.

6. Print the `bank` balance.

## Bonus üèÜ

- Add code to throw an error if the user tries to withdraw more money than they have, or try to deposit or withdraw values that aren't positive numbers.

- Add code to return a copy of the `statement` array when `getStatement` is called, rather than returning the original array.
