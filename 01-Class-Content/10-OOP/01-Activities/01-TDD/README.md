# 📖 Write Tests for Algorithms

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to create tests to define the expectations for algorithms.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It is done when the `reverse()` test is written to expect the string `"Hello World!"` to become `"!dlroW olleH"` after calling `new Algo().reverse()`.

* It is done when the `isPalindrome()` test is written to expect the string `"racecar"` to return `true` and the string `"neon"` to return `false` after calling `new Algo().isPalindrome()`.

* It is done when the `capitalize()` test is written to expect the string `"capitalize the first letter of each word in a string."` to become `"Capitalize The First Letter Of Each Word In A String."` after calling `new Algo().capitalize()`.

## 📝 Notes

For this activity, no code has been added to the `algo.js` test. As a result, all of the tests will fail. This is the expected behavior. Later, we will build on these skills to write tests that define the expectations of actual code.

Refer to the documentation:

[Jest API documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/api)

## 💡 Hints

How can we use the `describe()`, `it()`, and `expect()` functions in Jest to check for the expected behavior?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* Where can you find examples of well-written tests?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
