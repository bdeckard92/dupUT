# Is Unique

In this activity, you will write code to create a function that takes an array of numbers. Return `true` if no number appears more than once in the given array, else return `false`.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/is-unique.js](Unsolved/is-unique.js) in your code editor; **this is the only file that you will modify in this activity.**

  * In this file, you will write code in the body of the `isUnique` function to achieve the following:

    * Return `true` if no number appears more than once in the given array, else return `false`.

    * For example, given the following array:

      ```js
      var arr = [3, 4, 5, 7, 9]; // no number is repeated
      ```

    * The following should be returned:

      ```js
      true
      ```

    * Given the following array:

      ```js
      var arr = [20, -20, 18, 2, 3, 20]; // 20 appears twice
      ```

    * The following should be returned:

      ```js
      false
      ```

* You can check to see if your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  * Functions that pass the tests will be denoted with a green check mark.

  * Functions that fail the tests will be denoted with a red x and an error message.

### Hints

* There are a variety of ways to solve this problem, but try to use the same technique that you used in the previous `character-count` problem.
