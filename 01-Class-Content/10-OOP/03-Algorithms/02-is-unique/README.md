# Is Unique

In this activity, you will write code to create a function that takes an array of numbers and returns `true` if no number appears more than once in the given array; else, it returns `false`.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/is-unique.js](Unsolved/is-unique.js) in your code editor; this is the only file that you will modify in this activity.

* In this file, you will write code in the body of the `isUnique()` function to achieve the following:

  * Return `true` if no number appears more than once in the given array; else, return `false`.

  * See the following array for an exampl:

    ```js
    var arr = [3, 4, 5, 7, 9]; // no number is repeated
    ```

  * Given the preceding array, the following should be returned:

    ```js
    true
    ```

  * See the following array for an example:

    ```js
    var arr = [20, -20, 18, 2, 3, 20]; // 20 appears twice
    ```

  * Given the preceding array, the following should be returned:

    ```js
    false
    ```

* You can check whether your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  * Functions that pass the tests will be denoted with a green check mark.

  * Functions that fail the tests will be denoted with a red X and an error message.

### Hints

There are a variety of ways to solve this problem, but try the same technique that you used in the Character Count algorithm from a previous unit.
