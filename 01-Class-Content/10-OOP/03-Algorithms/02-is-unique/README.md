# Is Unique

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that takes an array of numbers. Return `true` if no number appears more than once in the given array, else return `false`.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/is-unique.js](Unsolved/is-unique.js) in your code editor -- **this is the only file you will modify in this activity.**

  * In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `isUnique` function to achieve the following:

    * Return `true` if no number appears more than once in the given array, else return `false`.

    * For example, given the following array:

    ```js
    var arr = [3, 4, 5, 7, 9]; // no number is repeated
    ```

    * The following should be returned:

    ```js
    true
    ```

    * Given the following array:

    ```js
    var arr = [20, -20, 18, 2, 3, 20]; // 20 appears twice
    ```

    * The following should be returned:

    ```js
    false
    ```

* You can check to see if your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  * Functions that _pass_ the tests will be denoted with a **green check mark**.

  * Functions that _fail_ the tests will be denoted with a **red x and an error message**.

### Hints

* There are a variety of different ways to solve this problem, but attempt to use the same technique used in the earlier `character-count` problem.
