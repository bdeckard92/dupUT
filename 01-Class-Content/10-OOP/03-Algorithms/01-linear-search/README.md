# Linear Search

In this activity, you will write code to create a function that takes an array of numbers and a target number and returns the index of the target number in the given array.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/linear-search.js](Unsolved/linear-search.js) in your code editor; this is the only file that you will modify in this activity.

  * In this file, you will write code in the body of the `linearSearch()` function to achieve the following:

    * Return the index of the given `target` number in the given `arr` array.

    * If the `target` number is not present in the given `arr` array, return `-1`.

    * See the following array and target number for an example:

      ```js
      var arr = [82, 22, -4, 21, 1, 8];
      var target = 8;
      ```

    * Given the preceding array and target number, the following number should be returned:

      ```js
      5
      ```

    * If the array contains multiple instances of the target number, return the index for the first instance.

    * **Important:** You may not use the built-in `indexOf()`, `lastIndexOf()`, or `includes()` methods for this problem.

* You can check whether your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  * Functions that pass the tests will be denoted with a green check mark.

  * Functions that fail the tests will be denoted with a red X and an error message.
