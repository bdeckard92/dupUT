# Linear Search

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that takes an array of numbers and a target number and returns the index of the target number in the given array.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/linear-search.js](Unsolved/linear-search.js) in your code editor -- **this is the only file you will modify in this activity.**

  * In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `linearSearch` function to achieve the following:

    * Return the index of the given `target` number in the given `arr` array.

    * If the `target` number is not present in the given `arr` array, return -1.

    * For example, given the following array and target number:

    ```js
    var arr = [82, 22, -4, 21, 1, 8];
    var target = 8;
    ```

    * The following number should be returned:

    ```js
    5
    ```

    * If the array contains multiple instances of the target number, return the index for the first instance.

    * **You may not use the built-in `indexOf`, `lastIndexOf`, or `includes` methods for this problem.**

* You can check to see if your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  * Functions that _pass_ the tests will be denoted with a **green check mark**.

  * Functions that _fail_ the tests will be denoted with a **red x and an error message**.
