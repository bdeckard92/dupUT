# Is Anagram

In this activity, you will write code to create a function that takes in two strings and returns `true` if one string is an anagram of another string and otherwise returns `false`.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/is-anagram.js](Unsolved/is-anagram.js) in your code editor; this is the only file that you will modify in this activity.

* In this file, you will write code in the body of the `isAnagram()` function to achieve the following:

  * Return `true` if one string is an anagram of the other string. Otherwise return `false`.

    > **Note:** An **anagram** is a word or phrase made by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase. See the [Wikipedia page on anagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram) for more information.

  * You can check whether the strings are anagrams of each other by checking whether any permutation of (combination of letters in) the first string is equal to the second string.

  * For example, see the following strings:

    ```js
    var strA = "nnjjdyus";
    var strB = "njdnsjyu";
    ```

  * Given the preceding strings, the following should be returned:

    ```js
    true
    ```

  * See the following strings for an example:

    ```js
    var strA = "tacocat";
    var strB = "ctatocato";
    ```

  * Given the preceding strings, the following should be returned:

    ```js
    false
    ```

  * You can assume that the string will contain all lowercase letters.

* You can check whether your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  * Functions that pass the tests will be denoted with a green check mark.

  * Functions that fail the tests will be denoted with a red X and an error message.

### Hints

You can approach this problem by trying to find out if both strings are the same length and contain the same letters.
