# Merge Sorted

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that takes in two sorted arrays of numbers and merges the contents of both arrays into one new sorted array.

**Note**: You may not use the built-in sort method for this activity.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/merge-sorted.js](Unsolved/merge-sorted.js) in your code editor -- this is the only file you will modify in this activity.

  * In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `mergeSorted()` function to achieve the following:

    * Return a new sorted array containing the contents of `arr1` and `arr2`.

    * See the following array for an example:

      ```js
      var arr1 = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42];
      var arr2 = [1, 2, 3, 6, 20, 21];
      ```

    * Given the preceding arrays, the following should be returned:

      ```js
      [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 15, 16, 20, 21, 23, 42];
      ```

    * See the following array for an example:

      ```js
      var arr1 = [13, 15, 31, 99];
      var arr2 = [100];
      ```

    * Given the preceding arrays, the following should be returned:

      ```js
      [13, 15, 31, 99, 100];
      ```

    * **Reminder**: You may not use the built-in sort method for this activity.

* You can check whether your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  * Functions that pass the tests will be denoted with a green check mark.

  * Functions that fail the tests will be denoted with a red X and an error message.
