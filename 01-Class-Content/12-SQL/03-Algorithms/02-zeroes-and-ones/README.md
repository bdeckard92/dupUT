# Zeroes and Ones

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that takes in a string containing only 0s and 1s, and returning true if there are an equal number of 0s and 1s, else returning false.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/zeroes-and-ones.js](Unsolved/zeroes-and-ones.js) in your code editor -- **this is the only file you will modify in this activity.**

  * In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `zeroesAndOnes` function to achieve the following:

    * Return true if there are an equal number of 0s and 1s in the given string.

    * For example, given the following string:

    ```js
    var str = "00110011"; // 4 0s, 4 1s
    ```

    * The following should be returned:

    ```js
    true
    ```

    * Given the following string:

    ```js
    var str = "11110"; // 4 1s, 1 0
    ```

    * The following should be returned:

    ```js
    false
    ```

* You can check to see if your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  * Functions that _pass_ the tests will be denoted with a **green check mark**.

  * Functions that _fail_ the tests will be denoted with a **red x and an error message**.
