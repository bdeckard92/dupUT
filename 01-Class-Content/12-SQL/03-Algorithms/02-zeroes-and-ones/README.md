# Zeroes and Ones

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that takes in a string containing only `0` and `1` values and returns `true` if there are an equal number of `0` and `1` values; else returns false.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/zeroes-and-ones.js](Unsolved/zeroes-and-ones.js) in your code editor -- this is the only file you will modify in this activity.

  * In this file, you will be writing code in the body of the `zeroesAndOnes()` function to achieve the following:

    * Returns `true` if there are an equal number of `0` and `1` values; else return false.

    * Refer to the following string for an example:

      ```js
      var str = "00110011"; // 4 0s, 4 1s
      ```

    * Given the preceding string, the following should be returned:

      ```js
      true
      ```

    * Refer to the following array for another example:

      ```js
      var str = "11110"; // 4 1s, 1 0
      ```

    * Given the preceding string, the following should be returned:

      ```js
      false
      ```

* You can check whether your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  * Functions that pass the tests will be denoted with a green check mark.

  * Functions that fail the tests will be denoted with a red X and an error message.
