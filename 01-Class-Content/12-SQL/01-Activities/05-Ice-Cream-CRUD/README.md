In this activity, you will write functions that will query the database to perform CRUD operations. 

## Instructions

* Open the [Unsolved/server.js](Unsolved/server.js) file.

* Update the `user` and `password` with your MySQL username and password.

* Examine the `createProduct()` function and use as a reference to write the following functions to UPDATE, DELETE, and READ data in the `iceCreamDB` database. 

  * Update the quantity for `Rocky Road` to 100

  * Delete the flavor `strawberry`

  * Read all of the data from the `products` table

  * Remember to include the callback functions!

* To check if everything was done correctly, run `npm install` and `npm start` in the command line. 

## Hint(s)
