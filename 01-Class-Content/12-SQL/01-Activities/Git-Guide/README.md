# Git Cherry-Pick

Sometimes you will work on code that has already been fixed or completed in another commit, by another developer. If that code hasn't been merged yet, how can you get those changes into your own branch?

`git cherry-pick` allows us to pull one or multiple commits into a branch. Let's consider an example of when this might be useful!

**Note**: For more information, refer to the [Git documentation on git cherry-pick](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick).

## Create an Example Repo

1. Inside this directory or another directory of your choosing, create a new folder called `git-cherry-pick`. Change into that directory and initialize it as a Git repository, as follows:

    ```sh
    mkdir git-cherry-pick
    cd git-cherry-pick
    git init
    ```

2. Now we will create `app.js`, `index.html`, and `README.md` files and add them to the repo. After that, we will commit everything as the initial commit -- like in the following example:

    ```sh
    touch app.js index.html README.md
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

3. Create a new branch, as a stand-in for a branch that a coworker or teammate might have made. We'll name this branch as if the teammate is working on a new feature, as shown in the following example:

    ```
    git checkout -b feature/notifications
    ```

4. Now that the coworker has a branch of their own, let's add some code to make the app functional. Inside `index.html`, copy and paste the following snippet and save the `index.html`:

    ```html
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <title>Git Cherry-Pick!</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <script src="app.js"></script>
        <code>Git Cherry-Pick üçí</code>
      </body>
    </html>
    ```

    Make sure to link the `app.js` file inside of the HTML file as well.

5. Inside the `app.js` file, let's add some changes to turn the alert into something a little more complex. . Whenever the `index.html` page is visited, we should be greeted with a random message in an alert window. To achieve that, copy and paste the following code into the `app.js` file:

    ```js
    const randomMessage = (notifications) =>
      notifications[Math.floor(Math.random() * notifications.length)];

    const notifications = [
      {
        person: 'Mac',
        message: 'Hello! This is git-cherry-pick!',
      },
      {
        person: 'Deandre',
        message: 'Hello, I hope to be a comedian one day',
      },
      {
        person: 'Charlie',
        message: 'Hello, I am the king of the rats',
      },
    ];

    const { person, message } = randomMessage(notifications);
    alert(`${person} says: ${message}`);
    ```

6. Imagine that the coworker or teammate makes a commit at this point, as follows:

    ```sh
    git add .
    git commit -m "Adds random message feature"
    ```

7. Then let's say that the coworker decides to scrap that feature entirely and change it to a simple "Hello, world" message instead. Let's make a commit that would emulate that change. Highlight everything inside `app.js` and replace it with `console.log('hello world')`.

8. Make the following commit for this change, as if you were the coworker:

    ```sh
    git add .
    git commit -m "Remove random message feature"
    ```

9. Let's note the commit that added the feature so that we can reference it later. To do this, run the following command:

    ```sh
    git log
    ```

10. The `log` command will return a list of recent commits. Highlight the hash for the commit where the feature was added, as shown in the following image, and paste it somewhere for later:

    ![In the Git log results, an arrow points at the hash for the commit that added the feature.](./Images/01-log.png)

11. To exit the Git log, enter `q` in the terminal.

That's it! We've created a repository and a feature branch that simulates one created by a teammate. We added a feature to `app.js` and committed that change to the `feature/notifications` branch, then later removed that feature and committed to `feature/notifications`.

Now imagine that you want to use that feature in your own branch, without bringing in all the changes from the `feature/notifications` branch. Now you get to use the `git cherry-pick` command!

## Use git cherry-pick

Time to bring in a specific commit to your own feature branch!

1. While you are checked out to `feature/notifications`, create a new branch called `feature/mybranch`, as follows:

    ```sh
    git checkout main
    git checkout -b feature/mybranch
    ```

2. Now let's cherry-pick the commit from the `feature/notifications` branch and pull it into this branch. To do so, we'll finally use the `git cherry-pick` command, as shown in the following snippet:

    ```sh
    git cherry-pick <hash>
    ```
  
    **Note**: You can paste the whole hash string or provide just the first seven characters (for example, `42e6ce587933317cc3b9c4f465bc620547d65a32` or `42e6ce5`).

Nice work! If you run `git --log` again, you will note that the commit has been applied to the `feature/mybranch` branch with a new hash.

You might want to stage the changes and not commit right away -- for example, you might choose to edit something before committing the cherry-pick. You can do that by using the `-n` flag, as follows:

```sh
git cherry-pick f18756a -n
```

## Conclusion

Today we created a small repo and simulated collaboration with a coworker or teammate. We used `git cherry-pick` to bring a single commit into a branch without needing to pull in everything. This feature is just one more useful tool to add to your Git toolbox!
