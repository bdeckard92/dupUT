# üêõ Query Not Deleting Row from Table

Resolve the following issue(s):

* As a developer, I want to be able to delete a specific row from the `books` table.

## Expected Behavior

When I run `server.js`, the row with the `id` of `2` should be deleted from the table and the updated table displayed in the console.

## Actual Behavior

When I run `server.js`, an `ER_PARSE_ERROR` results and the table is not updated.

## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

1. In the MySQL Shell, execute the `db/schema.sql` file.

2. Next, execute the `db/seeds.sql` file.

3. Run `node server.js` to start the Express.js server. The results of the query and the table are shown in the console.
