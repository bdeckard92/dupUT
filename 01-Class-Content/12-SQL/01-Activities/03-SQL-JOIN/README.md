# SQL JOIN

In this activity, you will join the `books` and `authors` data together using JOIN queries.

## Instructions 

* In the [Unsolved](Unsolved/) folder, create a `join.sql` file and write JOIN queries for the following: 

    * show ALL books with authors

    * show ALL books, even if we don't know the author

    * show ALL authors, even if we don't know the book

* To initiate the MySQL command line, type: `mysql -u root -p` in your command line and then your MySQL password. Be sure your MySQL Server is running!

* To set up the database, type into the MySQL command line: `source schema.sql`

* To seed the database, type into the MySQL command line: `source seeds.sql`

* To check if everything was done correctly, type into the MySQL command line: `source join.sql`

* To exit the MySQL command line, type `quit;` or `exit;`

## Hint(s)

* Think of when you would use `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN` queries.
