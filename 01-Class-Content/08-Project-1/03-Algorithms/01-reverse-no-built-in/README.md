# Reverse Words

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that takes a string and returns a new string with all of the characters in reverse order. You are not allowed to use the built-in `reverse` method.

## Instructions

- Open [Unsolved/reverse-no-built-in.js](Unsolved/reverse-no-built-in.js) in your code editor -- **this is the only file you will modify in this activity.**

  - In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `reverse` function to achieve the following:

    - Return a new string that has all the characters in the given string in reversed order.

    - e.g. given the following string:

    ```js
    var str = "just keep swimming";
    ```

    - The following string should be returned:

    ```js
    "gnimmiws peek tsuj";
    ```

- You can check to see if your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  - Functions that _pass_ the tests will be denoted with a **green check mark**.

  - Functions that _fail_ the tests will be denoted with a **red x and an error message**.
