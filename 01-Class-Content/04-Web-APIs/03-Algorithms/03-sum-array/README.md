# Sum Array

In this activity, you will write code to create a function that adds up all the numbers in a given array and returns the total.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/sum-array.js](./Unsolved/sum-array.js) in your code editor -- this is the only file you will modify in this activity.

* In this file, you will write code in the body of the `sumArray` function to achieve the following:

  * Add all of the numbers in the given `arr` array argument and return the total.

    * For example, given the following array:

    ```js
    var arr = [3, 1, 5, 6];
    ```

    * The following number should be returned:

    ```js
    15;
    ```

* You can check to see if your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](./Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  * Functions that pass the tests will be denoted with a green check mark.

  * Functions that fail the tests will be denoted with a red x and an error message.
