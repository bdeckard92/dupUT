# Log Even Nums

In this activity, you will write code to create a function that prints even numbers from 0 to a given number.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/log-even-nums.js](./Unsolved/log-even-nums.js) in your code editor -- this is the only file you will modify in this activity.

* In this file, you will write code in the body of the `logEvenNums` function to achieve the following:

  * Print all even numbers from `0` up to the given `nums` argument inclusive.

    * For example, given the number `6` as the `num` argument, the following should be printed to the console, one log at a time:

      ```bash
      0
      2
      4
      6
      ```

* You can check to see if your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](./Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  * Functions that pass the tests will be denoted with a green check mark.

  * Functions that fail the tests will be denoted with a red x and an error message.
