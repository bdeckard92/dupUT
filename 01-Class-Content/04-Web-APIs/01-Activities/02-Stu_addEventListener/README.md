# addEventListener On Click

In this activity, we are going to create a button that increments a counter when clicked.

## Instructions

* In a file called `index.html`, create a button containing the string "Increment".

* In a file called `script.js`, create an event listener with a callback that increments the counter and displays the updated count on the webpage.

* Add a button that decrements the counter when clicked.

## Bonus

* Add some code to ensure that the count never gets below 0.
