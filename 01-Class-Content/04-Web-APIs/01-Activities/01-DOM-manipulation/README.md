# DOM manipulation

In this activity, you are going to use DOM methods to create an entire webpage.

## Instructions

* Open [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) in your browser and monitor it as you work on this activity.

* Open [script.js](Unsolved/assets/js/script.js) in your IDE and only work in this file!

* Using only DOM methods, create an entire HTML page. It should include:

  * A centered h1 with the title of the webpage
  
  * A centered h2 under it with a short description of the webpage.

  * A centered image with a centered caption under it.

  * A list of your favorite foods (or some other list of favorites).

* If you have some time left, add some extra styling to the elements.

## Hints

* Which DOM methods allow you to create an HTML element, add an HTML element, and add a specified attribute to an HTML element?

* Which property allows you to set the text content of the specified node?
