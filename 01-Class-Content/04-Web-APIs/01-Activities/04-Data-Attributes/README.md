# 🏗️ Use Data Attributes to Display Hidden Number

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a player, I want to click on a card and view the hidden number.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It is done when I click on a card and the hidden number is revealed.

* It is done when the number is visible if the card is clicked.

## Assets

The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

## 💡 Hints

How can we use the `dataset` object to access an element's data attributes?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* We have learned `getAttribute()` and `setAttribute()`. What other methods can you use to access an element's attributes?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
