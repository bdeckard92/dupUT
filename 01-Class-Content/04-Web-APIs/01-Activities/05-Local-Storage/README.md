# 🐛 Save Object Using localStorage

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to save the information from a form as an object using `localStorage`.

## Expected Behavior

* When a user clicks the Sign Up button the form's current values are stored in a object as a string using `localStorage`.

## Actual Behavior

When a user clicks the Sign Up button the form's current values are not stored in `localStorage`.

## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.

2. Enter data in the form field and click the Save button.

3. Navigate to Google Dev Tool's Application tab to view the data saved as a string in `localStorage`.
