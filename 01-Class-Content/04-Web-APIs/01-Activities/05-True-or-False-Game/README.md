# True or False Game

In this activity, you will create a "True or False" game that will ask five questions and return the final score.

## Instructions

* Open [script.js](Unsolved/assets/js/script.js) and implement the following:

  * Create an array with five question objects. Each object in the array should be structured as follows: 

  `{ q: "QUESTION", a: "ANSWER" }`

  * Create a variable to keep track of the score.

  * Write code that will ask the user the questions, one by one, in a confirmation box. The user must answer by selecting OK (for true) or Cancel (for false).

  * Check the user's answer against the correct answer and provide them with an alert telling them if they are right or wrong.

  * Increment the score if the answer is correct.

  * At the end of the game, show an alert that displays the final score.

## Hint(s)

* What can we use to iterate over an array of questions in order to display them one by one?

* Which DOM method can we use to display a confirmation? 

* Which DOM method can we use to display an alert?
