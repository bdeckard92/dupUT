# Rock-Paper-Scissors

In this activity, you will use functions to create a simple Rock Paper Scissors game.

## Instructions

* Open [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) in your IDE and create a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game in which one player plays against a computer opponent. 

  * Create an array of the three game choices: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

  * Create variables to hold the number of wins, losses, and ties. They start at 0.

  * Using `Math.floor()` and `Math.random()`, randomly choose one of the three game choices as the computer's turn.

  * Using `prompt()`, collect the user's response and convert it to lower case as the user's turn.

  * Using `if/else` statements, create the game logic to run if the user chooses a valid game option. 

  * Using `alert()`, let the user know the result of each round as well as the final total.

### Rules for Rock-Paper-Scissors

* Rock: wins against scissors, loses to paper, and ties against itself.

* Paper: wins against rock, loses to scissors, and ties against itself.

* Scissors: wins against paper, loses to rock, and ties against itself.
