# Functions

In this activity, you will write functions to do simple math and check the arguments passed in. Then you will log the results in the browser console.

## Instructions

* Open [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) in your IDE and add JavaScript code for the following:

  * Create a function, `adder()`, that accepts three arguments and returns their sum.

  * Create a function, `muliplier()`, that accepts three arguments and returns their product. 

  * Create a function, `isString()`, that accepts three arguments and checks if the type of all three is a string.

    * If they are strings, return a message confirming they are strings.

    * If they are not strings, return a message saying they are not strings.

  * Create a function, `vowelChecker()`, that accepts one argument, a string, and checks if the first letter of the string is a vowel. 

    * If it is a vowel, return a message confirming it is a vowel.

    * If it is not a vowel, return a message saying it is not a vowel.

* Check the browser console to see if the functions are working correctly and the messages are being logged successfully.

## Hint(s) 

* How do you check the _type of_ a value?

* How do you check the _character at_ a given position in a string?
