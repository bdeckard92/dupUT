# Iteration Random

In this activity, you will use a `for` loop and `Math.random()` to log random numbers in the browser console.

## Instructions

* Open [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) in your IDE and add JavaScript code to generate a random number between 1 and 10 and log it in the console.

  * Use a `for` loop to log 10 numbers in the console.

  * Use `Math.random()` to generate a random number.

## Hint(s)

`Math.random()` returns a decimal (or _floating point_) number. How will you convert it to a whole number?
