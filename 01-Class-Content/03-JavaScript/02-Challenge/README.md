# 03 JavaScript Assignment: Password Generator

## Description

Create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code.

If you are unfamiliar with special characters, take a look at some ([examples](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters))

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I a new, secure password
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
THEN a password is generated
```




 

The application should validate user input and ensure that at least one character type is selected.

Once all prompts are answered, the user will be presented with a password matching the answered prompts. Displaying the generated password in an alert is acceptable, but attempt to write the password to the page instead.

Your application should have a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

As a bonus, the user should also have the option to click a button to copy the password to their clipboard.
