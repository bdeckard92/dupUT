# Odd or Even

In this activity, you will write code to create a function that determines whether a number is odd or even.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/odd-or-even.js](Unsolved/odd-or-even.js) in your code editor; this is the only file you will modify in this activity.

  * In this file, you will write code in the body of the `oddOrEven` function to achieve the following:

    * If `num` is evenly divisible by 2, return the string `"even"`.

    * If `num` is not evenly divisible by 2, return the string `"odd"`.

* You can check whether your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  * Functions that pass the tests will be denoted with a green check mark.

  * Functions that fail the tests will be denoted with a red x and an error message.
