# Log Nums

In this activity, you will write code to create a function that prints all whole numbers from 1 to a given number.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/log-nums.js](Unsolved/log-nums.js) in your code editor; this is the only file you will modify in this activity.

  * In this file, you will write code in the body of the `logNums` function to achieve the following:

    * Print all numbers from `1` up to the given `nums` argument inclusive. For example, given the number `5` as the `num` argument, the following should be printed to the console, one log at a time:

      ```bash
      1
      2
      3
      4
      5
      ```

* You can check whether your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  * Functions that pass the tests will be denoted with a green check mark.

  * Functions that fail the tests will be denoted with a red X and an error message.
