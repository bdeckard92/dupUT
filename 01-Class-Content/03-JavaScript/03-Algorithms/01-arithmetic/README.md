# Arithmetic

In this activity, you will write code to create functions capable of different arithmetic operations.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/arithmetic.js](Unsolved/arithmetic.js) in your code editor; this is the only file you will modify in this activity.

  * In this file, you will write code in the body of each function defined to accomplish the following:

    * `add` returns the result of `num1` plus `num2`.

    * `subtract` returns the result of `num1` minus `num2`.

    * `multiply` returns the result of `num1` times `num2`.

    * `divide` returns the result of `num1` divided by `num2`.

* At each step, you should check to see if your functions work properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  * Functions that pass the tests will be denoted with a green check mark.

  * Functions that fail the tests will be denoted with a red x and an error message.

### Hints

* Remember to `return` a value from each function.
