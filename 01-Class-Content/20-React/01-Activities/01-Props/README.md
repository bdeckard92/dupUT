# üèóÔ∏è Pass Data Using Props

## Before We Begin

Before you begin this activity, complete the following steps:

1. Delete the `/src` folder in [00-practice-app](../00-practice-app/).

2. Copy the `/src` folder from [Unsolved](./Unsolved/) and paste it into [00-practice-app](../00-practice-app/).

3. This project uses Bootstrap, so don't forget to install bootstrap using the command `npm install bootstrap` and import it inside `index.js`:

   `import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'`

## Activity

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to render a card by passing props.

## Acceptance Criteria

The activity is done when it meets the following criteria:

* It is done when I have updated the return method in `src/components/Display.js` to render a card.

* It is done when I have passed data for the dog's `name`, `description`, and `id` as props to the `Card` component.

* It is done when I have modified to `Card` component to render the `canine` properties.

## üí° Hints

* How can we use the [React docs on components and props](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/components-and-props.html) to understand props better?

* What is the term **props** short for?

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How could we use the [style tag](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/dom-elements.html#style) to add additional style to our React components?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
