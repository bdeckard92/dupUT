# 🏗️ Implement Functionality for the Forms Section

## Before We Begin

Before you begin this activity, complete the following steps:

1. Delete the `/src` folder in [00-practice-app](../00-practice-app/).

2. Copy the `/src` folder from [Unsolved](./Unsolved/) and paste it into [00-practice-app](../00-practice-app/).

## Activity

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to prevent empty input for the email and username fields of a form.
  
* As a developer, I want to improve the user experience by automatically clearing the input fields after the user clicks submit.

* As a developer, I want to make the application more robust by adding a password input field.

* As a developer, I want to ensure that the email and password provided by the user are valid.

## Acceptance Criteria

This activity is complete when the following criteria are met:

* It's done when I have created a state variable, `password`.

* It's done when I have added a condition to check if the input type is `password` and to update state using `setPassword`.

* It's done when I have used the methods in the `helper.js` file to validate the format of the email and the strength of the password.

* It's done when I have set the input fields back to empty strings after the user clicks submit.

* It's done when I have added a new input field in the return statement with `name`, `type`, `placeholder`, `value`, and `onChange` attributes.

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How could we have implemented basic form validation without using helper functions?
