# useEffect Thermostat

In this activity, you will use the `useEffect` Hook to update the browser tab to reflect the current temperature.

## Instructions

* **Note** You will be using the same React application, [reactpractice](../reactpractice), for all of our activities today.

* Copy the [Unsolved/src](Unsolved/src) folder and paste it into the React application. 

* Navigate to [01-Activities/reactpractice](../reactpractice) and start the app in dev mode by running `npm start` from your command line.

* Check out the application running on <http://localhost:3000> in your browser. 

* In [Thermostat.js](../reactpractice/src/components/Thermostat.js), implement the following:

  * Import `useEffect` Hook from React.

  * Set the `temp` variable to any starting temperature of your choice.

  * Use the `useEffect` Hook to set the `document.title` to the current temperature.

* Check the application in your browser to see if the thermostat works properly.

* Press `CTRL + C` to stop the server before moving on to the next activity.

## Hint(s)

* You can refer to the React Docs on [Using the Effect Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html).
