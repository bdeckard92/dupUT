# Before We Begin

Initializing a React application by using the `create-react-app` command-line utility can take some time. To save time throughout this unit, we will create one React application and only replace the `/src` files for each subsequent activity as we work on them. Before you add comments to the code, you will practice the workflow for creating a React app and updating your practice app for subsequent activities.

To do this, follow these steps:

1. In the command line, navigate to `20-React/01-Activities`.

2. Run the command `npx create-react-app 00-practice-app`.

3. After `create-react-app` has completed (which can take a few minutes), run the command `npm i bootstrap dotenv --save` to add dependencies that we will need in later activities.

4. Copy the `src/` folder from `00-React-App` and paste it into the root of `00-practice-app`.

5. Run `npm start` to ensure that the source files were transplanted successfully.
