# 🐛 Hardcoded Values in JSX

## Before We Begin

Before you begin this activity, complete the following steps:

1. Delete the `/src` folder in [00-practice-app](../00-practice-app/).

2. Copy the `/src` folder from [Unsolved](./Unsolved/src/) and paste it into [00-practice-app](../00-practice-app/).

3. Import Bootstrap into the [index.js](./Unsolved/src/index.js) file:

     `import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'`

## Activity

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue:

* As a user, I want to be able to welcome some students to class by displaying their names in an unordered list on the page along with a welcome message.

* As a developer, I want to use state variables using the `useState` hook and access those variables inside the JSX.

## Expected Behavior

Loading the page will show a greeting message and a list of students from the class in an unordered list. These values should be declared as state variables using the `useState` Hook and accessed inside the JSX with curly braces.

## Actual Behavior

The page seems to have hardcoded values inside the JSX for the greeting and student names.

## 💡 Hints

* What do we need to import in order to use the `useState` Hook?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What are some other Hooks that we can use with React?
