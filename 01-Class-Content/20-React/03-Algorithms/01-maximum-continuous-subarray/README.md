# Maximum Continuous Sub-Array

In this activity, you will create a function that takes in an array and returns the sum of the maximum continuous, or contiguous, subarray. 

> Note: Contiguous refers to items that are next to each other in sequence. In the array [1, 2, 3, -27, 5], for example, [1, 2, 3] is a contiguous subarray while [1, 2, 3, 5] is not, since 5 is not directly next to 3 in the sequence. 

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/maximum-continuous-subarray.js](Unsolved/maximum-continuous-subarray.js) in your code editor. This is the only file you will modify in this activity.

* In this file, you will be writing code in the body of the `maxSumArray` function to achieve the following:

  * Given an array of integers, find the contiguous subarray that has the largest sum.

  * See the following array for an example:

     ```js
     var arr1 = [-1, 2]
     ```

  *  In the case above, the array only contains two integers, so the maximum sum will be the sum of both integers, or 1. 

  * See the following array for an example:

     ```js
     var arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
     ```

   * In the case above, since all the integers are positive, the maximum sum you can get by adding sequential integers is the same as the sum of the array, or 10.

   * See the following array for an example:

     ```js
     var arr1 = [1, 2, -50, 4, 5]
     ```

   * In the case above, the maximum sum you can get from adding sequential numbers is adding the numbers in the subarray [4,5], or 9.

   * See the following array for an example:

     ```js
     var numbers =  [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
     ```

   * In the previous case, the maximum sum you can get from adding sequential numbers is adding the numbers in the subarray [4, -1, 2, 1]. So in this case, 6 should be returned.

   * Assume that the array will contain only integers, and that the integers can be positive or negative. 

   * Assume that if there is only one integer in a given array, the value of the integer will be returned. 

   * Assume that a subarray can contain one or more integers.

* You can check whether your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

   * Functions that pass the tests will be denoted with a green check mark.

   * Functions that fail the tests will be denoted with a red X and an error message.

### Hints

* Which properties and methods on the Math object may help simplify your solution code?

* Why is it important if the array has only positive, only negative, or both positive and negative numbers?
