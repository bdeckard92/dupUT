# Roman Numeral to Int

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that takes in a Roman Numeral string and returns its integer formIf you aren't familiar with Roman Numerals or would like to review them, check out <https://reference.yourdictionary.com/resources/romanums.html>.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/roman-to-int.js](Unsolved/roman-to-int.js) in your code editor -- **this is the only file you will modify in this activity.**

  * In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `romanToInt` function to achieve the following:

    * Return the integer form of the provided Roman Numeral.

    * For example, given the following string:

    ```js
    var str = "V";
    ```

    * The following should be returned:

    ```js
    5;
    ```

    * Given the following string:

    ```js
    var str = "IX";
    ```

    * The following should be returned:

    ```js
    9;
    ```

     * Given the following string:

     ```js
    var str = "MMXXIV";
    ```

    * The following should be returned:

    ```js
    2024;

* You can check to see if your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  * Functions that _pass_ the tests will be denoted with a **green check mark**.

  * Functions that _fail_ the tests will be denoted with a **red x and an error message**.

### Hints

* Start by first making sure you understand Roman Numerals and making sure your function works with the most simple inputs.
