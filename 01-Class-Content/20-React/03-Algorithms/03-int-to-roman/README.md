# Int to Roman Numeral

In this activity, you will create a function that takes in an integer and returns a string that represents the number as a Roman numeral. If you aren't familiar with Roman numerals or want to review them, refer to [Your Dictionary's Roman Numerals Chart, Translation Tips & History](https://reference.yourdictionary.com/resources/romanums.html).

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/int-to-roman.js](Unsolved/int-to-roman.js) in your code editor. This is the only file you will modify in this activity.

  * In this file, you will be writing code in the body of the `intToRoman` function to achieve the following:

    * Return a new string that represents the provided integer in Roman numeral form.

    * For example, see the following number:

       ```js
       var num = 5;
       ```

    * Given the preceding number, the following should be returned:

       ```js
       "V";
       ```

    * See the following integer for an example:

       ```js
       var num = 9;
       ```

    * Given the preceding integer, the following should be returned:

       ```js
       "IX";
       ```

     * See the following integer for another example:

        ```js
       var num = 2024;
       ```

    * Given the preceding integer, the following should be returned:

       ```js
       "MMXXIV";

    * Assume that the provided number will always be a non-negative integer.

* You can check whether your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  * Functions that pass the tests will be denoted with a green check mark.

  * Functions that fail the tests will be denoted with a red X and an error message.

### Hints

* Start by making sure that you understand Roman numerals and that your function works with the simplest inputs.
