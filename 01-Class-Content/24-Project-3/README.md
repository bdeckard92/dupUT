# Module 24: Project 03 Continued

## Overview

Welcome to the second week of Project 03! Youâ€™ve been working hard on your group project during the past week, collaborating with your fellow developers and creating a real-world MERN stack single-page application that you can showcase to potential employers. This week you will continue to work on your group project to create an interactive full-stack MERN application.

At the end of this week, your group will present the application to your classmates. Use the [Project Presentation Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10QaO9KH8HtUXj__81ve0SZcpO5DbMbqqQr4iPpbwKks/edit?usp=sharing) to prepare for the presentation. Because this is a large-scale web application, you should consider concentrating on specific aspects of the project in your presentation, following the principle of the separation of concerns. Though each individual should be able to speak about their individual contributions, this is still a group project. Be sure to emphasize how the different parts of your application came together and how you worked as a group!

## Key Topics

The following topics will be covered in this unit:

* Full-stack applications

* [Git branching workflow](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows)

* [Agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)

* Collaborative development

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-ready if you are able to:

* Speak technically about a feature you implemented in your project

* Explain and execute git branching workflow in a collaborative project

* Resolve merge conflicts

* Explain agile software development

* Design, build and deploy a full-stack MERN application to Heroku

* Prepare a professional presentation and repository README for your project

## Heads Up

* **Each member of your group** is required to submit the deployed application, GitHub repository, and their portfolio with the project added to it on **presentation day**. The code you submit should be as close to finished as possible.

* As you put the final touches on your project, donâ€™t forget to RSVP for your upcoming **Demo Day**. This is your opportunity to showcase your work to employers, practice answering questions about it, and network at the same time. Look for the invitation via email or reach out to your Student Success Manager for the link. You can also reach out to your Career Coach to ask additional questions. Employers are excited to meet you!
