# Pseudo-classes

In this activity, you will take a webpage and style specific elements using pseudo-classes.

## Instructions

* Open the [style.css](Unsolved/assets/css/style.css) file in your IDE and examine the code.

* Using the comments to guide you, add the following styles using only CSS:

  * On hover, the list items will change colors, become bolded, and drop a shadow.

  * Also on hover, the list item icon will change from a potato emoji (ü•î) to a heart emoji (‚ù§Ô∏è).

  * Style the list with alternate background colors.

  * The first line of the first paragraph should be bold.

    * font weight of `900`

    * font size of `x-large`

    * color of `red`
