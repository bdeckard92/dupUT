# Media Queries

In this activity, you will use media queries to ensure the components will stack on top of each other when the screen size gets smaller.

## Instructions

* Open [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) in your browser and open Chrome DevTools to change the screen size. Notice what happens to the components when the screen size gets smaller.

* Open the [style.css](Unsolved/assets/css/style.css) file in your IDE and examine the code. 

* At the bottom of the stylesheet, add media queries for the various screen sizes to change the styles as outlined below:

  * Change the background color to `#333`.

  * Set the width of the `<div>` and the two `<section>`s so that the components will always take up the screen size.

  * Add some padding to the `<div>`

  * Add a margin to the `sidebar` to give it some space from the `main-content` box.
