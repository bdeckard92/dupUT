# Flexbox Card Layout

In this activity, you will use flexbox to organize the cards into two columns and center the contents of the card.

* Open the [style.css](Unsolved/assets/css/style.css) file in your IDE and examine the code. Read the provided comments to understand what the CSS is doing.

  * Using flexbox, position the cards and the contents of the cards to resemble the layout in the following image:
