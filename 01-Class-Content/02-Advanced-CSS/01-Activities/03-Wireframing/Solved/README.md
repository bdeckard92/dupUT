## Activity 03: Wireframing Solved

## Explanation and Result

* We started with our header and sub-heading already defined which leaves us with the body and footer to complete.

* We move down our page to create three elements on the same row.

* If we were to start coding this website, we would place these three elements into a container. This container would determine how our elements would sit on the rows of our web page.

* Inside of our row that is highlighted in red, we see a blue highlighted box which determines how elements sit on the column.

* The container which holds our column acts similar to our row container but on the opposite axis.

* We repeat the steps above to create the next row of our website.

* Finally, we reached the footer of our website which is simply a blocked off area at the bottom of the page.
