### Instructions

* Add more styling to the CSS file such that the `@media screen` code creates padding and margins for the two boxes when the page is below 768px.

* The `meta viewport tag` is required for the Chrome Responsive Tools to actually function, so its important we always add it.

* **NOTE:** This isn't easy. Just give it your best shot. Even if you don't get the exact solution, but are able to better understand how media queries work, that's a solid takeaway.
