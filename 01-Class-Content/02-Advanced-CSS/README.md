# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

A portfolio is often the first point of contact for employers looking to fill a position or clients in need of a developer to complete a project. A clean and informative portfolio showcases a developer's strongest work and can lead to employment and/or more clients. Build a professional portfolio site using HTML and advanced CSS, such as flexbox, CSS Grid Layout, media queries, and CSS variables.

If you don't have enough applications to showcase at this point, add in some placeholder images and names. You can change these to real applications as you create them later in the course.

## User Story

```
AS A web developer
I WANT a deployed portfolio
SO THAT I can showcase my applications to potential employers and clients
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a portfolio
WHEN I load the website
THEN I am presented with my name, a recent photo of me, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about my work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the applications I want to showcase
WHEN I want to feature one of my applications more than the others
THEN that application's image should be displayed first and be larger in size than the others
WHEN I add a new application to the section about my work
THEN the layout for that section should adapt to the size change
WHEN I click on the images of my applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
