# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

A portfolio is often the first point of contact for employers looking to fill a position or clients in need of a developer to complete a project. A clean and informative portfolio showcases a developer's strongest work and can lead to employment and/or more clients. Build a professional portfolio site using HTML and advanced CSS, such as flexbox, CSS Grid Layout, media queries, and CSS variables.

If you don't have enough applications to showcase at this point, add in some placeholder images and names. You can change these to real applications as you create them later in the course.

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio
SO THAT I can review samples of the developer's work
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
