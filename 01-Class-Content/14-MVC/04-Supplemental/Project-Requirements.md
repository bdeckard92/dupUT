# Project Requirements

* Have a polished UI without using Bootstrap. Use alternative CSS frameworks, like Materialize or Semantic UI, instead.

* Use MySQL and Sequelize ORM for the database.

* Use Node and Express with REST APIs.

* Use a template engine, such as Handlebars.js.

* Include authentications (cookies and express-session).

* Have MVC style folder structure.

* Be responsive and interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Be deployed to Heroku.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

* Do not expose API key information (use an ENV file).

* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

* Finally, you must add your project to your portfolio.

**More details about the project will be provided in the lessons for Module 15 in Canvas.**
