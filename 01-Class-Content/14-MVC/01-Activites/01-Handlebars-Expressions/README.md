* As a party guest, I want to see a description of one food item that will be at the potluck when I visit `http://localhost:3001/dish/:num`.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the route called `/dish/:num` is properly configured to retrieve and return a food item and its description.

* It's done when the view displays a description for the food item, where the list number matches the route `/dish/:num`.
