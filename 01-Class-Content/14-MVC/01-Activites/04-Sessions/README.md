# 📐 Add Comments to Sessions in the Login Route

Work with a partner to add comments describing the functionality of the code found in [home-routes.js](./Unsolved/controllers/home-routes.js) and [painting.handlebars](./Unsolved/views/painting.handlebars).

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation:
  
[Express.js documentation on express-session](http://expressjs.com/en/advanced/best-practice-security.html#use-cookies-securely)

Note the following:

* Visitors can view gallery's paintings after they login.

* Visitors can maintain a session between visits to the site.

* To test the routes, feel free to either create your own user or use the following credentials:

  * Username: "Sam"

  * Email: "sam@email.com"

  * Password: "password1234"

If the session variables are set up when the user is created or logged in, which file would hold that info? How can the templates know whether the user is logged in or not? What built-in helper method will help us render specific content depending on whether the user is logged in or not?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What is the lifecycle of a session?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
