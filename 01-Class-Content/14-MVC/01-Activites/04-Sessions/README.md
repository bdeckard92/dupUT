  * `username`: "Sam"
  
  * `email`: "sam@email.com"
  
  * `password`: "password1234"

* If the session variables are set up when the user is created or logged in, which file would hold that info?

* How can the templates know if the user is logged in or not?

* What built-in helper method will help us render specific content depending on whether the user is logged in or not?
