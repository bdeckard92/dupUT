# 🏗️ Use Handlebars.js Partials to Reuse a Template

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to be able to render details of a painting by reusing the same Handlebars.js template.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the details for the paintings associated with the gallery are rendered using a Handlebars.js partial in the [gallery.handlebars](./Unsolved/views/gallery.handlebars) file.

* It's done when the `painting-details.handlebars` partial renders a card that links to that painting's page.

* It's done when the card includes a header with the painting's title.

* It's done when the card includes a body with the painting and the artist's name.

## Assets

The following image demonstrates how the painting's details should be rendered on the page:
