# Common Element

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that takes in two arrays of numbers, with one number in common between the two arrays. Your function should return the number in common between the two arrays.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/common-element.js](Unsolved/common-element.js) in your code editor&mdash;this is the only file you will modify in this activity.

  * In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `commonElement` function, to achieve the following:

    * Return the number in common between the two given arrays.

    * Refer to the following arrays for an example:

      ```js
      // The number 1 is present in both arrays
      var arrA = [1, 9, 8, 7];
      var arrB = [10, 12, 1, 6, 5];
      ```

    * Given the preceding arrays, the following should be returned:

      ```js
      1
      ```

    > **Important:** You may not use the `indexOf` or `includes` methods to complete this problem.

* You can check whether your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  * Functions that pass the tests will be denoted with a green check mark.

  * Functions that fail the tests will be denoted with a red X and an error message.

### Hints

You might want to use the code from the previous `zeroes-and-ones` activity in your solution for this problem.
