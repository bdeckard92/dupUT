# Double Triple Map

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a transformed array where even numbers are doubled and odd numbers are tripled.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/double-triple-map.js](Unsolved/double-triple-map.js) in your code editor -- **this is the only file you will modify in this activity.**

  * In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `doubleTripleMap` function to achieve the following:

    * Return a new array derived from the original array. Each element in the new array should correspond each element in the original array. The element at each index of the new array should be double the original element if it is even, else triple the original if it is odd.

    * For example, given the following array:

    ```js
    var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
    ```

    * The following array should be returned:

    ```js
    [3, 4, 9, 8]
    ```

* You can check to see if your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  * Functions that _pass_ the tests will be denoted with a **green check mark**.

  * Functions that _fail_ the tests will be denoted with a **red x and an error message**.
