# Relative Paths

In this activity, you will correctly link the various `style.css` files using relative paths.

## Instructions

* Open the [index.html](Unsolved/public/index.html) file and notice the `<head>` section with the links to the CSS stylesheets.

* Correctly link the three `style.css` files found in the `public` directory to the `index.html` file to ensure the HTML file renders according to the following image:

  * Do not move any of the files! You only need to add the relative paths in the `<link>` tags.
