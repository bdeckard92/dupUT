# GitHub Pages Personal

In this activity, you will publish your own Personal site using GitHub Pages.

## Instructions

1. Create a new repo that is named `<<YOUR USERNAME>>.github.io` where `<<YOUR USERNAME>>` is your GitHub username. 

  * Double check that you use your exact username. (For example, `janedoe.github.io` would be the GitHub pages repo name for the GitHub user `janedoe`)

2. Clone your repository into your work directory.

3. Add an HTML file named `index.html` and code out a basic webpage.

4. Add, commit, and push your changes into the repository.

5. Navigate to `<<YOUR_USERNAME>>.github.io` and you will find that your new web page has gone live! (again, where <<YOUR USERNAME>> is your GitHub username.)

## Hint(s)

If you need help, consult the [GitHub Pages documentation](https://pages.github.com/).
