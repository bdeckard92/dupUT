# Relative Paths

## Instructions

Modify each of the four `html-bio.html` pages such that they can access the CSS inside their folder. Don't move the CSS file, and don't move the HTML file.

## Hint(s):

If you need some reading material on relative paths, read [Dealing with files](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Dealing_with_files)
