# GitHub Pages Personal

Now that we have gone over how to create a personal website using GitHub Pages, it is time to publish your own personal website! See the guide below as a reminder of what steps you need to take.

## Instructions

1. Create a new repo that is named `<<YOUR USERNAME>>.github.io` where `<<YOUR USERNAME>>` is your GitHub username. Double check that you use exactly your username. (For example, `janedoe.github.io` would be the GitHub pages repo name for the GitHub user "janedoe")

2. Clone your repository into your work directory

3. Add an HTML file named `index.html` and code out a basic webpage (or use a previous page)

4. Add, commit, and push your changes into the repository

5. Navigate to `<<YOUR_USERNAME>>.github.io` and you will find that your new web page has gone live! (again, where <<YOUR USERNAME>> is your GitHub username.)
