            <h2>Graywater Treatment</h2>
            <p>
                Graywater, or domestic wastewater, can be re-used for garden irrigation, providing both produce and
                flowering plants. It can also help with domestic water needs, replacing the water used in laundry and
                toilets.

            <h2>Solar Energy</h2>
            <p>
                Solar panels help you to save money on monthly electricity bills, but they can also increase your home
                value. Businesses and residents can take advantage of tax incentives and feel confident that they're
                reducing their carbon footprint.
