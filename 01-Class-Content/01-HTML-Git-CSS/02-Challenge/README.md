# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

Refactor an existing webpage to make it accessible. You should also ensure that all links are functioning correctly and clean up the CSS to make it more efficient. Use Git workflow and best practices to deploy the refactored webpage to GitHub pages.

## User Story

```
AS A developer working with a legacy codebase
I WANT to refactor my HTML and CSS
SO THAT it meets accessibility standards
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a webpage that meets accessibility standards
WHEN the HTML elements don't accurately describe their purpose and the type of content that is inside them
THEN I change the elements to semantic elements
WHEN I click each navigation link at the top of the page
THEN I am taken to a specific place on that page that matches the link
WHEN my images don't include alt attributes
THEN I add alt attributes that meet accessibility standards
WHEN the CSS is inefficient and repeats selectors and properties
THEN I refactor my CSS to consolidate selectors and properties
WHEN the CSS selectors do not follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements
THEN I reorganize the selectors to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements
WHEN the CSS does not include comments before each element or section of the page
THEN I add comments to describe each element or section
WHEN I modify the HTML and CSS
THEN the webpage meets accessibility standards
```
