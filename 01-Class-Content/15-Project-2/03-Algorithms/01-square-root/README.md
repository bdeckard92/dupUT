# Square Root

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that takes a positive integer and returns its square root.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/square-root.js](Unsolved/square-root.js) in your code editor -- **this is the only file you will modify in this activity.**

  * In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `sqrt` function to achieve the following:

    * Return the square root of the passed in integer. If the square root is a decimal number, round it down to a whole integer before returning it.

    * For example, given the following number:

    ```js
    var num = 25;
    ```

    * The following number should be returned:

    ```js
    5;
    ```

    * Given the following number:

     ```js
    var num = 6;
    ```

    * The following number should be returned:

    ```js
    2;
    ```

    * Since the square root of `6` is â‰ˆ`2.45`, we round it down to `2`.

    * You may not use the built-in `Math.sqrt` method.

* You can check to see if your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  * Functions that _pass_ the tests will be denoted with a **green check mark**.

  * Functions that _fail_ the tests will be denoted with a **red x and an error message**.
