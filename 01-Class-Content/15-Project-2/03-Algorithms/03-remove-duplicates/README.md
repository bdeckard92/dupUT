# Remove Duplicates

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that takes a sorted array of integers and then modifies the array to remove any duplicates.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/remove-duplicates.js](Unsolved/remove-duplicates.js) in your code editor -- **this is the only file you will modify in this activity.**

  * In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `removeDuplicates` function to achieve the following:

    * Remove duplicates from the original array so that each number present appears only once.

    * For example, given the following array:

    ```js
    var arr = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 9, 9];
    ```

    * The array should be updated to the following:

    ```js
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 9];
    ```

    * Do not create a new array, instead modify the provided array.

    * There is no need to return anything from this function.

* You can check to see if your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  * Functions that _pass_ the tests will be denoted with a **green check mark**.

  * Functions that _fail_ the tests will be denoted with a **red x and an error message**.

### Hint

* How can you use the fact that the array is sorted to help solve this problem?
