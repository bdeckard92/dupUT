# Camel Case

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that takes a string and returns the string in camelCase.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/camel-case.js](Unsolved/camel-case.js) in your code editor -- **this is the only file you will modify in this activity.**

  * In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `camelCase` function to achieve the following:

    * Return a camelCased version of the given string.

    * A string is camelCased when there are no spaces between words, the first letters of each word except the first word is capitalized and all other letters are lowerCased.

    * For example, given the following string:

    ```js
    var str = "let the force flow through you";
    ```

    * The following string should be returned:

    ```js
    "letTheForceFlowThroughYou";
    ```

* You can check to see if your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  * Functions that _pass_ the tests will be denoted with a **green check mark**.

  * Functions that _fail_ the tests will be denoted with a **red x and an error message**.
