# Product of Largest Two

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that takes an array of numbers, finds the largest two numbers in the array, and returns the product of both numbers.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/product-of-largest-two.js](Unsolved/product-of-largest-two.js) in your code editor -- **this is the only file you will modify in this activity.**

  * In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `productOfLargestTwo` function to achieve the following:

    * Find the largest and the second largest numbers in the given array.

    * Return the product of the largest and the second largest number.

    * For example, given the following array:

    ```js
    var arr = [10, 20, 9, 6, 3]; // largest is 20, secondLargest is 10
    ```

    * The following number should be returned:

    ```js
    200
    ```

    * **The given array will always contain at least 2 elements.**

* You can check to see if your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  * Functions that _pass_ the tests will be denoted with a **green check mark**.

  * Functions that _fail_ the tests will be denoted with a **red x and an error message**.
