# 🏗️ Implement and Use for...of Loops

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to be able to use `for...of` loops to iterate through data inside an array.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have iterated through the `songs` array with a `for...of` loop and logged each in a cyan color.

## 💡 Hints

What is the iterable we will use in our `for...of` loop?

How can we use the provided `outputCyanText()` method to console log text in a specific color?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How could you iterate through deeply nested objects?
