# Functional Loops

In this activity, you will use the `map` and `filter` methods to solve problems we previously would have used a `for` loop for.

## Instructions

* Open [map.js](Unsolved/map.js) and create the following:

  1. A map that triples the `originalArray` and sets the result equal to a new array, `tripledArray`.

  2. A map that takes the `originalArray` and returns a new array `oddOrEven` containing the text "even" if the number is even and the text "odd" if the number is odd. 
    
    * For example, using this map, the array [3, 1, 2, 4] should give us back ["odd", "odd", "even", "even"].

* Open [filter.js](Unsolved/filter.js) and create the following:

  1. A filter that runs through the `originalArray` and creates a new array `primeArray` containing only its prime numbers. You will need to use the `isPrime` function provided.

  2. A filter that runs through the `originalArray` and creates a new array `moreThan5Array` containing only its numbers larger than 5.

## Bonus

* Use arrow functions as callbacks.
