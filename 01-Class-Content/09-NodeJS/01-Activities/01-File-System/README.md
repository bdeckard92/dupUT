# File System Methods

In this activity, you will read and write text to a file using the `fs` package.

## Instructions

* Create a `index.js` file.

* The app should accept a command line argument and use it to create a text file and write to it. 

* Also include a method that will read the newly created text file. 

## Hint(s)

* You may need to consult [the Node.js `fs` documentation](link) for the appropriate method and its usage.
