# File System Methods

In this activity, you will read and write text to a file using the `fs` package.

## Instructions

* In the [Unsolved](Unsolved/) folder, create a `index.js` file.

* Import the `fs` module

* Write a method that will accept a command line argument and use it to create a text file and write to it. If there are no errors, it should print "Done!" in the console. 

* Write a method that will read the newly created text file and log its contents in the console.

## Hint(s)

* You may need to consult [the Node.js `fs` documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) for the appropriate method and its usage.
