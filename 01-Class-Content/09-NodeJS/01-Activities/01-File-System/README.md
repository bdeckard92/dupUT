# File System Methods

In this activity, you will read and write text to a file using `fs`.

## Instructions

* Create a Node application, `index.js`, that accepts a command line argument in order to create a text file and write to it. 

    * What dependency you will need? 

* Also include a method that will read the newly created text file. 

* You may need to consult the Node.js `fs` documentation for the appropriate method and its usage.

## Bonus

* How can we append text to the file instead of overwriting it?
