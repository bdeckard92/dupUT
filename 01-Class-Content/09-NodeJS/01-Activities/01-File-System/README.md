# File System Methods

In this activity, you will generate non-existent files and also overwrite a file using `fs`.


## Instructions

* Initialize your repository. Create a Node application, `index.js`, that accepts a command line argument that creates a text file and writes to it. 

    * What dependency you will need? 

* You may need to consult the Node.js `fs` documentation for the appropriate method and its usage. 


## Hint(s)
