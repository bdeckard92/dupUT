# 📖 Implement and Recognize Object Destructuring

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to be able to pull out data from objects and arrays into variables.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It is done when I have destructured the objects to pull out the data that is logged in the console.

* It is done when I have destructured the array to pull out the data that is logged in the console.

* It is done when I have run `node index.js` after destructuring to confirm the values logged in the console.

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation:

[MDN Web Docs on object destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment)

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How can we take a property from an object and assign it to a variable with a different name when we are destructuring it?
