# 🏗️ Build CLI App Using Inquirer

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to create a command-line application that takes input from the user and does something with it.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It is done when I have initialized my repository with a `package.json` file by running `npm init -y`.

* It is done when I have installed Inquirer and added it to my list of dependencies by running `npm i inquirer --save`.

* It is done when the application asks the user, "What is your name?"

* It is done when the application asks the user, "What languages do you know?"

* It is done when the application asks the user, “What is your preferred method of communication?"

* It is done after I have written those responses to a file.

## 💡 Hints

* Why do we need to use `JSON.stringify`? 
  
* How can we use the npm page for Inquirer to see how to use checkboxes and lists?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How would you format your JSON? Can you generate the name of your user file from the user input?
