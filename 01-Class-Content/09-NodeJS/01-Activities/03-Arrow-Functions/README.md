# Arrow Functions

In this activity, you will convert functions to use ES6 arrow functions where suitable.

## Instructions

* Navigate to [Unsolved](Unsolved/) in your command line and run `node index.js`

  * Take a few moments to study the values logged to the console, but don't worry about understanding every part of the code. For this activity you only need to remember the rules established about when arrow functions should and shouldn't be used.

* Open the [index.js](Unsolved/index.js) file and convert the functions to use arrow functions **where suitable**. If successful, the code should work exactly the same after the changes. 

## Bonus

* After you've converted all of the functions to arrow functions where possible, look for opportunities to shorten the arrow function syntax even further by removing parentheses and curly braces where allowed.

*  Use `let` and `const` instead of `var` when declaring variables.
