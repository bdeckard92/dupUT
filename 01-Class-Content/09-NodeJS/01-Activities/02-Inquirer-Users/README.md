# Inquirer Users

In this activity, you will build a simple command line application that accepts user input and writes it to a `.json` file. 

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/index.js](Unsolved/index.js) and install the `inquirer` dependency.

* Prompt your user with the following questions:

    * "What is your name?"

    * "What is your preferred method of communication?"
    
    * "What languages do you know?"

* Then write the user response to a file using the given callback function by chaining this callback method to the prompt.

## Hint(s)

* You may need to consult [the `inquirer` documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) on how to prompt users for lists and checkboxes.


## Bonus

* Can you generate the name of your user file from their input?
