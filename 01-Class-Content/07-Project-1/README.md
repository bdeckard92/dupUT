# Module 07: Project 1

## Overview

Welcome to Project 1! This is an important step in your full-stack journey as you will now use your newly acquired skills and knowledge to build web application from scratch. With your team, you will conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests.

Because you will be working collaboratively, you will learn agile development methodologies and implement feature and bug fixes using Git branch workflow and pull requests.

## Key Topics

The following topics will be covered in this module:

* [Server-side APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_API)

* [Git branching workflow](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows)

* [Agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-ready if you are able to:

* Speak technically about a feature you implemented in your project.

* Explain and execute Git branching workflow in a collaborative project.

* Resolve merge conflicts.
