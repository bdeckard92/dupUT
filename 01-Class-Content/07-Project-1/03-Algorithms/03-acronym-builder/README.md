# Acronym Builder

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that takes a string and returns the [acronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym) for the given string.

## Instructions

- Open [Unsolved/acronym-builder.js](Unsolved/acronym-builder.js) in your code editor -- **this is the only file you will modify in this activity.**

  - In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `acronymBuilder` function to achieve the following:

    - Return a new string that is an acronym of the given string.

    - For example, given the following string:

    ```js
    var str = "For your information";
    ```

    - return:

    ```js
    "FYI";
    ```

- You can check to see if your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  - Functions that _pass_ the tests will be denoted with a **green check mark**.

  - Functions that _fail_ the tests will be denoted with a **red x and an error message**.
