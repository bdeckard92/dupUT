# Swap Case

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that swaps the letter case of each character in a string.

## Instructions

- Open [Unsolved/swap-case.js](Unsolved/swap-case.js) in your code editor -- **this is the only file you will modify in this activity.**

  - In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `swapCase` function to achieve the following:

    - Return a string identical to the given `str` string, but with the letter case of each character swapped.

    - e.g. given the following string:

    ```js
    var str = "Luke, I Am Your Father";
    ```

    - The following string should be returned:

    ```js
    "lUKE, i aM yOUR fATHER";
    ```

- You can check to see if your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  - Functions that _pass_ the tests will be denoted with a **green check mark**.

  - Functions that _fail_ the tests will be denoted with a **red x and an error message**.
