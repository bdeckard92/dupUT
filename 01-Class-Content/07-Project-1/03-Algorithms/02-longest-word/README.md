# Longest Word

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that takes a string containing space-separated words and returns the longest word in the string.

## Instructions

- Open [Unsolved/longest-word.js](Unsolved/longest-word.js) in your code editor -- **this is the only file you will modify in this activity.**

  - In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `longestWord` function to achieve the following:

    - Return the longest word in the given string (`str`).

    - e.g. given the following string:

    ```js
    var str = "i love programming";
    ```

    - The following string should be returned:

    ```js
    "programming
    ```

- You can check to see if your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  - Functions that _pass_ the tests will be denoted with a **green check mark**.

  - Functions that _fail_ the tests will be denoted with a **red x and an error message**.
