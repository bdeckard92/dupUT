# SQL JOIN

In this activity, you will join the `books` and `authors` data together using JOIN queries.

## Instructions 

* In the [join.sql](Unsolved/join.sql) file, write JOIN queries for the following: 

	* show ALL books with authors

	* show ALL books, even if we don't know the author

	* show ALL authors, even if we don't know the book

* To check our work, initiate the MySQL Shell. Be sure your MySQL Server is running!

* To needed, rebuild and seed the database.

* To check if everything was done correctly, execute the `join.sql` file in the MySQL command line.

* To exit the MySQL command line, type `quit;` or `exit;`

## Hint(s)

* Think of when you would use the `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `INNER JOIN` queries.
