# üêõ MySQL Table Isn't Being Created to Specifications

Work with a partner to resolve the following issues:

* As a developer, I want a MySQL table with the same name as the Sequelize model.

* As a developer, I want a more descriptive primary key name in the MySQL table.

## Expected Behavior

When Sequelize syncs the model with the database, the table name should be `book` (singular) and the primary key name should be `book_id`.

## Actual Behavior

The table name is `books`, and the primary key is `id`.

## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

1. Run `npm start` from the command line to start the server and sync the database.

2. Run `mysql -u root -p` to log in to the MySQL shell.

3. In the MySQL shell, run `USE library_db;` to switch to the library database.

4. Try to run `DESCRIBE book;`. It will fail because the table name is `books`.

5. Run `DESCRIBE books;`. Note that the primary key is named `id` and not `book_id`.
