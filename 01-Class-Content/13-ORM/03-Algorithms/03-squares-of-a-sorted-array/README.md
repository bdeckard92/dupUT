# Squares of a Sorted Array

In this activity, you will be writing code to create a function that takes an array of integers sorted in ascending (increasing) order, then returns a new array containing the squares of each number in ascending order.

## Instructions

Open [Unsolved/squares-of-a-sorted-array.js](Unsolved/squares-of-a-sorted-array.js) in your code editor&mdash;this is the only file you will modify in this activity.

* In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `sortedSquares` function to achieve the following:

  * Return a new array containing the squares of each number in the first array in sorted order.

  * Refer to the following array for an example:

    ```js
    var arr = [-4, -1, 0, 3, 10];
    ```

  * Given the preceding array, the following should be returned:

    ```js
    [0, 1, 9, 16, 100];
    ```

  * Refer to the following array for another example:

     ```js
    var arr = [-7, -3, 2, 3, 11];
    ```

  * Given the preceding array, the following should be returned:

    ```js
    [4, 9, 9, 49, 121];
    ```

  * Notice how squaring a number might change its order in the new array. For instance, `-7` is less than `2`, but `-7` squared is greater than `2` squared.

* You can check whether your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  * Functions that PASS the tests will be denoted with a green check mark.

  * Functions that FAIL the tests will be denoted with a red X and an error message.
