# Common Element

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that takes in two arrays of numbers with one number in common between the two arrays. Your function should return the number in common between the two arrays.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/common-element.js](Unsolved/common-element.js) in your code editor -- **this is the only file you will modify in this activity.**

  * In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `commonElement` function to achieve the following:

    * Return the number in common between the two given arrays.

    * For example, given the following arrays:

    ```js
    // The number 1 is present in both arrays
    var arrA = [1, 9, 8, 7];
    var arrB = [10, 12, 1, 6, 5];
    ```

    * The following should be returned:

    ```js
    1
    ```

    * **You may not use the `indexOf` or `includes` methods to complete this problem.**

* You can check to see if your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  * Functions that _pass_ the tests will be denoted with a **green check mark**.

  * Functions that _fail_ the tests will be denoted with a **red x and an error message**.

### Hints

* You may want to utilize the code from the previous `zeroes-and-ones` activity in your solution for this problem.
