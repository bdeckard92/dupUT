# Double Triple Map

In this activity, you will be writing code to create a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a transformed array, where even numbers are doubled and odd numbers are tripled.

## Instructions

Open [Unsolved/double-triple-map.js](Unsolved/double-triple-map.js) in your code editor&mdash;this is the only file you will modify in this activity.

* In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `doubleTripleMap` function to achieve the following:

  * Return a new array derived from the original array. Each element in the new array should correspond to an element in the original array. The element at each index of the new array should be double the original element if it is even and triple the original if it is odd.

  * Refer to the following array for an example:

    ```js
    var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
    ```

  * Given the preceding array, the following should be returned:

    ```js
    [3, 4, 9, 8]
    ```

* You can check whether your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  * Functions that PASS the tests will be denoted with a green check mark.

  * Functions that FAIL the tests will be denoted with a red X and an error message.
