# Array Intersection

In this activity, you will be writing code to create a function that takes two arrays and returns a new array that is the intersection of both arrays. An **array intersection** in this activity is defined as the set of same-number pairs between both arrays. There might be multiple pairs of the same number between both arrays, so a number might appear more than one time in the result.

## Instructions

Open [Unsolved/array-intersection.js](Unsolved/array-intersection.js) in your code editor&mdash;this is the only file you will modify in this activity.

* In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `arrayIntersection` function to achieve the following:

  * Return a new array containing the intersection of both passed-in arrays.

  * See the following array for an example:

    ```js
    var arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4];
    var arr2 = [3, 4, 5, 6];
    ```

  * Because both arrays contain one `3` and one `4`, the following should be returned:

    ```js
    [3, 4];
    ```

  * See the following array for another example:

    ```js
    var arr1 = [8, 88, 8, 90, 91, 8];
    var arr2 = [90, 8, 8, 15, 3];
    ```

  * Because both arrays contain the number `90` once and the number `8` at least twice, the following array should be returned:

    ```js
    [90, 8, 8];
    ```

  > **Important:** You don't need to worry about the order of the elements in the returned array.

* You can check to see if your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  * Functions that PASS the tests will be denoted with a green check mark.

  * Functions that FAIL the tests will be denoted with a red X and an error message.
