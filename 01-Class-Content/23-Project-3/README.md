# Unit 23: Project 3

## Overview

Our journey together is coming to an end, but this is just the beginning for yours as a full-stack web developer. Just about six months ago, you started the transformative journey towards becoming a web developer. Don’t diminish your accomplishments&mdash;you’ve done something extraordinary, and you should be immensely proud of your work! 

Remember, developers never stop learning and adding to their skillsets. You’ve had plenty of practice at this throughout the course. Make no mistake&mdash;you are now well equipped to succeed as a professional full-stack web developer!

This module and the next are similar to the previous group project modules. During the next two weeks, you’ll work with your group to create an interactive MERN stack single-page application. In creating your first collaborative MERN stack single-page application, you’ll combine a scalable MongoDB back end, a GraphQL API, and an Express.js and Node.js server with a React front end, implementing user authentication with JWT to build a user-focused platform. You’ll continue to build on the agile development methodologies you’ve used throughout this course. These include storing your project code in GitHub, managing your work with a project management tool, and implementing feature and bug fixes using the Git branch workflow and pull requests. 

## Key Topics
