# Unit 23: Project 3

## Overview

Our journey together is coming to an end, but this is just the beginning for yours as a full-stack web developer. Just about six months ago, you started the transformative journey towards becoming a web developer. Don’t diminish your accomplishments&mdash;you’ve done something extraordinary, and you should be immensely proud of your work! You started by mastering the foundational front-end technologies that all websites use. Next, you added back-end technologies to create full-stack applications. Finally, you learned how to make applications more performant and efficient by using cutting-edge technologies to create scalable MERN stack applications.

Remember, developers never stop learning and adding to their skillsets. You’ve had plenty of practice at this throughout the course. Make no mistake&mdash;you are now well equipped to succeed as a professional full-stack web developer!

This module and the next are similar to the previous group project modules. During the next two weeks, you’ll work with your group to create an interactive MERN stack single-page application. In creating your first collaborative MERN stack single-page application, you’ll combine a scalable MongoDB back end, a GraphQL API, and an Express.js and Node.js server with a React front end, implementing user authentication with JWT to build a user-focused platform. You’ll continue to build on the agile development methodologies you’ve used throughout this course. These include storing your project code in GitHub, managing your work with a project management tool, and implementing feature and bug fixes using the Git branch workflow and pull requests. 

## Key Topics

* Collaborative full-stack development

* Git workflow in groups

1. Why did you choose a certain technology, like the MERN stack? 

2. What was your collaborative process? 

3. How did you decide who would work on what? 

4. How did you communicate with your group members? 

5. How did you contribute specifically to the project? 

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-competitive if you are able to:

* Polish your professional-grade portfolio to show all 3 deployed group projects, in addition to 2-3 of your best homework assignments or personal projects. 

* Make sure that each project has a professional README outlining its functionality, the tech stack, and the build process including any challenges faced and how they were overcome. 

* Draft a resume detailing your newly acquired skillset.
