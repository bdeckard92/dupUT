# Mongoose Schema

In this activity, you will create a schema for the User model with Mongoose.

## Instructions

* Open [User.js](Unsolved/models/User.js) and add the following four attributes to your schema:

  * `username`: A string that will be trimmed and required with a custom error message, i.e. 'Username is Required'. 

  * `password`: A string that will be trimmed, required with a custom error message, and at least 6 characters.

  * `email`: A string that must be a valid email address and unique in our collection.

  * `userCreated`: A date that will default to the current date.

* To test it out, run `npm install` and `npm start` in your command line to start the server.

  * Open Insomnia and make a POST request to `/submit` with data for a new user in JSON format.

  * You should see your new user created in the data returned from our POST request. 

  * Try creating a user without a username or invalid email address. You should see an error message returned.

## Hint(s)

* To check if an email address is valid, you can use `match` to create a validator that checks if the value matches the given regex, which for checking if a string is an email is: `/.+\@.+\..+/`.

* You can refer to the Mongoose docs on [Validations](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/validation.html) or on [String Validators](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/schematypes.html#string-validators).
