# Full-Stack Course Overview

Some of the most important factors influencing how well and how quickly you learn something new include not only how you structure and sequence your learning, but also how you stay motivated and curious in the material, and how you leverage your prior knowledge to build new knowledge you can apply in different situations. Learning to become a web-developer is not easy and will take a lot of internal drive and outside support. To make that journey a bit easier, the course curriculum is structured and sequenced to keep motivation high and connections between concepts clear. Here’s how the class is broken down.

Our first third of the course is focused on the front-end, the things you see and interact with in the browser, like when you click a ‘login’ button and a box pops up. Front-end languages, techniques, and libraries are foundational to being a full-stack developer, and are areas you’ll continuously build on top of throughout the course.

## Project 1

The boot camp will be taxing, and having something you can look back on and be proud of early in the course helps keep motivation and morale high. It’s very possible to build a cool interactive web application in the first few weeks by developing the front-end yourself and leveraging other people’s servers and APIs. For example, Food Finder is a student-made app that helps you find recipes and Fourth and Lawn is another student-made app that helps you find parking at sporting events.

You could stop here and look for jobs as a front-end web developer, but the field demands more and there’s lots of opportunities for developers who can build their own back-end. Over the next 10 units, we’ll do just that. Having a back-end allows us to utilize a server to make and receive requests from our front-end. So, if you clicked a ‘login’ button and filled out your user information in the box, when you click submit, those credentials are validated via a back-end server.

In the second block of this course you will learn to build your own server code. As mentioned earlier, the second factor influencing how strong and quickly you learn something new is how you are able to take what you already know and make helpful connections with new material in order to develop a solid understanding of new concepts.

## Project 2

As a final project for the second block, we combine your ability to create a front-end website with your new ability to write server code, in order to create a site that interacts with your server code.

Starting your second project from scratch instead of using the front-end you’ve already developed helps reinforce your existing front-end abilities and solidify how you conceive of the front-end and back-end dynamic. If your front-end fundamentals are not strong at the end of the first project, you won't be building on a weak foundation. Take a look at one student who used JSON web tokens to make Recruit Analyzer, a basketball recruit simulator.

The third block primarily focuses on React and Computer Science fundamentals. React is a popular front-end advanced library that has taken off over the last few years. Why do we go back to the front-end at the very end? Well, unlike JQuery, React brings a certain level of abstraction that is harder to grasp without a working understanding of the back-end. React will allow for us to create highly reusable components. Instead of having to create the same element multiple times, React allows us to create it once, and render it as many times as necessary for our application. We can even dynamically render these components to populate information as needed, and not take up more memory than necessary.

We’ll also cover Computer Science fundamentals, which are essential to web development so our curriculum includes a deep dive into the basics of coding and algorithms. While this content is no replacement for a Computer Science Degree, you will learn what you need to know to work efficiently and create optimized code. Things like sorting algorithms and Big O notation are very important to code efficiency, and will be something you think about when writing applications throughout your career.

## Project 3

As a capstone to the boot camp, you’ll work in groups to build novel full-stack applications that utilize a wide swath of the languages and libraries you learned over the course of these past few months. We can’t wait to see what you build!
