# Roman Numeral to Int

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that takes in a Roman numeral string and returns its integer form. If you aren't familiar with Roman numerals or would like to review them, refer to this [guide to Roman numerals](https://reference.yourdictionary.com/resources/romanums.html).

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/roman-to-int.js](Unsolved/roman-to-int.js) in your code editor -- this is the only file you will modify in this activity.

  * In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `romanToInt()` function to achieve the following:

    * Return the integer form of the provided Roman numeral.

      * See the following string for an example:

        ```js
        var str = "V";
        ```

      * Given the preceding string, the following should be returned:

        ```js
        5;
        ```

      * See the following string for another example:

        ```js
        var str = "IX";
        ```

      * Given the preceding string, the following should be returned:

        ```js
        9;
        ```

      * See the following string for another example:

          ```js
          var str = "MMXXIV";
          ```

      * Given the preceding string, the following should be returned:

        ```js
        2024;
        ```

* You can check whether your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  * Functions that pass the tests will be denoted with a green check mark.

  * Functions that fail the tests will be denoted with a red X and an error message.

### Hints

Start by making sure that you understand Roman numerals and then check that your function works with the most simple inputs.
