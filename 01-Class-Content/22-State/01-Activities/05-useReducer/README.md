# 📖 Implement useReducer for a Component

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer I want to use a Hook to define and respond to actions in my app, allowing me to have better control over complex state changes.

## Setup

Copy the `src` directory from the `Unsolved` folder into `00-practice-app` before you begin.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have used `studentContext` to provide the initial state for my reducer.

* It's done when I have implemented `onClick` actions for adding and removing students using `dispatch()`.

* It's done when the component renders correctly without errors in the browser.

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation:

[React documentation on useReducer](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer)

## 💡 Hints

What arguments do `useReducer()` and `dispatch()` expect?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How would you explain Redux to a friend or family member?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
