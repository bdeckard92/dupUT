# Redux Documentation

In this activity, you will read through the official Redux documentation to not only learn about Redux, but also practice reading official documentation and implementing what you learned to your code. We will NOT be using `Book-Lounge` for this activity.

## Instructions

**Part 1**

* Work with your group to answer each of the following questions using the [Redux Documentation](https://redux.js.org/).

  1. When should you use Redux?

  2. How do you create a store in Redux?

  3. How are reducers in Redux different from reducers in Context API?

  4. How do you connect the Redux store to React?

  5. What were some similarities between Redux and React Context API?

**Part 2**

* Using what you read about Redux, create a Redux [store](Unsolved/store.js) and refactor [reducers.js](Unsolved/reducers.js) and [App.js](Unsolved/App.js) to use the Redux store.

## Hint(s)

* Check out "Getting Started with Redux" and the "Basic Tutorial" in the Redux Docs to guide you through the activity. 

* Do not worry if you can't finish Part 2. This activity is a preview of what you will do on your Challenge.
