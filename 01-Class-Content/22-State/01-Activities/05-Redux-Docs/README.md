# Redux Documentation

In this activity, you will read through the official Redux documentation to not only learn about Redux, but also practice reading official documentation and implementing what you learned to your code. 

## Instructions

**Part 1**

* Work with your group to answer each of the following questions using the [Redux Documentation](https://redux.js.org/).

  1. When should you use Redux?

  2. How do you create a store in Redux?

  3. How are reducers in Redux different from reducers in Context API?

  4. How do you connect the Redux store to React?

  5. What were some similarities between Redux and React Context API?

**Part 2**

* **Note** You will be using one web application, [00-React-App](../00-React-App), for all of our activities today.

* Copy the [src](Unsolved/src) folder and paste it into the `00-React-App` app inside the [client](../00-React-App/client) folder. 

* Using what you read about Redux, create a Redux [store](../00-React-App/client/src/utils/store.js) and refactor [reducers.js](../00-React-App/client/src/utils/reducers.js) and [App.js](../00-React-App/client/src/App.js) to use the Redux store.

* Navigate to [01-Activities/00-React-App](../00-React-App) and start the app in dev mode by running `npm start` from your command line.

* Check out the application running on <http://localhost:3000> in your browser and you should see the store with the initial state on the page.

* Press `CTRL + C` to stop the server.

## Hint(s)

* Check out "Getting Started with Redux" and the "Basic Tutorial" in the Redux Docs to guide you through the activity. 

* Don't worry if you can't finish Part 2. This activity is a preview of what you will do on your Challenge.
