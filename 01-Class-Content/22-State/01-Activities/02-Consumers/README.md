# 🏗️ Access and Update Global State Using React Context Hooks

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to have access to a global state object to avoid passing props down through multiple child components.

## Setup

Copy the `src` directory from the unsolved folder into `00-practice-app` before you begin.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the `studentList` component pulls the global state variables `students` and `majors`.

* It's done when the `studentList` components add and remove buttons to update the global state object.

* It's done when changes in global state are reflected in necessary components.

* It's done when the components render properly in the browser.
