# üèóÔ∏è Implement Global State Using React Context API

Using the `create-react-app` command-line utility to initialize a React application can take some time. Therefore, to save time throughout this module, we will create one React application and only replace the `src` file for subsequent activities as we work on them.

To the react application, follow these steps:

  1. In the command line, navigate to `22-State/01-Activities`.

  2. Run the command `npx create-react-app 00-practice-app`.

  3. After `create-react-app` has completed (which can take a few minutes) and before each activity, copy the `src` folder from the activity and paste it into [00-practice-app](../00-practice-app/).

## Activity

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to consume data and values from a single, global source across my entire React application.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It is done when a global state object has been defined with the following properties: an array of students with `name` and `major` properties.

* It is done when the provider is made available to child components.

* It is done when the associated test suite passes with zero failures when `npm run test` is run.

## üí° Hints

When defining global state, which properties should be present? Should we care what type they are initialized with?

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* Can an app have multiple providers? If so, are they allowed to be nested?

Use [Google](https://google.com) or another search engine to research this.
