# 🏗️ Implement Global State with React Context API

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to consume data/values from a single, global source across my entire React application.

## Setup

Create a new React app called `00-practice-app` by running the following command:

```bash
npx create-react-app 00-practice-app
```

Copy the `src` directory from the `Unsolved` folder into `00-practice-app` before you begin.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when a global state object has been defined with the following properties: an array of students with `name` and `major` properties.

* It's done when the provider is made available to child components.

* It's done when the associated test suite passes with zero failures when `npm run test` is run.

## 💡 Hints

When defining global state, which properties should be present? Should we care what type they are initialized with?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* Can an app have multiple providers? If so, are they allowed to be nested?

Use [Google](https://google.com) or another search engine to research this.
