# 🐛 Reducer Fails to Add/Remove Students

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue(s):

* As a developer, I want to implement reducers into my application to update global state.

* As a developer, I want to be able to diagnose and fix the issue associated with the reducer that is causing the tests to fail.

## Setup

Copy the `src` directory from the unsolved folder into `00-practice-app` before you begin.
  
## Expected Behavior

When the tests are run, all of them should pass.

## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

1. Navigate to the `06-Stu-Reducers/Unsolved` folder and run `npm install`.

2. Run `npm run test`.

3. Note that the test fails.
