# 🐛 Client/Server Requests Not Working

Work with a partner to resolve the following issues:

* As a user, I want to be able to view pet data on the page by pressing a "Fetch Pets" button.

## Expected Behavior

When the user clicks the "Fetch Pets" button from the front end, each pet is rendered in a card on the screen.

## Actual Behavior

When a user requests the terms by clicking "Fetch Pets", nothing is rendered to the page and an error appears in the developer console.

## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

To reproduce the problem, follow these steps:

1. Open the page by visiting [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

2. Open the developer console by pressing Command+Option+K (macOS) or Ctrl+Shift+J (Windows).

3. Click "Fetch Pets", and note the lack of results on the page and the error in the developer console.
