# 📖 Implement Logging for GET and POST Requests

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to ensure that my requests are handled based on their HTTP method so that future create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations work as intended.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It is done when I have created a route that logs when a user has made a GET request.

* It is done when I have created a route that logs when a user has made a POST request.

* It is done when, if I test my route using Insomnia, GET and POST requests are logged.

## 💡 Hints

How can we enable the same endpoint to handle both GET and POST requests?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* When would you use a GET request vs. a POST request?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
