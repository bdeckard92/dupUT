# POST Requests

In this activity, you will create a POST route that adds new characters.

## Instructions

* Navigate to your [Unsolved](Unsolved/) folder and run `npm install`

* Open the [server.js](Unsolved/server.js) file.

* Create a POST route to `/api/characters` that adds new characters to the `characters` array. 

  * Log the new character in the console

  * Push the new character into the `characters` array

  * Send a response to the client in JSON format

* To check if a new character can be added correctly, use the Insomnia application to send a POST request to the server with a new character's data.
