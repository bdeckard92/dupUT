# 📐 Add Comments to Implementation of Client-Side POST Requests

Work with a partner to add comments that describe the functionality of the code found in [server.js](./Unsolved/server.js).

## 📝 Notes

Where does the information that we want to send to the server reside when we create the `fetch()` request?

Refer to the documentation:

[MDN Web Docs on using Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What other content types could you set when sending a request?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
