# 🏗️ Create an API Route

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to implement an API route that returns content from a JSON file, using an Express.js server.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It is done when I have imported Express.js into my project.

* It is done when I have created an `app` variable set to the value of `express()`.

* It is done when I have created an API endpoint to `/api/` that returns the contents of the `terms.json` file.

* It is done when GET requests made using the browser to the API endpoint return the content found in `terms.json`.
