# Express Routes

In this activity, you will create Express routes.

## Instructions

* Navigate to your [Unsolved](Unsolved/) folder and run `npm install`

* Open the [server.js](Unsolved/server.js) file.

* Create a data object for `obiwankenobi`.

  * Give the object `name`, `role`, `age`, and `forcePoints` properties of your choosing.
