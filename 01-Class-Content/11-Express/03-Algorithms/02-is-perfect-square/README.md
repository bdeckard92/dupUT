# Is Perfect Square

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that takes in a whole number, then returns `true` if the number is a [perfect square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_number) and otherwise returns `false`.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/is-perfect-square.js](Unsolved/is-perfect-square.js) in your code editor -- this is the only file you will modify in this activity.

  * In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `isPerfectSquare()` function to achieve the following:

    * If `num` is a [perfect square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_number), return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

      * A perfect square is a number that has a whole number as a square root.

    * See the following number for an example:

      ```js
      var num = 36; // Square root of 36 is 6
      ```

    * Given the preceding number, `true` should be returned.

    * See the following number for another example:

      ```js
      var num = 50; // Square root of 50 is 7.07106781187
      ```

    * Given the preceding number, `false` should be returned.

    * **Note**: Complete this problem without using the built-in `Math.sqrt()` method.

* You can check whether your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  * Functions that pass the tests will be denoted with a green check mark.

  * Functions that fail the tests will be denoted with a red X and an error message.

### Hints

If you aren't allowed to check the square root of the given number, can you check whether the [square of the number](http://www.math.com/school/subject1/lessons/S1U1L9GL.html) is the given number?
