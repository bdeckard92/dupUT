# Array Search 2D

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that takes in a 2-dimensional array and searches each 2D element for the character "X".

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/array-search-2d.js](Unsolved/array-search-2d.js) in your code editor -- **this is the only file you will modify in this activity.**

  * In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `arraySearch2D` function to achieve the following:

    * Return the total number of occurrences of the string "X" (capitalized) inside of the 2D array.

    * For example, given the following 2D array:

    ```js
    var arr = [
      ["X", "O", "O", "O", "X", "O"],
      ["O", "X", "O", "O", "O", "O"],
      ["O", "O", "O", "O", "X", "X"],
      ["O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O"]
    ]
    ```

    * The following number should be returned:

    ```js
    5
    ```

    * **Make sure you're looking for capital "X"**

* You can check to see if your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  * Functions that _pass_ the tests will be denoted with a **green check mark**.

  * Functions that _fail_ the tests will be denoted with a **red x and an error message**.
