# Array Search 2D

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that takes in a two-dimensional (2D) array and searches each 2D element for the character `X`.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/array-search-2d.js](Unsolved/array-search-2d.js) in your code editor -- this is the only file you will modify in this activity.

  * In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `arraySearch2D()` function to achieve the following:

    * Return the total number of occurrences of the string `"X"` (capitalized) inside the 2D array.

    * See the following 2D array for an example:

      ```js
      var arr = [
        ["X", "O", "O", "O", "X", "O"],
        ["O", "X", "O", "O", "O", "O"],
        ["O", "O", "O", "O", "X", "X"],
        ["O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O"]
      ]
      ```

    * Given the preceding array, the number `5` should be returned.

    * **Note**: Make sure you're looking for capital X.

* You can check whether your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  * Functions that pass the tests will be denoted with a green check mark.

  * Functions that fail the tests will be denoted with a red X and an error message.
