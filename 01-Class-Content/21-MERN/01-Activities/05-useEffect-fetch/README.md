# 📖 Use the `useEffect` Hook to make HTTP Calls

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to use the `useEffect` Hook to make HTTP calls to the Giphy API using `fetch` and a search term.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It is done when I use the `useEffect` to run the `handleSearchGiphy()` function with a search term of my choice as the argument.

* It is done when a GIF is displayed on the page when the page is loaded.

* It is done when I can search for another GIF and a new GIF is returned.

* It is done when the result of the GIF search replaces the GIF on the page.
