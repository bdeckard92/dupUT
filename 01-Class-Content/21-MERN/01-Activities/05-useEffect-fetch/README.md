# 📖 Use the `useEffect` Hook to make HTTP Calls

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to use the `useEffect` Hook to make HTTP calls using `fetch` and a search term to the Giphy API.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I use the `useEffect` to run the `handleSearchGiphy()` function with a search term of your choice as the argument.

* It's done when a GIF is displayed on the page when the page is loaded.

* It's done when I can search for another GIF and a new GIF is returned.

* It's done when the result of the GIF search replaces the GIF on the page.
