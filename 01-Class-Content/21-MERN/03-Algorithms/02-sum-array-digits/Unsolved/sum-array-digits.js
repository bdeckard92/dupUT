// Write a function that takes in two arrays of non-negative integers
// Each element in the arrays contains a single digit
// Together each array represents a whole number
// Create and return a new array that is the sum of the numbers of the two provided arrays
// Solve this problem without type coercion, ie don't join the array into a string
