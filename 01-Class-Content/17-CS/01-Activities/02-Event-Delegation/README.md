# Event Delegation

In this activity, you will use event delegation to listen for "clicks" on multiple items in order to add them to your shopping cart.

## Instructions

* Open [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) and examine the code. 

* Open [script.js](Unsolved/script.js) and do the following:

  * Create an event listener on the common parent element of the fruits. You can refer to `index.html` as needed.

  * When a button is clicked, create a `div` that will hold the name of the fruit and append it to the `#shopping-cart`.
  
## Hint(s)

* In order to get the name of the fruit, notice what unique identifier you can use from the `#grocery-list`.
