# 🐛 Binary Search Algorithm Not Passing Tests

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue:

* As a developer, I want to be able to find the position of a value in a data set by using a binary search function.

## Expected Behavior

When we run unit tests to test the binary search function, the defined tests pass.

## Actual Behavior

When we run unit tests to test the binary search function, the defined tests do not pass.

## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

1. In the command line, from the [Unsolved](./Unsolved) directory, run `npm install`.

2. Run `npm run test` to run the unit tests.

3. The tests defined in the `__tests__` directory do not pass.

## 💡 Hints

How can the unit test descriptions help us determine what the function is or is not doing?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What is worst possible Big-O complexity that an algorithm can have? What is the best?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
