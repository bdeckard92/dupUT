# Closures

In this activity, you will practice using closures and understanding scope.

## Instructions

* Navigate to [Unsolved](Unsolved/) in your command line and run `node index.js` and note what name is logged in the console.

* Open the [index.js](Unsolved/index.js) file.

* Create a closure inside the `person()` function called `displayName()`

* Invoke the `displayName()` in order to print "Lee" in the console.
