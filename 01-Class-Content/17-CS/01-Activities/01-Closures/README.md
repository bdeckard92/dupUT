# Closures

In this activity, you will practice using closures to gain a better understanding of scope. 

## Instructions

* Navigate to [Unsolved](Unsolved/) in your command line and run `node index.js` and note what name is logged in the console.

* Open the [index.js](Unsolved/index.js) file.

* Create a closure called `displayName()` that will access and print out the `name` variable in `person()` in the console.

* Invoke `displayName()` in order to print "Lee" in the console.
