# 📖 Create a Counter Function That Uses a Private Variable

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a teacher, I want a way to keep track of the number of students I see every day.

* As a developer, I want to keep my `count` variable data private.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It is done when the `counter` function correctly increments by 1.

* It is done when I can only access the `count` variable from within the `counter` function.

* It is done when I enter `npm install` and `npm test` in the terminal and all the tests pass.

## 📝 Notes
