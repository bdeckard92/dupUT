# Fibonacci

In this activity, you will actually implement the classic Fibonacci algorithm that you pseudocoded in Lesson 5. 

## Instructions

* Open the [index.js](Unsolved/index.js) file. 

* Choose between the linear OR recursive approach. Just choose ONE!

* Create a function that, when given a number, returns the value at that point in the sequence using the approach you chose.

  * Start at 1


## Bonus

* Navigate to the [Unsolved](Unsolved/) folder and run `npm install benchmark`
