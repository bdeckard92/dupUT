# Fibonacci

In this activity, you will actually implement the classic Fibonacci algorithm that you pseudocoded in Lesson 5. Remember that the Fibonacci sequence adds the previous two numbers to create the next number. 

## Instructions

* Open the [fibonacci.js](Unsolved/fibonacci.js) file. 

* Create a function that, when given a number, returns the value at that point in the sequence using the **linear approach**.

  * Start the sequence at 1.

* To check your code, run `node fibonacci.js` in your terminal and you should see `55` printed in the console.

## Bonus

* Benchmark your solution. 

  * Remember to run `npm install benchmark` in your `Unsolved/` folder. 
  
  * Create a `index.js` file and require `benchmark` along with your `linear` module from `fibonacci.js`.
