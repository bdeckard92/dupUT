# üèóÔ∏è Implement Regex to Validate a Username

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to find certain patterns of characters within a string to validate a username.

## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when the username can contain any lowercase letter between a-z.

  * It's done when the username can contain any number between 0-9.

  * It's done when the username can contain an underscore or hyphen.

  * It's done when the username can be between 3 - 16 characters long.

  * It's done when you use [RegExr](https://regexr.com/) to test out your regex.

## üí° Hints

* Use the "RegEx Reference" section on [RegExr](https://regexr.com/) to familiarize yourself with the patterns to make your regex.

* To test your regex using [RegExr](https://regexr.com/), do the following:

  * In the `Text` section, type a username that does fulfill the requirements, i.e. `janedoe_123`.

  * In the `Expression` section, test out your regex that will match that username. You will know your regex is correct if it shows a match.

  * You can also test it out by changing the `Text` to a username that does NOT follow the requirements, i.e. `JaneDoe_123`. Notice it will say "No match" if your regex is correct.

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How do you use special characters in regex to conduct a search that requires more than an exact match?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
