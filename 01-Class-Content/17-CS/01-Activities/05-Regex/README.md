# Regex

In this activity, you will write a regex (regular expression) to find certain patterns of characters within a string to validate a username. This activity will help you understand and practice using regex in order for you to succeed in this week's Challenge.

## Instructions

* Open the [regex.md](Unsolved/regex.md) file. 

* Create a regex that fulfills the following requirements for a username:

  * can contain any lowercase letter between a-z

  * can contain any number between 0-9

  * can contain an underscore or hyphen

  * is between 3 - 16 characters long

* You can use [RegExr](https://regexr.com/) to test out your regex.

  * In the `Text` section, type a username that does fulfill the requirements, i.e. `janedoe_123`.

  * In the `Expression` section, test out your regex that will match that username. You will know your regex is correct if it shows a match.

  * You can also test it out by changing the `Text` to a username that does NOT follow the requirements, i.e. `JaneDoe_123`. Notice it will say "No match" if your regex is correct.

## Hint(s)

* Use the "RegEx Reference" section on [RegExr](https://regexr.com/) to familiarize yourself with the patterns to make your regex.
