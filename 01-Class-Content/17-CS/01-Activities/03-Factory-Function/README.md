# Factory Function

In this activity, you will create a factory function that will print out the type, price, and origin of a beverage.

## Instructions

* Open the [index.js](Unsolved/index.js) file and do the following:

  * Create 3 variables for the `type`, `price`, and `origin` of the beverage and assign them to values of your choice.

  * Return an object literal which contains the methods `product`, `amount`, and `place`. 

    * `product()` will print an invitation to drink the `type` of beverage, i.e. "Would you like a coffee?"

    * `amount()` will print out the `price` of the beverage, i.e. "The price of this coffee is $6."

    * `place()` will print out the `origin` of the beverage, i.e. "This coffee is from Kenya!"

  * Invoke the methods in order to print out all of the messages in the console.
