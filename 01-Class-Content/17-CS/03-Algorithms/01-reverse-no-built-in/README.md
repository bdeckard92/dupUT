# Reverse Words

In this activity, you will write code to create a function that takes a given string and returns a new string with all of the characters in reverse order. You are not permitted to use the built-in `reverse` method.

## Instructions

1. Open [Unsolved/reverse-no-built-in.js](Unsolved/reverse-no-built-in.js) in your code editor **This is the only file you will modify in this activity.**

2. In this file, write code in the body of the `reverse` function that returns a new string that has all of the characters in the given string in reversed order.

   For example, given the following string:

   ```js
   const str = "just keep swimming";
   ```

   The following string should be returned:

   ```js
   "gnimmiws peek tsuj";
   ```

3. To check if your function works properly, open [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

   * Functions that pass the tests are denoted with a green checkmark.

   * Functions that fail the tests are denoted with a red x and an error message.
