# RPG Classes

In this activity, you will change the constructor function and prototype methods from the previous `RPG-Prototypes` activity into ES6 Classes. 

## Instructions

* Copy your code from [rpg-prototypes.js](../03-RPG-Prototypes/Unsolved/rpg-prototypes.js) and paste it into [rpg-classes.js](Unsolved/rpg-classes.js)

* Convert the constructor function, including the prototype methods, to ES6 Classes.

* Create two new instances of a `Character`, giving them different names, strength, and hitpoints. 

* Call a combination of `printStats()`, `attack()`, and `isAlive()` methods to have the two characters "fight" in your console.
