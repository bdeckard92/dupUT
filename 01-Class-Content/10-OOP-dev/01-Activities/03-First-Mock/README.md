# 🐛 Running npm run test Results in Errors

Work with a partner to resolve the following issues:

* As a developer, I want the tests for `dayCare.test.js` when I run `npm run test` in the console.

## Expected Behavior

* When we run `npm run test` in the console, we should not receive an error.

* When we run `npm run test` in the console, the tests for `dayCare.test.js` should be passing.

## Actual Behavior

* When we run `npm run test` in the console, we receive the following error: `"Cannot spyOn on a primitive value; undefined given"`.

* When we run `npm run test` in the console, the tests for `dayCare.test.js` are not passing.

## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

1. Navigate to the `Unsolved` folder in this activity.

2. Run `npm install` in your console.

3. Run `npm run test` in your console.

## 💡 Hints

What does the error tell you about what is missing, and how do we capture the value of `console.log`?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What are two or three other methods that can be used in conjunction with `spyOn`?

Use the [Jest API documentation on spyOn()](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/jest-object#jestspyonobject-methodname) to research this.
