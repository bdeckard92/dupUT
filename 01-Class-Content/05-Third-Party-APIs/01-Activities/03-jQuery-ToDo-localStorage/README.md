# jQuery To-do List with localStorage

In this activity you will build an interactive list application with persistent storage. 

## Instructions

From scratch, build a "To-do List" using jQuery with the following functionality:

* Items are added to the list through a form field. 

* Clicking the `Add item` button on the form sets the item in `localStorage`.

* Items in `localStorage` are rendered below the form field. 


## Bonus

* Add functionality to delete items.


## Hint(s)

* Don't forget to use `event.preventDefaul()` and `JSON.stringify()`.

* To delete items, you will need to use `this` and data attributes.
