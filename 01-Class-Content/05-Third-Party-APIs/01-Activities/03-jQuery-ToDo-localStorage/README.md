# jQuery To-do List with localStorage

In this activity you will add persistent storage to a "To-do list" application. 

## Instructions

Using the starter code in `/Unsolved`, ensure the following functionality:

* Items are added to the list through the form field. 

* Clicking the `Add item` button on the form sets the item in `localStorage`.

* Items in `localStorage` are rendered below the form field. 

* Items are removed from the DOM and `localStorage` when the "âœ“" button is clicked.


## Hint(s)

* You will need to create an array to hold list items.

* How do you check to see if items already exist in `localStorage`? If not, then what?

* You will need to selectively delete array elements using `.splice`.
