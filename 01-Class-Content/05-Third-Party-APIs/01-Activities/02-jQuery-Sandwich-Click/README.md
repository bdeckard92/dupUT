# jQuery Sandwich Click

In this activity, you will build an interactive application that tracks state and handles events.

## Instructions

* From scratch, create a simple jQuery application with the following functionality:

    * Renders three buttons, each referencing a different type of sandwich. 

    * When a button is clicked, a first alert displays a witty statement about the specific sandwich.
    
    * When the first alert is resolved, a second alert message displays the number of that specific sandwich the user has eaten.

## Hint(s)

You will need to use global variables to track state.

## BONUS

Render an image for each click event.
