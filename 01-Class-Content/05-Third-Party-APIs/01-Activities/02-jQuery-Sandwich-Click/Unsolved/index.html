    <h1>Click to Eat Sandwich</h1>

    <!-- BONUS: Render an image for each click event. You will need to declare an empty `<div>` with an id of `#image-div` for this -->

      // Create three global variables for tracking the number of sandwiches eaten
      //
      // YOUR CODE HERE
      //

      // Here we create various "on click" events which capture clicks
      // Inside each click event is the code to create an alert, update the counter, and show the updated count.
      // Take note that you can chain events onto an element
      // With this even if our ids are created at a later date our events will still always work
      //
      // YOUR CODE HERE
