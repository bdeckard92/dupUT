# 📖 Implement a Sortable List with Drag and Drop

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a user, I want to be able to sort my list of skills using the cursor to drag and drop them.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the list of skills can be reorganized and sorted using drag-and-drop functionality.

* It's done when a placeholder is filling empty space.

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the following documentation: 

[jQuery UI Demos](https://jqueryui.com/demos/)

## 💡 Hint

* Think about which interaction will allow a user to drag an element to a new spot on the list.

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner:

* Can we implement drag-and-drop functionality without jQuery? Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research how this works.
