# Max Num

In this activity, you will write code to create a function that returns the largest number in a given array.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/max-num.js](Unsolved/max-num.js) in your code editor; this is the only file you will modify in this activity.

* In this file, you will write code in the body of the `maxNum` function to function to achieve the following:

  * Return the largest number present in the given `arr` array.

    * For example, given the following array:

        ```js
        var arr = [3, 1, 17, 5, 6];
        ```

    * The following number should be returned:

        ```js
        17;
        ```

* You can check to see if your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  * Functions that pass the tests will be denoted with a green check mark.

  * Functions that fail the tests will be denoted with a red x and an error message.
