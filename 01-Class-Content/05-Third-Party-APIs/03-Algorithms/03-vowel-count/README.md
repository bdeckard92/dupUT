# Vowel Count

In this activity, you will write code to create a function that counts the number of vowels in a given string.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/vowel-count.js](Unsolved/vowel-count.js) in your code editor; this is the only file you will modify in this activity.

* In this file, you will write code in the body of the `vowelCount` function to achieve the following:

  * Return the number of vowels present in `str`.

* You can check to see if your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  * Functions that pass the tests will be denoted with a green check mark.

  * Functions that fail the tests will be denoted with a red x and an error message.
