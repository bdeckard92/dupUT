# Fizz Buzz

In this activity, you will write code to create a function that solves the [Fizz Buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) problem.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/fizz-buzz.js](Unsolved/fizz-buzz.js) in your code editor; this is the only file you will modify in this activity.

* In this file, you will write code in the body of the `fizzBuzz` function to achieve the following:

  * Iterate through each number in the given array.

  * If a number is evenly divisible by 3, print "Fizz" to the console.

  * If a number is evenly divisible by 5, print "Buzz" to the console.

  * If a number is evenly divisible by 3 and 5, print "Fizz Buzz" to the console.

  * Else print the number.

    * For example, given the following array:

        ```js
        var arr = [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20];
        ```

    * The following should be printed to the console:

        ```js
        13;
        14;
        ("Fizz Buzz");
        16
        17;
        ("Fizz");
        19;
        ("Buzz");
        ```

* You can check to see if your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  * Functions that pass the tests will be denoted with a green check mark.

  * Functions that fail the tests will be denoted with a red x and an error message.
