# Is Palindrome

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that takes in a string and determines whether or not it is a palindrome.

> A palindrome is defined as any string spelled the same forwards as it is backwards.

## Instructions

- Open [Unsolved/is-palindrome.js](Unsolved/is-palindrome.js) in your code editor -- **this is the only file you will modify in this activity.**

  - In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `isPalindrome` function to achieve the following:

    - Return `true` if the given string is a palindrome.

    - Return `false` if the given string is not a palindrome.

      - e.g. given the following string:

      ```js
      var str = "racecar";
      ```

      - The following should be returned:

      ```js
      true;
      ```

- You can check to see if your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  - Functions that _pass_ the tests will be denoted with a **green check mark**.

  - Functions that _fail_ the tests will be denoted with a **red x and an error message**.
