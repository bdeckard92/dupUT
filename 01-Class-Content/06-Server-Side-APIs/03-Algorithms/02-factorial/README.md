# Factorial

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function returns the [factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) of a given number.

## Instructions

- Open [Unsolved/factorial.js](Unsolved/factorial.js) in your code editor -- **this is the only file you will modify in this activity.**

  - In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `factorial` function to achieve the following:

    - Return the factorial of the given `num` integer.

    - A factorial of a number is the product of all of all positive integers less than or equal to the number.

    - e.g. given the following number:

    ```js
    var num = 3;
    ```

    - The following number should be returned:

    ```js
    6;
    // 1 x 2 x 3 === 6
    ```

    - If given `0`, the factorial should be `1`. Otherwise assume the given number will be a whole positive number.

- You can check to see if your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  - Functions that _pass_ the tests will be denoted with a **green check mark**.

  - Functions that _fail_ the tests will be denoted with a **red x and an error message**.
