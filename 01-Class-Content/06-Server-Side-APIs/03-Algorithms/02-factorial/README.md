# Factorial

In this activity, you will write code to create a function that returns the [factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) of a given number.

## Instructions

- Open [02-factorial/Unsolved/factorial.js](Unsolved/factorial.js) in your code editor; this is the only file you will modify in this activity.

  - In this file, you will write code in the body of the `factorial` function to achieve the following:

    - Return the factorial of the given `num` integer.

    - A factorial of a number is the product of all of all positive integers less than or equal to the number.

    - For example, given the following number:

      ```js
      var num = 3;
      ```

    - The following number should be returned:

      ```js
      6;
      // 1 x 2 x 3 === 6
      ```

    - If given `0`, the factorial should be `1`. Otherwise, assume the given number will be a whole positive number.

- You can check to see if your function works properly by opening [02-factorial/Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser:

  - Functions that pass the tests will be denoted with a green check mark.

  - Functions that fail the tests will be denoted with a red x and an error message.
