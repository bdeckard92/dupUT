# 🏗️ Implement a fetch() Request to Display User Repositories

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a user, I want to see a list of my GitHub repositories.

## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when I click the "Fetch Your User Repos" button, and a list of my GitHub repositories displays on the page.

## Assets

The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

## 💡 Hints

* How can we use the [GitHub API documentation on repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#list-repositories-for-a-user) to support this implementation?

* Where in the URL string is the repository endpoint added?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* In `fetch()` requests we use the URL. What is the difference between a URL and URI? 

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
