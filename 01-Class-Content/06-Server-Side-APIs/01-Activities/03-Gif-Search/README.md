# GIF Search

In this activity, you will call Giphy's search API with a search term entered by the user. 

## Instructions

* Open the [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) file and examine the ID's of the HTML elements. This will be important for DOM manipulation later.

* Open the [script.js](Unsolved/assets/js/script.js) file and do the following:

  * Create a function called `myFunction()`

  * Create a variable that will capture the value of the user's input

  * Make a `fetch` request using the user's input. Remember to add your API key at the end.

  * Create a variable that selects the `<div>` where the GIF will be displayed

  * Empty out the `<div>` of any previous GIFs

  * Append the GIF to the page

## Hint(s)

* Detailed instructions are in the `script.js` file as comments.

* You may need to refer to the [Giphy API endpoint docs](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/endpoint#search).
