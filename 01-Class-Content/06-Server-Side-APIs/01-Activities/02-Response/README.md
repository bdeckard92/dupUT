# Display Response

In this activity you will use the fetch you created in the last activity and then instead of console logging the response, display a gif to the page!

## Instructions

* Open `index.html` and check the IDs and class names of the HTML elements, this will be important for DOM manipulation later.

* Open `script.js` and create a new fetch request to the Giphy API `random` endpoint.

* From the response, display a gif to the screen.

## Hint(s) 

* We will need to use DOM manipulation to create elements and append them to the screen!

* Check out the `<img>` tag.
