# Display Response

In this activity, you will create a fetch request and instead of logging the response in the console, you will display the GIF from the response in the browser.

## Instructions

* Open the [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) file and examine the ID's and class names of the HTML elements. This will be important for DOM manipulation later.

* Open the [script.js](Unsolved/assets/js/script.js) file and create a fetch request to the Giphy API `random` endpoint.

  * Remember to include your API key!

* Display the GIF in the browser using the appropriate DOM manipulation.

## Hint(s) 

* Check out the `<img>` tag.
