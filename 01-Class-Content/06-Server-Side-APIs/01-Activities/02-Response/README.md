# Display Response

In this activity, you will take the response from the fetch request and  display the GIF in the browser.

## Instructions

* Open the [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) file and examine the ID's and class names of the HTML elements. This will be important for DOM manipulation later.

* Open the [script.js](Unsolved/assets/js/script.js) file and follow the directions in the comments to display the GIF on the page.

  * Use DOM manipulation to create HTML elements and append them to the page. 

## Hint(s)

* You can refer to the [DOM Docs on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents)
