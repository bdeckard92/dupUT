# 📖 Implement a `fetch()` Request to Log Repository Issues

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to log issues from Twitter's Chill repository.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It is done when I open Chrome DevTools, and five issues from the Chill repository are logged in the console.

* It is done when the issue's URL and username are logged in the DevTools console.

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation:

[GitHub API documentation on listing repository issues](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/issues#list-repository-issues)

---

## 💡 Hints

* How do you add parameters to an API endpoint URL?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* We connect to these API servers through DNS, but they are attached to an IP address. How does this work?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
