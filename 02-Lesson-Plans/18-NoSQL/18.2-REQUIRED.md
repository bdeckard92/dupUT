# Module 18 Virtual Class (Required): NoSQL

## Overview 

In today's required virtual class, students will use Mongoose to create schemas, perform CRUD operations, and utilize the `.populate()` method.


## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Create schema using Mongoose

* Create routes to create, read, update, and delete data using Mongoose

* Utilize the `.populate()` method


## Instructor Notes 

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* This last phase of the boot camp is more about being employer-ready, improving the skills they have already learned, and making their web applications more performant and efficient. Basically, students will focus on "Life after Boot Camp". 

* These activities will use Insomnia Core instead of relying on a front end. 

* The `04-Mongoose-CRUD` activity might take longer than the allocated 15 minutes, so the time has been adjusted between that activity and the `05-Mongoose-Populate` activity. 

* Mongoose schemas, CRUD operations, and `.populate()` are covered throughout Lessons 1 and 2. Validations for the schema are in Lesson 5. 


## Office Hours

Encourage students to work on the remaining module algorithms during Office Hours. Review the algorithm solutions 5–10 minutes before class begins or during Office Hours after class.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What did you learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

    * 🙋 We learned about NoSQL databases, mainly MongoDB, and the Mongoose ODM. We are moving fast compared to traditional learners. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ Did anyone have an "Aha!" or "Eureka!" moment this week? When was it and why did things suddenly click for you? 

    * 🙋 Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we're thinking about it.

    * ☝️ Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

    * 🙋 It's easy to get stuck when you're learning web development. It's important to learn how to get unstuck because it happens to the pros too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the tool's official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups are great because explaining your problems to someone else often reveals the solution. 


### 2. Review Current Challenge (5 min)

* Navigate to `02-Challenge/Master` from the command line and run `npm start`.

* Open Insomnia Core and demonstrate the following:

    * We are building an API for a social network using MongoDB and Mongoose. We have users with thoughts. We can add and remove reactions to thoughts. We can also add and remove friends from the user's friend list. 

    * We can make GET requests to return all users and all thoughts, or a single user and single thought.

    * We can make POST, PUT, DELETE requests for users and thoughts.

    * We can make POST and DELETE requests for friends and reactions.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What recently acquired skills will help us build this challenge?

    * 🙋 MongoDB is our NoSQL database and Mongoose is our ODM (Object Document Mapper).

    * ☝️ How are these skills relevant to a career in web development?

    * 🙋 NoSQL databases are becoming very popular these days with the wide use of JavaScript. Knowing how to use both SQL and NoSQL database will make you an even stronger full-stack developer.

    * ☝️ How will this challenge improve your portfolio?

    * 🙋 It will show employers your ability to utilize NoSQL databases and ODMs. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 3. Instructor Demo: Mongoose Schema (5 min) 

* Navigate to `03-Mongoose-Schema/Solved` in your command line and run `npm start` to start the server.

* Open Insomnia Core to demonstrate the following: 

    * 🔑 We will make a POST request to `http://localhost:3001/submit` with the following data for a new user in JSON format:

    ```js
    {
        "username": "janedoe",
        "password": "Password123",
        "email": "janedoe@email.com"
    }
    ```

    * 🔑 We see a new user was created in our database collection.

    * 🔑 But if we try to create a user without a username or if the password is too short, we will get an error message.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We created schemas for the Pizza model in Lesson 1. Then we added validations to it in Lesson 5.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We will be using MongoDB for the challenge, so we will need to create Mongoose schemas for all of the models used in the challenge.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We will need to add four attributes to the user schema along with validations.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 4. Student Do: Mongoose Schema  (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `03-Mongoose-Schema/README.md`.

```md
# Mongoose Schema

In this activity, you will create a user schema with Mongoose.

## Instructions

* Open [user-model.js](Unsolved/user-model.js) and add the following four attributes to your schema:

  * `username`: A string that will be trimmed and required with a custom error message, i.e. 'Username is Required'. 

  * `password`: A string that will be trimmed, required with a custom error message, and at least 6 characters.

  * `email`: A string that must be a valid email address and unique in our collection.

  * `userCreated`: A date that will default to the current date.

* To test it out, run `npm install` and `npm start` in your command line to start the server.

  * Open Insomnia and make a POST request to `/submit` with data for a new user in JSON format, i.e.

  {
    "username": "janedoe",
    "password": "Password123",
    "email": "janedoe@email.com"
  }

  * You should see your new user created in the data returned from our POST request. 

## Hint(s)

* To check if an email address is valid, you can use `match` to create a validator that checks if the value matches the given regex, which for checking if a string is an email is: `/.+\@.+\..+/`.

* You can refer to the Mongoose docs on [Validations](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/validation.html) or on [String Validators](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/schematypes.html#string-validators).

## Bonus 

* Insert five more documents with one command. Use the [MongoDB Manual on Query Documents](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/query-documents/) to see how you can accomplish this.
```


### 5. Instructor Review: Mongoose Schema  (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ `username` and validations

    * ✔️ `password` and validations

    * ✔️ `email` and validations

    * ✔️ `userCreated`

* Open `03-Mongoose-Schema/Solved/user-model.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * Notice we imported our dependencies on top. We only needed the `Schema` constructor and `model` function from Mongoose. 

    ```js
    const { Schema, model } = require('mongoose');
    ```

    * 🔑 For `username`, we specify the type as a `String`, we want it to be trimmed with no white spaces, and we want it to be required with a custom error message.

    ```js
    username: {
        type: String,
        trim: true,
        required: 'Username is Required'
    },
    ```

    * 🔑 For `password`, we specify the type as a `String`, we want it to be trimmed with no white spaces, and we want it to be required with a custom error message. We also want it to be longer than 6 characters.

    ```js
    password: {
        type: String,
        trim: true,
        required: 'Password is Required',
        minlength: 6
    },
    ```

    * 🔑 For `email`, we specify the type as a `String`, we want to make sure it doesn't already exist in our database collection, and we want to check if it is a valid email address. To do this, we need to use regex!

    ```js
    email: {
        type: String,
        unique: true,
        match: [/.+@.+\..+/]
    },
    ```

    * 🔑 Finally for `userCreated`, we specify the type as a `Date` and we set the default date to the current date.

    ```js
    userCreated: {
        type: Date,
        default: Date.now
    }
    ```

    * If you attempted the bonus @TODO

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What are the benefits of using Mongoose?

    * 🙋 It allows us to create a schema, enforce validations and overall make it easier to interface with a MongoDB database.

    * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to the lesson plan, read the Mongoose docs on [Validations](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/validation.html) or on [String Validators](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/schematypes.html#string-validators), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 6. Instructor Demo: Mongoose CRUD  (5 min) 

* Navigate to `04-Mongoose-CRUD/Solved` in your command line and run `npm start` to start the server.

* Open Insomnia Core to demonstrate the following: 

    * 🔑 We can make a POST request to `http://localhost:3001/submit` with the following data for a new note in JSON format:

    ```js
    {
        "title": "Post 1",
        "note": "Here is Post 1."
    }
    ```

    * 🔑 We see a new note was created in our database collection.

    * 🔑 We can make a GET request to `http://localhost:3001/all` to see the notes in our collection.

    * 🔑 We can make a POST request to `http://localhost:3001/update/:id` using the `_id` of the note we want to update. 

    * 🔑 We can make a DELETE request to `http://localhost:3001/delete/:id` using the `_id` of the note we want to delete. 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We utilized the CRUD operations in the `pizzaController` in Lesson 1.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We will use CRUD operations for the Users and Thoughts in the challenge.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We will need to modify the 4 routes in `server.js` to create, retrieve, update and delete the notes.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 7. Student Do: Mongoose CRUD  (20 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* **Note** the allocated time for this activity and the next has been switched. Students will be given 20 minutes to finish this activity, and 15 minutes to complete the next activity. 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Mongoose-CRUD/README.md`.

```md
# Mongoose CRUD

In this activity, you will create, update, and delete notes from the database using Mongoose. 

## Instructions

* Open [note-model.js](Unsolved/note-model.js) to see the Note schema.

* Open [server.js](Unsolved/server.js) and modify the following routes:

  * In the POST route to `/submit`, create a new note in the database's collection.

  * In the GET route to `/all`, retrieve all notes in the collection.

  * In the POST route to `/update/:id`, update one note by its ObjectId, `_id`.

  * In the DELETE route to `/delete/:id`, delete one note by its ObjectId, `_id`.

* To test it out, run `npm install` and `npm start` in your command line to start the server.

  * Open Insomnia and make a POST request to `/submit` with data for a new note in JSON format, i.e. 

  {
    "title": "Post 1",
    "note": "Here is Post 1."
  }

  * Now make a GET request to `/all`, POST request to `/update/:id`, and DELETE request to `/delete/:id` to check the rest of your routes.

## Hint(s)

* You can refer to the Mongoose docs on [queries](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/queries.html).
