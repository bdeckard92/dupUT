# Module 18 Virtual Class (Recommended): NoSQL

## Overview

In today's recommended virtual class, students will practice using Mongoose virtuals and subdocuments, as well as solve a new algorithm in CodeSignal.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Solve the CodeSignal algorithm `rotateMatrix180`

* Add virtual properties to MongoDB documents

* Add subdocument arrays to MongoDB documents

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* Today's activities will use Insomnia Core instead of relying on a front end. 

* Mongoose virtuals were introduced in Lesson 2, and subdocuments were used in Lesson 3.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (5 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Direct students to post individual questions in the Zoom chat to be addressed by TAs and/or at the end of class.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How are you feeling about your progress so far?

  * üôã We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back and see what we accomplished, and acknowledge that it's a lot! It‚Äôs also okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don‚Äôt give up.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with this topic?

  * üôã Let's do "fist to five" together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 2. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* [Click here for CodeSignal challenge](https://app.codesignal.com/public-test/6jwJHxzFJt5mDLF5q/WdKQbxwWAJYMnA) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Did anyone attempt the Code Signal algorithm?

  * üôã It is encouraged to take advantage of the CodeSignal practice because it reflects real-world technical interviewing.

* Open your IDE and review the solution to the Code Signal algorithm:

  * The algorithm is called `rotateMatrix180`. We are given a matrix of integers `m`, and we are asked to rotate it by 180 degrees.

  * This algorithm is tough. Let students know it's totally okay if they didn't get this one.

  * For 
  ```js
  m = [[1, 2, 3, 4],
      [5, 6, 7, 8]]
  ```

  the output would be:
  
  ```js
  rotateMatrix180(m) = [[8, 7, 6, 5],
                      [4, 3, 2, 1]]
  ```

  * The instructions provide the following details regarding input and output:

  ```md
  [execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)

  [input] array.array.integer m

  Guaranteed constraints:
  0 ‚â§ m.length ‚â§ 1000,
  0 ‚â§ m[i].length ‚â§ 1000,
  m[i].length = m[j].length,
  -1000 ‚â§ m[i][j] ‚â§ 1000.

  [output] array.array.integer

  Return m rotated by 180 degrees.
  ```

  * We are also provided the following starter code:

  ```js
  function rotateMatrix180(m) {

  }
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òù) and call on students for answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è So, knowing that this is a complicated one, what is the first step you might take?

  * üôã Pseudocode it! Walk through the steps, in plain English, that you'll need to take.

* Allow students to share pseudocode they have if they took this step. If they didn't take this step, give them 5 minutes to try and pseudocode it now.

* For this algorithm, this might be all they manage. And that's totally fine! Remind students that oftentimes pseudocode is all that we need in an interview. 
    
  * ‚òù Would anybody like to share their pseudocode?

  * üôã Here is one possible solution:
    
  ```md
  - get the total length of the matrix and assign it to a new variable
  - if the length of the matrix is 0, we can just return i
  - or if the length of the matrix is 1, we can just reverse it and return it
  - now lets grab the length of the first array inside the matrix and assign this to a new variable
  - we are going to run our loop with the condition of as long as i is less than half of the total length of the matrix
  - inside of this for loop, execute a regular for loop
  - get a temporary variable and rotate the arrays by substracting 1 from each item and then reassigning
  - finally, return m
  ```

  * ‚òù Commend students on the various solutions they come up with. You'll likely see a variety of solutions. Time permitting, share the coded solution below along with any directions.

* Full solution:

```js
function rotateMatrix180(m) {

 // get the total length of the matrix and assign it to a new variable
 const matrixLength = m.length;

  // if the length of the matrix is 0, we can just return `m`
  if (matrixLength == 0) {
      return m;

  // or if the length of the matrix is 1, we can just reverse it and return it
  } else if (matrixLength == 1) {
      m[0].reverse();
      return m;
  }

  // now let's grab the length of the first array inside the matrix and assign this to a new variable
  const firstItemInMatrix = m[0].length;

  // we are going to run our loop with the condition of as long as `i` is less than half of the total length of the matrix
  for (let i = 0; i < Math.floor(matrixLength / 2); i++) {

    // inside of this `for` loop, execute a regular `for` loop
    for (let j = 0; j < firstItemInMatrix; j++) {

      // get a temporary variable and rotate the arrays by subtracting 1 from each item and then reassigning
      let tmp = m[i][j];
      m[i][j] = m[matrixLength - i - 1][firstItemInMatrix - j - 1];
      m[matrixLength - i - 1][firstItemInMatrix - j - 1] = tmp;
    }
  }

  // finally, return m
  return m;
}
```

* Answer any questions before moving on to the next section.


### 3. Instructor Demo: Mongoose Virtuals (5 min)

* Navigate to `01-Mongoose-Virtuals/Solved/` in your command line and run `npm start`.

* Open Insomnia Core and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë When we make a POST request to `http://localhost:3001/submit` we format the data for a new user in JSON:

  ```js
  {
    "firstName": "Jane",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "password": "Password123",
    "email": "janedoe@email.com"
  }
  ```

  * üîë The response we get back includes a `username` field, which is the first part of the email address. That's the virtual property.

  * üîë If we make a few more users and then make a GET request to `/users` in Insomnia, we can see all of the users in the database with `username` as a virtual property.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Where have we used this before?

  * üôã We added a virtual property `commentCount` to the `PizzaSchema` in Lesson 2.
  
  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  * üôã We will need to add virtual properties to the `Thought` and `User` models.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?

  * üôã We can create a virtual property that will grab the first part of the email address.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Mongoose Virtuals (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-Mongoose-Virtuals/README.md`.

```md
# Mongoose Virtuals

In this activity, you will use Mongoose virtuals to add a property to a user that won't be stored in the database.

## Instructions

* Open [User.js](Unsolved/models/User.js) and do the following:

  * Create a virtual property named `username` that will be taken from the front part of the email address (before the `@` symbol)

  * Remember to set the `toJSON` schema option to use virtuals and set the `id` to false since we don't need it for virtuals.

* To test it out, run `npm start` in your command line to start the server.

* Open Insomnia Core and make a POST request to `/submit` with data for a new user in JSON format.

  * You should see the response in JSON that includes a `username` virtual property.

  * If you make a few more users and then make a GET request to `/users` in Insomnia Core, you should see all of the users in the database with `username` as a virtual property.

## Hint(s)

* You can use `slice()` or `split()` to get the front part of the email address.
```

### 5. Instructor Review: Mongoose Virtuals (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `.virtual()`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `.slice()` or `.split()`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `toJSON`

* Open `01-Mongoose-Virtuals/Solved/models/User.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * üîë First we need to create a virtual property called `username` for the `UserSchema`.

  ```js
  UserSchema.virtual('username').get(function() {
  });
  ```

  * üîë We can use `.slice()` or `.split()` to get the first part of the email address to use for our `username`. Here is how you could do it with `.slice()`.

  ```js
  return this.email.slice(0, this.email.indexOf('@'));
  ```

  * üîë Finally in the `UserSchema` we need to add a `toJSON` schema option that sets `virtuals` to `true` and `id` to `false`

  ```js
  {
    toJSON: {
      virtuals: true
    },
    id: false
  }
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What is the benefit of using virtual properties?

  * üôã Virtuals allow us to add more information to a database response so that we don't have to add in the information manually with a helper before responding to the API request.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to Lesson 2, read the [Mongoose Docs on Virtuals](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/tutorials/virtuals.html), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Subdocuments (5 min)

* Navigate to `02-Subdocuments/Solved` in your command line and run `npm start` to start the server.

* Open Insomnia Core and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë When we make a POST request to `http://localhost:3001/api/notebooks` with data for a new notebook in JSON format, a new notebook is created:

  ```js
  {
    "title": "Notebook 1"
  }
  ```

  * üîë Using the `_id` of the notebook we just created, we can make a POST request to `http://localhost:3001/api/notebooks/:notebookId/notes` with data for a new note in JSON format:

  ```js
  {
    "noteText": "Here is Note 1"
  }
  ```

  * In the response we get back, we can see the notebook with the note as a subdocument.

  * üîë Using the `noteId` of the note we just created, we can make a DELETE request to `http://localhost:3001/api/notebooks/:notebookId/notes/:noteId`. You should see the note deleted from the notebook.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Where have we used this before?

  * üôã We created replies as a subdocument array for comments in Lesson 3. 

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  * üôã We will need to use subdocuments to add reactions to thoughts in the challenge.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?

  * üôã We need to create a `noteSchema` to be used by the notebook. We also need to create a POST route and DELETE route to create and delete a note from the notebook. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Subdocuments (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Subdocuments/README.md`.

```md
# Subdocuments

In this activity, you will create notes as a subdocument array for notebooks.

## Instructions

* Open [Notebook.js](Unsolved/models/Notebook.js) to see the notebook schema and how it is including the notes.

* In the [models/](Unsolved/models/) folder, create a `Note.js` file and create the `noteSchema`.

  * Import `Schema` and `Types` from Mongoose.

  * The `noteSchema` should include a `noteId` field that defaults to `new Types.ObjectId()` and a `noteText` field which is a required `String`.

  * Be sure to export `noteSchema`.

* Open [server.js](Unsolved/server.js) and modify the following routes:

  * Modify the POST route to `/api/notebooks/:notebookId/notes` to create a new note for a notebook. 

  * Modify the DELETE route to `/api/notebooks/:notebookId/notes/:noteId` to delete a note from a notebook.

* To test it out, run `npm start` in your command line to start the server.

* Open Insomnia Core and make a POST request to `/api/notebooks` with data for a new notebook in JSON format.

  * Using the `_id` of the notebook, make a POST request to `/api/notebooks/:notebookId/notes` with data for a new note in JSON format.

  * Using the `noteId` of the note, make a DELETE request to `/api/notebooks/:notebookId/notes/:noteId`.

  ## Hint(s)

  * Remember to include `{ runValidators: true, new: true }` when querying the `Notebook` to ensure that the values in `req` adhere to the `noteSchema` in your notebook. 

  * If there is no notebook data returned, then return a 404 status with an error message.

  * If there are any errors, catch them and log them into the console as well as return a 500 status.
```

### 8. Instructor Review: Subdocuments (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `noteSchema`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `$addToSet`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `$pull`

* Open `02-Subdocuments/Solved/models/Notebook.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We are requiring the `noteSchema` on top, and notice how we have included it in the `notebookSchema` as a subdocument array.

  ```js
  const noteSchema = require('./Note');

  notes: [noteSchema]
  ```

* Open `02-Subdocuments/Solved/models/Note.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We bring in `Schema` and `Types` from Mongoose. 

  ```js
  const { Schema, Types } = require('mongoose');
  ```

  * üîë We set up the `noteSchema` with a `noteId` field and a `noteText` field.

  ```js
  const noteSchema = new Schema({
    noteId: {
      type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      default: () => new Types.ObjectId(),
    },

    noteText: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
    },
  });
  ```

  * Finally we export the `noteSchema`

  ```js
  module.exports = noteSchema;
  ```

* Open `02-Subdocuments/Solved/server.js` in your IDE and explain the following:
  
  * Notice we are only bringing in the `Notebook`. `Note` is a subdocument of `Notebook`!

  ```js
  const { Notebook } = require('./models');
  ```

  * To create a new note for a notebook, we make a POST request to `/api/notebooks/:notebookId/notes`. 
  
    * We query the `Notebook` collection to find the specific `notebook` that the note is being created for using `findOneAndUpdate()`.

    * üîë Then we use `$addToSet` to create a new note and push it into the `notes` subdocument array.

    * We include `{ runValidators: true, new: true }` to ensure that the values in `req` adhere to the `noteSchema` in the notebook.

    ```js
    app.post('/api/notebooks/:notebookId/notes', (req, res) => {
      Notebook.findOneAndUpdate(
        { _id: req.params.notebookId },
        { $addToSet: { notes: req.body } },
        { runValidators: true, new: true }
      )
    ```

    * If there is no notebook data returned, then we return a 404 status with an error message.

    ```js
    .then(dbNotebookData => {
      if (!dbNotebookData) {
        return res.status(404).json({ message: 'No notebook with this id!' });
      }
      res.json(dbNotebookData);
    })
    ```

    * If there are any errors, we catch them and log them into the console as well as return a 500 status.

    ```js
    .catch(err => {
      console.log(err);
      res.status(500).json(err);
    });
    ```

  * In order to delete the note, we make a DELETE request to `/api/notebooks/:notebookId/notes/:noteId`.

    * We query the `Notebook` collection to find the specific `notebook` that has the `note` we are trying to delete using the `notebookId` and `noteId` in the params.

    * üîë Then we use `$pull` to pull the note from the subdocument array.

    * Again we include the `runValidators`

    ```js
    app.delete('/api/notebooks/:notebookId/notes/:noteId', (req, res) => {
      Notebook.findOneAndUpdate(
        { _id: req.params.notebookId },
        { $pull: { notes: { noteId: req.params.noteId } } },
        { runValidators: true, new: true }
      )
    ```

    * If there is no notebook data returned, then we return a 404 status with an error message. If there are any errors, we catch them and log them into the console as well as return a 500 status.

    ```js
    .then(dbNotebookData => {
      if (!dbNotebookData) {
        return res.status(404).json({ message: 'No notebook with this id!' });
      }
      res.json(dbNotebookData);
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.log(err);
      res.status(500).json(err);
    });
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What are the similarities and differences between subdocuments and individual documents?

  * üôã Like normal documents, subdocuments can have middleware, custom validation logic, and virtuals. However unlike normal documents, they cannot be saved separately and are only saved whenever their top-level parent document gets saved. 

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to Lesson 3 read the [Mongoose Docs on Subdocuments](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/subdocs.html), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 09. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

  * üôã We covered Mongoose virtuals and subdocuments.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

  * üôã All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

  * üôã It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

  * üôã We covered virtuals in Lesson 2 and subdocuments in Lesson 3.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Use student answers to transition to Office Hours.

### 10. Office Hours (30 min)

* Announce Office Hours and invite students to stay on the Zoom and start the challenge while they have live support from instructional staff.

### 11. End
