## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (5 min)

- Welcome students to class.

- Direct students to post individual questions in the Zoom chat to be addressed by TAs and/or at the end of class.

- Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  - ‚òùÔ∏è How are you feeling about your progress so far?

  - üôã We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back and see what we accomplished, and acknowledge that it's a lot! It‚Äôs also okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don‚Äôt give up.

  - ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with this topic?

  - üôã Let's do "fist to five" together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 2. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* [Click here for CodeSignal challenge](https://app.codesignal.com/public-test/6jwJHxzFJt5mDLF5q/WdKQbxwWAJYMnA) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è Did anyone attempt the Code Signal algorithm?

    * üôã It is encouraged to take advantage of the CodeSignal practice because it reflects real-world online interviewing.

* Open your IDE and review the solution to the Code Signal algorithm:

    * The algorithm is called `rotateMatrix180`. We are given a matrix of integers `m`, and we are asked to rotate it by 180 degrees.

    * This algorithm is tough. Let students know it's totally okay if they didn't get this one.

    * For 
    ```js
    m = [[1, 2, 3, 4],
        [5, 6, 7, 8]]
    ```

    the output would be:
    
    ```js
    rotateMatrix180(m) = [[8, 7, 6, 5],
                      [4, 3, 2, 1]]
    ```

    * The instructions provide the following details regarding input and output:

    ```md
    [execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)

    [input] array.array.integer m

    Guaranteed constraints:
    0 ‚â§ m.length ‚â§ 1000,
    0 ‚â§ m[i].length ‚â§ 1000,
    m[i].length = m[j].length,
    -1000 ‚â§ m[i][j] ‚â§ 1000.

    [output] array.array.integer

    Return m rotated by 180 degrees.
    ```

    * We are also provided the following starter code:

    ```js
    function rotateMatrix180(m) {

    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òù) and call on students for answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è So, knowing that this is a complicated one, what is the first step you might take?

    * üôã Pseudocode it! Walk through the steps, in plain English, that you'll need to take.

* Allow students to share pseudocode they have if they took this step. If they didn't take this step, give them 5 minutes to try and pseudocode it now.

* For this algorithm, this might be all they manage. And that's totally fine! Remind students that oftentimes pseudocode is all that we need in an interview. 
    
    * ‚òù Would anybody like to share their pseudocode?

    * üôã Here is one possible solution:
      
    ```md
    - get the total length of the matrix and assign it to a new variable
    - if the length of the matrix is 0, we can just return i
    - or if the length of the matrix is 1, we can just reverse it and return it
    - now lets grab the length of the first array inside the matrix and assign this to a new variable
    - we are going to run our loop with the condition of as long as i is less than half of the total length of the matrix
    - inside of this for loop, execute a regular for loop
    - get a temporary variable and rotate the arrays by substracting 1 from each item and then reassigning
    - finally, return m
    ```

    * ‚òù Commend students on the various solutions they come up with. You'll likely see a variety of solutions. Time permitting, share the coded solution below along with any directions.

* Answer any questions before moving on to the next solution.

* Full solution:

```js
function rotateMatrix180(m) {

 // get the total length of the matrix and assign it to a new variable
 const matrixLength = m.length;

    // if the length of the matrix is 0, we can just return i
    if (matrixLength== 0) {
        return m;

        // or if the length of the matrix is 1, we can just reverse it and return it
    } else if (matrixLength == 1) {
        m[0].reverse();
        return m;
    }

    // now lets grab the length of the first array inside the matrix and assign this to a new variable
    const firstItemInMatrix = m[0].length;

    // we are going to run our loop with the condition of as long as i is less than half of the total length of the matrix
    for (let i = 0; i < Math.floor(matrixLength / 2); i++) {

        // inside of this for loop, execute a regular for loop
        for (let j = 0; j < firstItemInMatrix; j++) {

            // get a temporary variable and rotate the arrays by subtracting 1 from each item and then reassigning
        	let tmp = m[i][j];
        	m[i][j] = m[matrixLength - i - 1][firstItemInMatrix - j - 1];
        	m[matrixLength - i - 1][firstItemInMatrix - j - 1] = tmp;
        }
    }

    // finally, return m
    return m;
}
```

The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

  - ‚òùÔ∏è Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

  - üôã @TODO { YES, WHERE? }

  - ‚òùÔ∏è What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

- Use student answers to transition to Office Hours.
