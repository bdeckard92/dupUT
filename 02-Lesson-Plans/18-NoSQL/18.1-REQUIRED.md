# Module 18 Virtual Class: NoSQL

## Overview

In today's virtual class, students will practice using Mongoose virtuals and subdocuments.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Add virtual properties to MongoDB documents

* Add subdocument arrays to MongoDB documents

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* Today's activities will use Insomnia Core instead of relying on a front end. 

* Mongoose virtuals were introduced in Lesson 2, and subdocuments were used in Lesson 3.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Invite students to post questions in the Zoom chat so TAs and/or the instructor can address them at the end of class.

* Open the lesson's [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1y8Z6ffuf0Mi19429yoiazF3dBP6U3f3FOuajE8inIMg/edit?usp=sharing) and walk through the following slides on foundation setting:

  **Big Picture**: This is an opportunity to look at the big picture of where students are in the course. Take a moment to discuss a few real-world examples of why this week's topics are valuable.
   
  **Boot Camp Pointers**: Review some logistics that will help students stay on track. This is an opportunity to speak to what students might need at this particular point in the course.
   
  **This Week**: Review the key skills students will be learning this week. 

  **This Week's Assignment**: Give a quick summary of this week's Challenge assignment and describe how the skills they learn throughout the week will be applied to it.
   
  **Career Connection**: Reinforce that students will use the skills they learn this week throughout their careers. It's important for them to know the "why" and "how" behind the "what." Give examples of how these skills are used on the job. If you feel comfortable, share examples of how you have used them in your professional career.

  * Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Why should we bother learning how to implement and use NoSQL databases such as MongoDB when SQL is so prevalent in the developer community?

    * 🙋 It's free to use and readily available. It is also backed by a robust developer community. MongoDB is very easy to set up in comparison to a SQL database, and many application drafts and proof-of-concepts are spun up using MongoDB because it is quick to do so. 

  * Let students know that even though NoSQL databases aren't quite as popular as SQL databases, they are rising in popularity and are frequently used with social media platforms. Understanding how to use both SQl and NoSQL in application development helps make you more marketable to employers.

  **How to Succeed This Week**: Remind students that they might experience moments of frustration as they learn complex concepts and tools, and that these times are actually proven opportunities to deepen knowledge. Consider sharing something about your personal learning journey. This helps students recognize that everyone starts somewhere and that they are not alone.

  **Today's Objectives**: Outline the concepts that will be covered in today's lesson. Remind students that they can find the relevant activity files in the "Getting Ready for Class" page in their course content.

### 2. Instructor Do: Student Check-In (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

  * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back at what we accomplished and acknowledge that it's a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic?

  * 🙋 Let's do Fist to Five together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 3. Instructor Demo: Mongoose Virtuals (5 min)

* Navigate to `01-Mongoose-Virtuals/Solved/` in the command line and run `npm start`.

* Open Insomnia Core and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 When we make a POST request to `http://localhost:3001/submit` we format the data for a new user in JSON:

     ```js
     {
      "firstName": "Jane",
       "lastName": "Doe",
       "password": "Password123",
       "email": "janedoe@email.com"
      }
      ```

  * 🔑 The response we get back includes a `username` field, which is the first part of the email address. That's the virtual property.

  * 🔑 If we make a few more users and then make a GET request to `/users` in Insomnia, we can see all of the users in the database with `username` as a virtual property.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We added a virtual property `commentCount` to the `PizzaSchema` in Lesson 2.
  
  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

  * 🙋 We will need to add virtual properties to the `Thought` and `User` models.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We can create a virtual property that will grab the first part of the email address.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Mongoose Virtuals (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-Mongoose-Virtuals/README.md`, which are also shown here:

   ```md
   # Mongoose Virtuals

   In this activity, you will use Mongoose virtuals to add a property to a user that won't be stored in the database.

   ## Instructions

   * Open [User.js](Unsolved/models/User.js) and do the following:

     * Create a virtual property named `username` that will be taken from the front part of the email address (before the `@` symbol)

     * Remember to set the `toJSON` schema option to use virtuals and set the `id` to false since we don't need it for virtuals.

   * To test it out, run `npm start` in your command line to start the server.

   * Open Insomnia Core and make a POST request to `/submit` with data for a new user in JSON format.

     * You should see the response in JSON that includes a `username` virtual property.

     * If you make a few more users and then make a GET request to `/users` in Insomnia Core, you should see all of the users in the database with `username` as a virtual property.

   ## Hint(s)

   * You can use `slice()` or `split()` to get the front part of the email address.
   ```

### 5. Instructor Review: Mongoose Virtuals (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points (:key:) below to review the following key points (✔️):

  * ✔️ `.virtual()`

  * ✔️ `.slice()` or `.split()`

  * ✔️ `toJSON`

* Open `01-Mongoose-Virtuals/Solved/models/User.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 First we need to create a virtual property called `username` for the `UserSchema`.

     ```js
     UserSchema.virtual('username').get(function() {
     });
     ```

  * 🔑 We can use `.slice()` or `.split()` to get the first part of the email address to use for our `username`. Here is how you could do it with `.slice()`.

     ```js
     return this.email.slice(0, this.email.indexOf('@'));
     ```

  * 🔑 Finally, in the `UserSchema` we need to add a `toJSON` schema option that sets `virtuals` to `true` and `id` to `false`.

     ```js
     {
       toJSON: {
         virtuals: true
       },
       id: false
     }
     ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What is the benefit of using virtual properties?

  * 🙋 Virtuals allow us to add more information to a database response so that we don't have to add in the information manually with a helper before responding to the API request.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 2, read the [Mongoose Docs on Virtuals](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/tutorials/virtuals.html), and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Subdocuments (5 min)

* Navigate to `02-Subdocuments/Solved` in your command line and run `npm start` to start the server.

* Open Insomnia Core and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 When we make a POST request to `http://localhost:3001/api/notebooks` with data for a new notebook in JSON format, a new notebook is created.

     ```js
     {
       "title": "Notebook 1"
     }
     ```

  * 🔑 Using the `_id` of the notebook we just created, we can make a POST request to `http://localhost:3001/api/notebooks/:notebookId/notes` with data for a new note in JSON format.

     ```js
     {
       "noteText": "Here is Note 1"
     }
     ```

  * In the response we get back, we can see the notebook with the note as a subdocument.

  * 🔑 Using the `noteId` of the note we just created, we can make a DELETE request to `http://localhost:3001/api/notebooks/:notebookId/notes/:noteId`. You should see the note deleted from the notebook.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We created replies as a subdocument array for comments in Lesson 3. 

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

  * 🙋 We will need to use subdocuments to add reactions to thoughts in the Challenge.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We need to create a `noteSchema` to be used by the notebook. We also need to create a POST route and DELETE route to create and delete a note from the notebook. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Subdocuments (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Subdocuments/README.md`, which are also shown here:

   ```md
   # Subdocuments

   In this activity, you will create notes as a subdocument array for notebooks.

   ## Instructions

   * Open [Notebook.js](Unsolved/models/Notebook.js) to see the notebook schema and how it is including the notes.

   * In the [models/](Unsolved/models/) folder, create a `Note.js` file and create the `noteSchema`.

     * Import `Schema` and `Types` from Mongoose.

     * The `noteSchema` should include a `noteId` field that defaults to `new Types.ObjectId()` and a `noteText` field which is a required `String`.

     * Be sure to export `noteSchema`.

   * Open [server.js](Unsolved/server.js) and modify the following routes:

     * Modify the POST route to `/api/notebooks/:notebookId/notes` to create a new note for a notebook. 

     * Modify the DELETE route to `/api/notebooks/:notebookId/notes/:noteId` to delete a note from a notebook.

   * To test it out, run `npm start` in your command line to start the server.

   * Open Insomnia Core and make a POST request to `/api/notebooks` with data for a new notebook in JSON format.

     * Using the `_id` of the notebook, make a POST request to `/api/notebooks/:notebookId/notes` with data for a new note in JSON format.

     * Using the `noteId` of the note, make a DELETE request to `/api/notebooks/:notebookId/notes/:noteId`.

     ## Hint(s)

     * Remember to include `{ runValidators: true, new: true }` when querying the `Notebook` to ensure that the values in `req` adhere to the `noteSchema` in your notebook. 

     * If there is no notebook data returned, then return a 404 status with an error message.

     * If there are any errors, catch them and log them into the console as well as return a 500 status.
   ```

### 8. Instructor Review: Subdocuments (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points (:key:) below to review the following key points (✔️):

  * ✔️ `noteSchema`

  * ✔️ `$addToSet`

  * ✔️ `$pull`

* Open `02-Subdocuments/Solved/models/Notebook.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We are requiring the `noteSchema` on top, and notice how we have included it in the `notebookSchema` as a subdocument array.

     ```js
     const noteSchema = require('./Note');

     notes: [noteSchema]
     ```

* Open `02-Subdocuments/Solved/models/Note.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We bring in `Schema` and `Types` from Mongoose. 

     ```js
     const { Schema, Types } = require('mongoose');
     ```

  * 🔑 We set up the `noteSchema` with a `noteId` field and a `noteText` field.

     ```js
     const noteSchema = new Schema({
       noteId: {
         type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
         default: () => new Types.ObjectId(),
       },

       noteText: {
         type: String,
         required: true,
       },
     });
     ```

  * Finally we export the `noteSchema`.

     ```js
     module.exports = noteSchema;
     ```

* Open `02-Subdocuments/Solved/server.js` in your IDE and explain the following:
  
  * Notice we are only bringing in the `Notebook`. `Note` is a subdocument of `Notebook`!

     ```js
     const { Notebook } = require('./models');
     ```

  * To create a new note for a notebook, we make a POST request to `/api/notebooks/:notebookId/notes`. 
  
    * We query the `Notebook` collection to find the specific `notebook` that the note is being created for using `findOneAndUpdate()`.

    * 🔑 Then we use `$addToSet` to create a new note and push it into the `notes` subdocument array.

    * We include `{ runValidators: true, new: true }` to ensure that the values in `req` adhere to the `noteSchema` in the notebook.

       ```js
       app.post('/api/notebooks/:notebookId/notes', (req, res) => {
         Notebook.findOneAndUpdate(
           { _id: req.params.notebookId },
           { $addToSet: { notes: req.body } },
           { runValidators: true, new: true }
         )
       ```

    * If there is no notebook data returned, then we return a 404 status with an error message.

       ```js
       .then(dbNotebookData => {
         if (!dbNotebookData) {
           return res.status(404).json({ message: 'No notebook with this id!' });
         }
         res.json(dbNotebookData);
       })
       ```

    * If there are any errors, we catch them and log them into the console as well as return a 500 status.

       ```js
       .catch(err => {
         console.log(err);
         res.status(500).json(err);
       });
       ```

  * In order to delete the note, we make a DELETE request to `/api/notebooks/:notebookId/notes/:noteId`.

    * We query the `Notebook` collection to find the specific `notebook` that has the `note` we are trying to delete using the `notebookId` and `noteId` in the params.

    * 🔑 Then we use `$pull` to pull the note from the subdocument array.

    * Again we include the `runValidators`.

       ```js
       app.delete('/api/notebooks/:notebookId/notes/:noteId', (req, res) => {
         Notebook.findOneAndUpdate(
           { _id: req.params.notebookId },
           { $pull: { notes: { noteId: req.params.noteId } } },
           { runValidators: true, new: true }
         )
       ```

    * If there is no notebook data returned, then we return a 404 status with an error message. If there are any errors, we catch them and log them into the console as well as return a 500 status.

       ```js
       .then(dbNotebookData => {
         if (!dbNotebookData) {
           return res.status(404).json({ message: 'No notebook with this id!' });
         }
         res.json(dbNotebookData);
       })
       .catch(err => {
         console.log(err);
         res.status(500).json(err);
       });
       ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are the similarities and differences between subdocuments and individual documents?

  * 🙋 Like normal documents, subdocuments can have middleware, custom validation logic, and virtuals. However unlike normal documents, they cannot be saved separately and are only saved whenever their top-level parent document gets saved. 

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 3 read the [Mongoose Docs on Subdocuments](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/subdocs.html), and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

  * 🙋 We covered Mongoose virtuals and subdocuments.

  * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

  * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful.

  * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

  * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the Challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

  * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

  * 🙋 We covered virtuals in Lesson 2 and subdocuments in Lesson 3.

  * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Use student answers to transition to Office Hours.

### 10. Challenge Review (30 min)

* Take this time to help get students unblocked on the current Challenge that they are working through.

* Expect that students may ask for the following:

  * Further review on a particular subject

  * Debugging assistance

  * Help with computer issues

  * Guidance with a particular tool
