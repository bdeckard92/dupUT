# Module 18 Instructor Overview: noSQL

## Overview

In this week's virtual classes, you'll go over Mongoose virtuals, subdocuments, schema, CRUD operations, and the populate method.

## Virtual Classes

[Recommended Class](./18.1-RECOMMENDED.md)

[Required Class](./18.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* This last phase of the boot camp is more about being employer-ready, improving the skills they have already learned, and making their web applications more performant and efficient. Basically, students will focus on "Life after Boot Camp". 

* Be sure students have installed MongoDB and Mongoose before starting their lessons. The install instructions are provided in the `Up and Running` section in Canvas. 

* Students will use Insomnia Core to test their API routes instead of relying on a front end in this week's activities.

* CRUD operations using Mongoose are introduced in Lesson 1. Mongoose virtuals, subdocuments, populate are used in Lesson 2. Mongoose schema is introduced in Lesson 1 but validations are used in Lesson 5.
