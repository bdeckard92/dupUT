# Module 18 Instructor Overview: NoSQL

## Overview

In this week's virtual classes, you'll go over Mongoose virtuals, subdocuments, schema, CRUD operations, and the `.populate()` method.

## Virtual Classes

[Recommended Class](./18.1-RECOMMENDED.md)

[Required Class](./18.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* This last phase of the boot camp is more about being employer-ready, improving the skills they have already learned, and making their web applications more performant and efficient. Basically, students will focus on "Life after Boot Camp". 

* Be sure students have installed MongoDB and Mongoose before starting their lessons. The install instructions are provided in the `Up and Running` section in Canvas. 

* Students will use Insomnia Core to test their API routes instead of relying on a front end in this week's virtual classes.

* CRUD operations using Mongoose are introduced in Lesson 1. Mongoose virtuals, subdocuments, and the `.populate()` method are used in Lesson 2. Mongoose schema is introduced in Lesson 1 but validations are used in Lesson 5.

* Although students will learn how to deploy MongoDB applications to Heroku using MongoDB Atlas in their asynchronous lessons, ensure that they have the supplemental guides on [Setting Up MongoDB Atlas](../../01-Class-Content/18-NoSQL/04-Supplemental/MongoAtlas-Setup.md) and [Deploying with Heroku and MongoDB Atlas](../../01-Class-Content/18-NoSQL/04-Supplemental/MongoAtlas-Deploy.md).

## Career Connection

During each lesson that students work through, they will also view a Career Connection section that will tie together the academic content with Career Services and how this material will be applicable to them in their future career.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Director and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careerservicesonlineevents.splashthat.com/).
