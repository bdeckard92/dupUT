# Module 07 Instructor Overview: Project 1

## Overview

In this week's virtual classes, you'll introduce agile project management and working collaboratively with git branching.

## Virtual Classes

* [Virtual Class 07.1](./07.1-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* There is no lesson plan for the second virtual class this week. Use the entirety of class time as office hours to assist students with their projects. In place of lecture and activities, hold stand-up meetings with each group to gauge progress and advise as necessary.

* Students can use the [API_Resources](../../01-Class-Content/07-Project-1/04-Supplemental/API_Resources.md) for ideas on free APIs that don't require CORS to use in their projects.

## Career Connection

During each lesson that students work through, they will also view a Career Connection section that will tie together the academic content with career services and how this material will be applicable to them in their future career.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Coach and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careerservicesonlineevents.splashthat.com/).

If you'd like more information on career services, visit the [career services resources page](https://careernetwork.2u.com//).
