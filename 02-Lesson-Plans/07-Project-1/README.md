# Module 07 Instructor Overview: Project 1

## Overview

In this module, you will introduce agile project management and help students with their first project, an API-powered interactive front-end web application that pulls data from multiple sources in a creative way. Students will learn how to write user stories and acceptance criteria. Students will create a new repository for their project and learn how to use GitHub Issues and GitHub Projects to keep track of their project progress. You will assume the role of "scrummaster" and hold daily scrum meetings with each group.

## Virtual Classes

Here are the lesson plans for this week's virtual classes:

* [07.1 Virtual Class](./07.1-REQUIRED.md)

* [07.2 Virtual Class](./07.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* Prepare a list of project group members prior to the first class for this module. Assign three students per group: one advanced, one average, one struggling. You can add a slide to this module's slide deck to list the group members, or you can send the list out to students via Slack. Let students know that they will be allowed to create their own groups for the final project.

* If students complain about group configurations, remind them of the following:

  * In the real world, you don't get to choose your coworkers.

  * Working collaboratively is an important skill to acquire as a developer.

* The Instructor Demo activities on the first day ask you to create a project repository. You can create one on-the-fly or you may want to create one in advance.

* Be sure to spend plenty of time making sure that students can follow best practices while collaborating using Git.

* For ideas on free APIs that don't require CORS to use in their project, students can refer to the [API Resources blog post on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/api-resources).

## Career Connection

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Coach and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for career services workshops](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp).

If you'd like more information about career services, visit the [career services resources page](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp/).

## Heads-Up

* In the next module, students will present their group project on the last day of class.

* Students must have a deployed project by presentation day, so encourage students to deploy their projects by the class before presentation day at the latest. Deployed projects can always be updated, so it is recommended that students deploy early on and update their live version with every new feature.

* Prepare a slide deck of superlative awards to give to each group on presentation day. Here is an [example slide deck of superlative awards](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fJGzsclaQ5TKBk3EnL7Gc-bg1ijSGM6_oB1gvpKYnZE/edit?usp=sharing).
