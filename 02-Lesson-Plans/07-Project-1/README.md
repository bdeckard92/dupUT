## Virtual Classes

[Recommended](./07.1-RECOMMENDED.md)


## Instructor Notes

* There is no lesson plan for the Required session. Use the entirety of class time as office hours to assist students with their projects. In place of lecture and activities, hold stand-up meetings with each group to gauge progress and advise as necessary.

* Students can use the [API_Resources](../../01-Class-Content/07-Project-1/04-Supplemental/API_Resources.md) for ideas on free APIs that don't require CORS to use in their projects.

## Module Challenge

N/A


## Heads-Up

* Students will present their group projects during next week's Required session. Prepare a slide deck of superlative 'awards' to give to each group. Here is [an example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QlPJhHnHvLLtKheKl4opm7tibkjjALZeAzwVvZdJDO0/edit?usp=sharing) of superlative 'awards'.
