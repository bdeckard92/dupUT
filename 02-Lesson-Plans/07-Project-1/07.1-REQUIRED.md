# Module 07 Virtual Class: Project 1

## Overview

In this class, we will learn about agile project management and create our own GitHub issues and projects in preparation for Project 1.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Explain agile software development

* Explain minimum viable product (MVP) in relation to agile software development

* Create GitHub Issues and Projects

* Write user stories

* Explain scrum and standing meetings

* Submit a project proposal for feedback

## Instructor Notes

* Determine project groups prior to class. Assign three students per group: one advanced, one average, one struggling.  **DO NOT allow students to work alone or in pairs.** Group projects are one of the few opportunities for students to work collaboratively.

* If students complain about group configurations, remind them of the following:

  * In the real-world, you don't get to choose your co-workers

  * Working collaboratively is an important skill to acquire as a developer

* Students will be allowed to form their own groups for the final project.

* The first 50 minutes of class are lecture on agile software development. Students then break into groups to brainstorm ideas and prepare user stories and wireframes. Use the time after break to meet with each team to discuss their idea and course correct as you see fit.

* The Instructor Demo activities ask you to create a project repository. You can create one on-the-fly or you may want to create on in advance.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (5 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Direct students to post individual questions in the Zoom chat to be addressed by TAs and/or at the end of class.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è How are you feeling about your progress so far?

    * üôã We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back at what we accomplished and acknowledge that it's a lot! It‚Äôs also okay to feel overwhelmed&mdash;as long as you don‚Äôt give up.

    * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with this topic?

    * üôã Let's do Fist to Five together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 2. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* Present the [Project 1 slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BFQmjVz7UDlGclA6I7MVow-fF4ppEB6AxzaxAm7nQIk/edit?usp=sharing) and use the question prompts to facilitate the following discussion:

  * **What is a project?**: We're about to begin our first project. But first, what is a project?

     * **Project**: A project is "any undertaking, carried out individually or collaboratively and possibly involving research or design, that is carefully planned (usually by a project team) to achieve a particular aim." (Source: [Wikipedia article on Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project))

  * **How do we carefully plan a project?**:

     * **Project management**: the practice of initiating, planning, executing, controlling, and closing the work of a team to achieve specific goals and meet specific success criteria at the specified time. The primary challenge of project management is to achieve all of the project goals within the given constraints. (Source: [Wikipedia article on Project Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management))

  * **What is the definition of "agile"?**: In general, what does it mean to be agile?

     * **agile [ aj-uhl, -ahyl ]**: According to dictionary.com, agile is defined as "quick and well-coordinated in movement".

  * **What is agile software development?**: What do we think "agile" means in terms of software development?

     * **Agile software development**: Agile software development is an iterative approach to developing software. Teams deliver value to their customers faster by working incrementally rather than working towards a big launch. Teams improve and respond to change by continuously evaluating project plans, requirements and user needs.

  * **What is iterative development?**: What is iteration? If iteration is the repetition of a process in order to generate a sequence of outcomes, what is iterative development?

     * **Iterative development**: In an iterative approach to development, working software is the primary measure of progress. Our goal is to build functional applications, even if they are very simple, like a skateboard. If we set out to build a sports car, we may never get there and we will have unhappy customers along the way.

  * **What is an MVP?**: It's not "most valuable player".

     * **Minimum Viable Product**: A minimum viable product is a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers and provide feedback for future product development. (Source: [Wikipedia article on MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product))

  * **How do we determine an MVP?**: How do we know what our minimum viable product is?

     * **Determining a Minimum Viable Product**: There are a lot of approaches to defining a minimum viable product, but we can simplify it to three questions: 1) who is your audience?; 2) what is the problem that the product will address?; 3) how does the product solve that problem?

  * **What is a user story?**:

     * **User stories**: In software development and product management, a user story is an informal, natural language description of one or more features of a software system. User stories are often written from the perspective of an end user or user of a system. (Source: [Wikipedia article on User Story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story))

  * **What are acceptance criteria?**:

     * **Acceptance criteria**: Acceptance criteria define the boundaries of a user story and are used to confirm when a story is completed and working as intended. (Source: [Wikipedia article on Acceptance Criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story#Acceptance_criteria))

  * **What is daily scrum?**:

     * **Stand-up Meetings**: Stand-up meetings are used to hold teams accountable to each other. Team members make commitments to work on aspects of the project and report out progress. Stand-up meetings are useful in identifying issues as they arise and developing plans to resolve them. There are generally three questions each team member answers in a stand-up: 1) What was accomplished?; 2) What are your goals?; 3) Are there any obstacles to achieving your goals? (Source: [Wikipedia article on Stand-Up Meeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting))

  * **Project Timeline**: On the first day, we'll divide into groups, write a user story, create a wireframe, create a user flow diagram, and submit a project proposal for approval. We will continue to work on project development until project presentations on the sixth day.
   * **Get Professional**: Remember, projects are your portfolio pieces. Use project week as an opportunity to push yourself and prove your knowledge. Keep you MVP simple and add features as you go to avoid feature creep.

  * **Project Requirements**: Discuss the project requirements outlined in the slide deck.

  * **Presentation Requirements**: Discuss the presentation requirements outlined in the slide deck.

  * **Project Metrics**: Your project will be evaluated on its concept, design, functionality, collaboration, and presentation.

  * **API Suggestions**: It is recommended that you use an API that does the following: allows CORS, requires simple or no authentication, uses JSON, and is well documented.

  * **Today's Project Checklist**:

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 3. Instructor Demo: GitHub Issues (5 min)

* Navigate to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) in your browser and demonstrate the following:

   * We start by creating a new repository for our project.

   * After creating our project repository, we see an `Issues` tab next to the `Code` tab.

   * If we navigate to the `Issues` tab, we will see any open Issues.

   * If we click the `New Issue` button, we are routed to a form where we can create a new issue.

   * When we create an Issue, we want to give it a descriptive and accurate title:

   ```md
   See referral traffic for inbound analysis
   ```

   * Then we add the user story:

   ```md
   AS A marketing analyst
   I WANT to see referral traffic
   SO THAT I can adapt strategy to convert more leads
   ```

   * We also want to add acceptance criteria:

   ```md
   GIVEN I am an authenticated user
   WHEN I request a range of referral traffic
   THEN a chart is generated
   ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What is the difference between user stories and issues?

  * üôã User stories are informal descriptions, whereas issues are our way of tracking features, tasks, bugs, or other improvements.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: User Stories (15 min)

* Open the slide deck and direct students to follow the slide prompt to write a user story for one of the following prompts:

1. A web application that keeps track of a company‚Äôs payroll.

2. A mobile application that finds nearby restaurants.

3. A reminder app that keeps track of important tasks.

* Upon completion, ask a few students to name the prompt they chose, and describe the user story.

### 5. Instructor Do: Create Repository (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Repeat the process of creating a repository and protecting the `main` branch if necessary.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Branching and Pull Requests (5 min)

* Navigate to the repository from the previous activity and demonstrate the following:

    * Clone the project repo onto your computer and `cd` into it.

    * üîë Run the following command in your terminal to create and checkout to a new branch:

         ```
         git checkout -b add-html-skeleton
         ```

    * We should now be on a new branch named `add-html-skeleton`. To verify that this worked, run the following command:

         ```
         git branch
         ```

    * We should see two branches listed: `main` and `add-html-skeleton`. The `add-html-skeleton` branch should have an asterisk to the left of it. This indicates that this is the branch you're currently on.

    * üîë At the root of the repo, create a new file named `index.html`. Inside this file, add code for a basic HTML skeleton and save.

    * üîë From the command line, add and commit the changes. Then push up your code by running following command:

         ```
         git push origin add-html-skeleton
         ```

    * This should push up your code to to GitHub on a branch with the same name (`add-html-skeleton`).

    * üîë Go to the main repo page at github.com and click "Compare & pull request".

    * On the next screen, add a description of the work that was done and click the "Pull Request" button.

    * If completed successfully, we should see the pull request listed under the repo's "Pull request" tab.

    * üîë Now go to your GitHub repo's main page and go to the "Pull request" section. Select the `add-html-skeleton` pull request from the list.

    * At the next page select the option to see the "Files changed".

    * You should be presented with all of the files that were changed in this PR.

    * If there are any changes you would like made, you can click the line number to leave a comment the PR author will see and should address before approval. Otherwise click "Review changes" and approve the PR.

    * üîë Click the "Merge pull request" button to add the branch's changes into main. Once complete you can delete the feature branch from your machine by running the following command:

         ```
         git branch -D add-html-skeleton
         ```

    * Remember to use `git pull` on your main branch to update it.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è Why do we want to review pull requests?

    * üôã To ensure that the code to be merged is functional and does not create conflicts.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Branching and Pull Requests (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Stu_Branching-Pushing/README.md`, which are also shown here:

    ```md
    # Git Branching and Pull Requests

    In this activity, we will create a new branch, implement a feature, and then submit a pull request back into main. We will also cover reviewing pull requests and merging them into main.

    # Instructions

    ## Part I: Branching and Submitting a Pull Request

    In this section, we will create a branch, add a feature, and submit a pull request. **Only one group member should complete this section, everyone else should observe.**

    * Clone your project repository onto your computer and `cd` into it.

    * Run the following command in your terminal to create and checkout to a new branch:

         git checkout -b add-html-skeleton

    * You should now be on a new branch named "add-html-skeleton". In order to verify this worked, run the following command in your terminal:

         git branch

    * You should see two branches listed: `main` and `add-html-skeleton`. The `add-html-skeleton` branch should have an asterisk to the left of it. This indicates that this is the branch you're currently on.

    * At the root of the repository, create a new file named `index.html`. Inside this file, add code for a basic HTML skeleton and save.

    * In your terminal, add and commit the changes. Then push up your code by running the following command in your terminal:

         git push origin add-html-skeleton

    * This should push up your code to to GitHub on a branch with the same name (`add-html-skeleton`).

    * Go to the main repository page at github.com and you should see the following:

    ![Recently Pushed](Images/01-Recently-Pushed.png)

    * Click "Compare & pull request".

    * On the next screen, add a description of the work that was done and click the "Pull Request" button.

    ![Recently Pushed](Images/02-Pull-Request.png)

    * If completed successfully, you should see the pull request listed under the repository's "Pull request" tab.

    ![PR List](Images/03-PR-List.png)

    ## Part II: Reviewing a Pull Request

    In this section, we will review the pull request from Part I and merge it into main. **A different project member should complete this section while others observe**.

    * Clone the repository to your computer if you haven't already done so and `cd` into it.

    * First you will want to test the changes introduced by the `add-html-skeleton` branch locally. In order to examine the new branch on your local machine, run the following commands in your terminal:

         git fetch
         git checkout -b add-html-skeleton origin/add-html-skeleton

    * This code should bring the copy of the `add-html-skeleton` branch that's on GitHub onto your computer.

    * Make sure this worked by verifying that there's an `index.html` file in your local repository.

    * Normally you'd run the code here to make sure everything works properly.

    * Check back out to your local `main` branch by running the following in your terminal:

         git checkout main

    * Now go to your GitHub repository's main page and go to the "Pull request" section. Select the `add-html-skeleton` pull request from the list.

    ![PR List](Images/03-PR-List.png)

    * At the next page select the option to see the "Files changed".

    ![Review](Images/04-Review.png)

    * You should be presented with all of the files that were changed in this PR.

    ![Files Changed](Images/05-Files-Changed.png)

    * If there are any changes you would like made, you can click the line number to leave a comment the PR author will see and should address before approval. Otherwise click "Review changes" and approve the PR. You should be taken to the following screen:

    ![Approve](Images/06-Approve.png)

    * Click the "Merge pull request" button to add the branch's changes into main. Once complete you can delete the feature branch from your machine by running the following in your terminal:

         git branch -D add-html-skeleton

    * Remember to use `git pull` on your main branch to update it.
