# 07.2 Virtual Class: Project 1

## Overview

In today's virtual class, students will continue working on their projects.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Make progress towards building the MVP of their project.

## Instructor Notes

* There is no classroom instruction today.

* You will assume the role of "scrummaster" and hold scrum meetings with each group. The purpose of these scrums is to:

	* Gauge progress on projects.

	* Course correct if scope creeps or focus shifts.

	* Most importantly, hold students accountable. Participation is required to receive a passing grade.

* Keep the scrums short. Ask **each and every** student the following questions:

	* What did you accomplish?

	* What are your goals?

	* Are there any obstacles?

* Prioritize meeting with any groups that have not yet identified a project idea, drafted a user story, or created a wireframe. These are your at-risk groups.
