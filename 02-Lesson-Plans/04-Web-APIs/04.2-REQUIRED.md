# Module 04 Virtual Class: Web APIs

## Overview

In today's virtual class, students will review timers and `localStorage`, and build a simple trivia game using DOM methods.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class students will be able to:

* Implement and explain timers and callbacks

* Store information on HTML elements by using data attributes.

* Store values in `localStorage`

* Build a simple web application using DOM methods

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate questions students may have.

* In the module project, students will work with `localStorage` in Lesson 4 when they add persistence to their to-do list. They also worked with it lightly in Module 03, so they should have a general idea of how to use it.

* Students do not use timers in the module project, so this is the most important topic to convey today. They will need to use timers for the module Challenge.

* The question game will get students used to the concept of manually iterating through an array of objects as opposed to using `for` loops. This iteration, combined with timers, is very close to the module Challenge's core functionality.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

## Office Hours

Encourage students to work on the remaining module algorithms during Office Hours. Review the algorithm solutions 5–10 minutes before class begins or during Office Hours after class.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What did you learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

  * 🙋 We learned about web APIs using `window` and the Document Object Model. We are moving fast compared to traditional learners. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

  * ☝️ Did anyone have an "Aha!" or "Eureka!" moment this week? When was it and why did things suddenly click for you?

  * 🙋 Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we're thinking about it.

  * ☝️ Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

  * 🙋 It's easy to get stuck when you're learning web development. It's important to learn how to get unstuck because it happens to the pros too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the tool's official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups are great because explaining your problems to someone else often reveals the solution.

### 2. Review Current Challenge (5 min)

* Open `02-Challenge/Main/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * This week's Challenge is a coding quiz.

  * When we click 'Start Quiz', we are presented with a series of multiple choice questions.

  * Starting the quiz also starts a timer in the upper right corner.

  * When all questions are answered or time runs out, we are presented with our final score and a field to enter our initials.

  * If we enter our initials, we will see them in listed on `/highscore.html`. If we close and reopen the browser or refresh the application, our high score persists.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What recently acquired skills will help us build this challenge?

  * 🙋 Web APIs, specifically DOM methods and browser storage.

  * ☝️ How are these skills relevant to a career in web development?

  * 🙋 Web APIs are fundamental to web development.

  * ☝️ How will this challenge improve your portfolio?

  * 🙋 Not only is this challenge a coding quiz, it will showcase understanding web APIs, browser storage and timers.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 3. Instructor Demo: Timers (5 min)

* Open `03-Timers/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 When we click the "Start" button, we see a countdown of how many seconds are remaining.

  * 🔑 Once it hits 0, a message is shown on the screen one word at a time.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 Although we didn't cover timers in our lessons, it will be included in this week's Challenge, so this will be a good opportunity to practice.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  * 🙋 The challenge uses a countdown. We will need to know how to update the DOM with timers.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We will use `setInterval()` to repeatedly call a function with a fixed time delay between each call. We will also use `clearInterval()` to cancel the timed, repeating action which was previously established by a call to `setInterval()`.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Timers (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `03-Timers/README.md`.

```md
# Countdown Timer

In this activity, you will create a timer that will count down from 5 and display a message when it hits 0. 

## Instructions

* Open [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) and examine the HTML code in the `<body>`.

* Open [script.js](Unsolved/assets/js/script.js) and complete the `countdown()` function that will count down from 5.

  * Complete the `setInterval()` method to call a function to be executed every 1000 milliseconds

  * As long as the `timeLeft` is greater than 1, set the `textContent` of `timerEl` to show the remaining seconds, and decrement `timeLeft` by 1.

  * Once the `timeLeft` gets to 0, set the `textContent` of `timerEl` to an empty string, use `clearInterval()` to stop the timer, and call the `displayMessage()` function.

## Hint(s)

* Look at the `displayMessage()` function to see an example of how to use `setInterval()` and `clearInterval()`.

* You can also refer to the MDN Web Docs on [setInterval()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setInterval) and [clearInterval()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/clearInterval) for more information.
```

### 5. Instructor Review: Timers  (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ `setInterval()`

  * ✔️ `clearInterval()`

* Open `03-Timers/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We first use `getElementById()` to select the HTML elements with "countdown", "main", "start" IDs.

    ```js
    var timerEl = document.getElementById('countdown');
    var mainEl = document.getElementById('main');
    var startBtn = document.getElementById('start');
    ```

  * We then declare a `message` variable with a string of text. We then use the `.split()` method to _split_ the string into individual elements in an array, `words`.

    ```js
    var message = 'Congratulations! Now you are prepared to tackle the Challenge this week! Good luck!';
    var words = message.split(' ');
    ```

  * We declare a `countdown()` function. Within our `countdown()` function, we declare a `timeLeft` variable and set it to 5.

    ```js
    function countdown() {
      var timeLeft = 5;
    ```

  * 🔑 We then declare `timeInterval` and assign it the value of `setInterval()`. `setInterval()` is a `window` method that repeatedly calls a function, or _callback_, based on a value, or _interval_, passed to it.
  
  * 🔑 Here, we will update the text in `timerEl` at an interval of 1000 ms, or 1 second. With each interval, we _decrement_ the value of `timeLeft`. If `timeLeft` is equal to 0, we use `clearInterval()` to stop `timeInterval()`.

    ```js
    var timeInterval = setInterval(function() {
      if (timeLeft > 1) {
        timerEl.textContent = timeLeft + ' seconds remaining';
        timeLeft--;
      } else if (timeLeft === 1) {
        timerEl.textContent = timeLeft + ' second remaining';
        timeLeft--;
      } else {
        timerEl.textContent = '';
        clearInterval(timeInterval);
        displayMessage();
      }
    }, 1000);
    ```

  * To briefly explain the `displayMessage()` function, we declare a variable called `wordCount`

    ```js
    function displayMessage() {
      var wordCount = 0;
    ```

  * We then declare a `msgInterval` variable and, as above, assign it the value of `setInterval()`. Within our callback, we check if our `words` array contains anything. If not, we clear the interval.
  
  * Otherwise, we update the `textContent` of `mainEl` with the string at `words[wordCount]`. With each interval, we increment `wordCount`. Each interval is set to the length of 300 milliseconds.

    ```js
    var msgInterval = setInterval(function() {
      if (words[wordCount] === undefined) {
        clearInterval(msgInterval);
      } else {
        mainEl.textContent = words[wordCount];
        wordCount++;
      }
    }, 300);
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why do we need to call `clearInterval()`?

  * 🙋 If we don't call `clearInterval()`, our timer, `setInterval()`, will run indefinitely.

  * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to the lesson plan, read the MDN Web Docs on [setInterval()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setInterval) and [clearInterval()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/clearInterval), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: localStorage  (5 min)

* Open `04-localStorage/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * When opening the application, we are presented with a form to enter an 'Email' and a 'Password'.

  * 🔑 If we enter an email and password, we see them rendered in the 'Last Registered User' panel.

  * 🔑 If we close and reopen or refresh the browser, we see that our email and password persist.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We used this to accomplish saving our todo list in Lesson 4.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  * 🙋 The challenge uses browser storage to store high scores.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We would first scaffold our HTML and set up form fields for 'Email' and 'Password'. We would then write JavaScript to listen for a click event on our form and render the values in the DOM.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: localStorage  (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-localStorage/README.md`.

```md
# Local Storage

In this activity, you have been provided with a sign-up form that successfully submits an email and password. Your job is to write code that saves the email and password to localStorage and renders the last submission to the page.

## Instructions

* Open [script.js](Unsolved/assets/js/script.js) in your IDE.

* In the `renderLastRegistered()` function:

  * Retrieve the last email and password from localStorage.
  
  * If the last registered is null, return early from this function.
  
  * Otherwise, set the text of the `userEmailSpan` and `userPasswordSpan` to their corresponding values from localStorage.

* In the `signUpButton` event listener:

  * Save the email and password to localStorage.

  * Render the last registered email and password.
```

### 8. Instructor Review: localStorage  (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ `localStorage.getItem()`

  * ✔️ `localStorage.setItem()`

* Open `04-localStorage/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We set up our HTML form with two fields for "email" and "password" and a button to "sign-up". Note the form method is `POST`.

  ```html
  <form method="POST">
    <div class="input-group">
      <label for="email">Email</label>
      <input
        type="text"
        name="email"
        id="email"
        placeholder="janedoe@mail.com"
      />
    </div>
    <div class="input-group">
      <label for="password">Password</label>
      <input
        type="password"
        name="password"
        id="password"
        placeholder="supersecure123"
      />
    </div>
    <div id="msg"></div>
    <button id="sign-up">Sign Up</button>
  </form>
  ```

  * We also have a card that will display the "Last Registered User"

  ```html
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Last Registered User:</h2>
    <p><strong>Email:</strong> <span id="user-email"></span></p>
    <p><strong>Password:</strong> <span id="user-password"></span></p>
  </div>
  ```

* Open `04-localStorage/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We use `querySelector()` to select our DOM elements and assign them to variables.

  ```js
  var emailInput = document.querySelector("#email");
  var passwordInput = document.querySelector("#password");
  var signUpButton = document.querySelector("#sign-up");
  var msgDiv = document.querySelector("#msg");
  var userEmailSpan = document.querySelector("#user-email");
  var userPasswordSpan = document.querySelector("#user-password");
  ```

  * 🔑 We declare a `renderLastRegistered()` function. Within `renderLastRegistered()`, we query `localStorage` using the `getItem()` method for both "email" and "password" strings.
  
  ```js
  function renderLastRegistered() {
    var email = localStorage.getItem('email');
    var password = localStorage.getItem('password');
  ```
  
  * If either "email" or "password" are null, our function returns. Otherwise, we render the values using the `textContent` property in the `userEmailSpan` and `userPasswordSpan` elements, respectively.

  ```js
  if (email === null || password === null) {
    return;
  }
  
  userEmailSpan.textContent = email;
  userPasswordSpan.textContent = password;
  ```

  * We use `addEventListener()` on our `signUpButton` and listen for a "click" event. If there is a click event, we prevent the default functionality of the form, which is to `POST` the form content to a server.
  
  ```js
  signUpButton.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
  ```
  
  * Instead, we use `querySelector()` and the `value` property to assign the values in the form fields to `email` and `password` variables.
  
  ```js
  var email = document.querySelector('#email').value;
  var password = document.querySelector('#password').value;
  ```
  
  * 🔑 If `email` and `password` are not empty strings, we store the values in `localStorage` using the `setItem()` method. Last, we call the `renderLastRegistered()` method.

  ```js
  if (email === "") {
    displayMessage("error", "Email cannot be blank");
  } else if (password === "") {
    displayMessage("error", "Password cannot be blank");
  } else {
    displayMessage("success", "Registered successfully");

    localStorage.setItem("email", email);
    localStorage.setItem("password", password);
    renderLastRegistered();
    }
  };
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where _is_ `localStorage`?

  * 🙋 Values stored in `localStorage` are stored _locally_, in the users browser.  

  * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understanding this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [MDN Web Docs on localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Instructor Demo: True or False Game  (5 min)

* Open `05-True-or-False-Game/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 When we open the application, we are presented with a series of statements as confirmation.

  * 🔑 We select OK if the statement is true and Cancel if the statement is false.

  * 🔑 After answering all of the questions, we are presented with our score in an alert.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We used this to battle our enemy robots throughout the Module 03 project.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  * 🙋 The challenge is an interactive coding quiz. This activity is very similar.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We will create an object of question/answer pairs. Next, we would iterate over the questions, creating a `confirm()` for each.  After checking the user's answer against the correct answer, we will alert the user whether it was right or wrong.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 10. Student Do: True or False Game  (20 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `05-True-or-False-Game/README.md`.

```md
# True or False Game

In this activity, you will create a "True or False" game that will ask five questions and return the final score.

## Instructions

* Open [script.js](Unsolved/assets/js/script.js) and implement the following:

  * Create an array with five question objects. Each object in the array should be structured as follows: 

  `{ q: "QUESTION", a: "ANSWER" }`

  * Create a variable to keep track of the score.

  * Write code that will ask the user the questions, one by one, in a confirmation box. The user must answer by selecting OK (for true) or Cancel (for false).

  * Check the user's answer against the correct answer and provide them with an alert telling them if they are right or wrong.

  * Increment the score if the answer is correct.

  * At the end of the game, show an alert that displays the final score.

## Hint(s)

* What can we use to iterate over an array of questions in order to display them one by one?

* Which DOM method can we use to display a confirmation? 

* Which DOM method can we use to display an alert? 
```

### 11. Instructor Review: True or False Game  (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ Using an array of objects to store question / answer pairs

  * ✔️ `confirm()`

  * ✔️ `alert()`

* Open `05-True-or-False-Game/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We first declare an array of objects containing question / answer pairs. You could've used any questions you want! Notice `q` is the statement and `a` is 't' for True and 'f' for False.

  ```js
  var questions = [
    { q: 'The sky is blue.', a: 't' },
    { q: 'There are 365 days in a year.', a: 't' },
    { q: 'There are 42 ounces in a pound.', a: 'f' },
    { q: 'The Declaration of Independence was created in 1745.', a: 'f' },
    { q: 'Bananas are vegetables.', a: 'f' }
  ];
  ```

  * Then we initialize a global `score` variable to keep track of the score.
  
  ```js
  var score = 0;
  ```

  * We then iterate over every object in the `questions` array using a for-loop.
  
  ```js
  for (var i = 0; i < questions.length; i++) {

  }
  ```

  * 🔑 We use `confirm()` to query the user for their answer to each question and store the boolean in a variable, `answer`. If the user selects OK, the boolean returned is `true`, and if the user selects Cancel, the boolean returned is `false`.

  ```js
  var answer = confirm(questions[i].q);
  ```

  * 🔑 We then check if their answer is correct or wrong and increment the score accordingly. We use `alert()` to let the user know if they were correct or wrong.

  ```js
  // Compare answers
  if (
    (answer === true && questions[i].a === 't') ||
    (answer === false && questions[i].a === 'f')
  ) {
    // Increment the score
    score++;
    // Alert the user
    alert('Correct!');
  } else {
    alert('Wrong!');
  }
  ```
  
  * At the end of the game, the user receives the final score as an alert.

  ```js
  alert('You got ' + score + '/' + questions.length);
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why did we store our questions as objects in an array?

  * 🙋 Objects allow us store property / values pairs, such as questions and answers. Storing the objects in an array allows us to easily iterate through each object.

  * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understanding this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [MDN Web Docs on Objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 12. Recap & Promote Additional Resources (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What do you think you absolutely need to know to succeed at the challenge?

  * 🙋 To succeed at the challenge, we need to know how to create elements in the DOM, handle events, and implement timers.

  * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

  * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it is not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful.

  * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material prior to class as possible?

  * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

* Direct students to the additional resources available to them:

  * Reflection and Retrieval

  * Career Connection

  * Dessert Menu

### 13. Introduce Upcoming Challenge (5 min)

* Open `01-Class-Content/05-Third-Party-APIs/02-Challenge/Main/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * In the next challenge, we will be building a 'Work Day Scheduler'.

  * The scheduler is composed of fields for the hours from 9AM to 5PM. We can enter values into the fields and if we click the 'Save' icon next to the field, the value will be stored in `localStorage`.

  * Note that hours in the past are rendered as gray, the current hour is highlighted in red, and upcoming hours are green.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are we learning?

  * 🙋 We are learning to work with third-party APIs. We'll be using Moment.js for working with time in the browser, as well as Bootstrap and jQuery to speed up our CSS and JavaScript development.

  * ☝️ How does this project build off or extend previously learned material?

  * 🙋 We will need an understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build this project.

  * ☝️ How does this project relate to your career goals?

  * 🙋 Managing time and dates is a constant challenge for developers. CSS frameworks are widely used in development and Bootstrap is the most popular. While jQuery is less popular than it was ten years ago, it is still used widely in legacy code bases.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.
