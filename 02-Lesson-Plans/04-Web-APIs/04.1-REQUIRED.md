# Module 04 Virtual Class: Web APIs

## Overview

In today's virtual class, students will review creating and appending to the DOM using JavaScript and initializing event listeners.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class students will be able to:

* Inspect the `Window` object.

* Set up event listeners for click events.

* Query the DOM for elements by their selector.

* Create and append elements to the document.

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate questions students may have.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* In Lesson 1 of the async material for this week, students are introduced to both basic DOM manipulation like `querySelector()`, `createElement()` and `appendChild()` along with `addEventListener()` when they are tasked with creating a new todo item upon a button click. They also update DOM element properties such as `className` and `textContent` in Lesson 1.

* Setting and reading attribute data is in Lesson 3 of this week's async material, as that is when students dynamically set and read values from a DOM element's attribute.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Invite students to post questions in the Zoom chat so TAs and/or the instructor can address them at the end of class.

* Open the [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-3daePaDjvwnUFY_Vsio7NY9acF9DM7RablesuVAKk4/edit?usp=sharing) and walk through the following slides on foundation setting:

  **Big Picture**: This is an opportunity to zoom out and look at the big picture of where students are in the course. Take a moment to discuss a few real-world examples of why this week's topics are valuable.

  **Boot Camp Pointers**: Review some logistics that will help students stay on track. This is an opportunity to speak to what students might need at this particular point in the course.

  **This Week**: Review the key skills students will be learning this week.

  **This Week's Assignment**: Give a quick summary of this week's Challenge assignment and describe how the skills they learn throughout the week will be applied to it.

  **Career Connection**: Reinforce that students will use the skills they learn this week throughout their careers. It's important for them to know the "why" and "how" behind the "what." Give examples of how these skills are used on the job. If you feel comfortable, share examples of how you have used them in your professional career.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What is a technical interview?

  * 🙋 The technical portion of the interview might be an in-person whiteboard format, or it might be through an online assessment platform, such as HackerRank, to assess technical proficiency.

  * ☝️ What is a whiteboard interview? Has anybody heard of this before?

  * 🙋 A whiteboard interview usually takes place in person. You'll be given a marker and asked to solve coding problems on a whiteboard in front of the interviewer(s).

    > **Note**: Point out to students that even though it's called a whiteboard interview, it doesn't necessarily always involve a whiteboard. Many companies use whiteboard techniques in other formats, such as connecting a laptop to a projector or live online through a conferencing platform like Zoom.

  * ☝️ How can we prepare for technical interviews?

  * 🙋 Practice!

* Encourage students to take advantage of completing weekly algorithms and getting involved with platforms such as [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/) and [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) once they feel comfortable doing so.

  **How to Succeed This Week**: Remind students that they might experience moments of frustration as they learn complex concepts and tools and that these times are proven opportunities to deepen knowledge. Consider sharing something about your learning journey. This helps students recognize that everyone starts somewhere, that being a developer means constantly learning new technologies and that they are not alone.

  **Today's Objectives**: Outline the concepts that will be covered in today's lesson. Remind students that they can find the relevant activity files in the "Getting Ready for Class" page in their course content.

### 2. Instructor Do: Student Check-In (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

  * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back at what we accomplished and acknowledge that it is a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed&mdash;as long as you don’t give up.

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic?

  * 🙋 Let's do Fist to Five together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 3. Instructor Demo: Create/Append (5 min)

* Open `01-Create-Append/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 When we open our HTML file in the browser, we see a simple site with a header, a photo with a caption, and a list of favorite foods.

  * 🔑 But when we open `index.html` in our IDE, we only see boilerplate HTML!

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
      <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
      <title>Create and Append</title>
    </head>
    <body>

      <script src="./script.js"></script>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

  * Notice that the `script.js` is loaded and that's where everything is being generated!

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We used this to load a JavaScript file and run JavaScript code in the browser in Lesson 1.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

  * 🙋 We will need to dynamically generate HTML elements.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We would start by getting the `body` element, and then create and append elements to it. Lastly, we would set attributes on the elements to apply style and positioning.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Create/Append (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-Create-Append/README.md`, which is also shown here:

  ````md

### 5. Instructor Review: Create/Append (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with creating and appending elements? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `createElement()`

  * ✔️ `textContent`

  * ✔️ `appendChild()`

* Open `08-Stu_Create-Append/Solved/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We create the ordered list element using `createElement()`, as follows:

    ```js
    var listEl = document.createElement("ol");
    ```

  * The ordered list has four child list elements. We use `createElement()` to create each list item and store the elements in a variable, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    var li1 = document.createElement("li");
    var li2 = document.createElement("li");
    var li3 = document.createElement("li");
    var li4 = document.createElement("li");
    ```

  * We add text to the list elements using the `textContent` property, like in the following example:

    ```js
    li1.textContent = "Apples 🍎 ";
    li2.textContent = "Pizza 🍕 ";
    li3.textContent = "Dumplings 🥟 ";
    li4.textContent = "Cupcakes 🧁 ";
    ```

  * 🔑 We append the ordered list element as a child of the `<div>` that contains the text "My favorite foods are:" using `appendChild()`, as follows:

    ```js
    favoriteEl.appendChild(listEl);
    ```

  * We then append the list items as a child of the ordered list element. This attaches the elements to the HTML document, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    listEl.appendChild(li1);
    listEl.appendChild(li2);
    listEl.appendChild(li3);
    listEl.appendChild(li4);
    ```

  * We add styling to the ordered list element and child list items using `setAttribute()`, like in the following example:

    ```js
    listEl.setAttribute("style", "background:#333333; padding:20px;");
    li1.setAttribute("style", " color:white; background: #666666; padding: 5px; margin-left: 35px;");
    li2.setAttribute("style", " color:white; background: #777777; padding: 5px; margin-left: 35px;");
    li3.setAttribute("style", " color:white; background: #888888; padding: 5px; margin-left: 35px;");
    li4.setAttribute("style", " color:white; background: #999999; padding: 5px; margin-left: 35px;");
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why do we append the list items to the ordered list element `<ol>` and not just the `<body>`?

  * 🙋 It is important to think about the parent-child relationships when appending elements to the DOM. An ordered list is made up of the ordered list element and its child list items. We maintain that relationship by attaching the list items as children of the ordered list. If we attached the list items to the `<body>`, the list items' parent would be the `<body>`, which is not what we want!

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on createElement()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement) and the [MDN Web Docs on appendChild()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Event Listeners (5 min)

* Open `02-Event-Listeners/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 Selecting the Increment button increases the "Current count" by 1.

  * 🔑 Selecting the Increment button increases the "Current count" by 1. Our counter will not drop below zero.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We used this to add a todo item upon a button click in Lesson 1.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

  * 🙋 If we want our web applications to be interactive, we need to handle events in the DOM.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We would first scaffold a simple HTML document with two buttons and a header for the count. Then, in a `script.js` file, we would create a `count` variable for state, and create event handlers to listen for clicks on either of the buttons and update `count` accordingly. Lastly, we would update the header with the current count.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Event Listeners (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Event-Listeners/README.md`, which is also shown here:

  ```md
    # 📐 Add Comments to Implementation of Event Handlers on Mouse Clicks

  Work with a partner to add comments describing the functionality of the code found in [Unsolved](./Unsolved/assets/js/script.js).

  ## 📝 Notes

  Refer to the documentation:

  [MDN Documentation on Event Listeners](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener)

  [MDN Documentation on Query Selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector)

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * A click is just one type of DOM event. What are some others?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 8. Instructor Review: Event Listeners (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with event listeners? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `querySelector()`

  * ✔️ `addEventListener()`

* Open `12-Stu_Event-Listener/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We use `querySelector()` to select the button elements, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    var incrementEl = document.querySelector("#increment");
    var decrementEl = document.querySelector("#decrement");
    ```

  * 🔑 We add an `addEventListener()` to the increment button and set the type of event to be a `click`, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    incrementEl.addEventListener("click", function() {...})
    ```

  * 🔑 The `addEventListener()` method's second parameter is a function that contains the action that we want to execute when the `click` event occurs. This function increments the count by `1` and calls the `setCounterText()` function to update the HTML. See the following code for an example:

    ```js
    function() {
      count++;
      setCounterText();
    }
    ```

  * We repeat the process for the decrement button but use the decrement operator `--` to decrease the count. We add a conditional statement so that the action is performed only if the count is greater than `0`. See the following code for an example:

    ```js
    decrementEl.addEventListener("click", function() {
      if (count > 0) {
        count--;
        setCounterText();
      }
    });
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How can we listen for an event on an element and then react by performing an action?

  * 🙋 We use the`addEventListener()` method. We set the method's first parameter to the type of event that we want to listen for, and the second parameter is the action that we want to be performed when an event, like a click, happens.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on addEventListener()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

  * 🙋 We reviewed creating HTML using DOM methods and listening for clicks on elements using `addEventListener()`.

  * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

  * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful.

  * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

  * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the Challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

  * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

  * 🙋 We covered basic DOM manipulation along with `addEventListener()` in Lesson 1.

  * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Use student answers to transition to Office Hours.

### 10. Challenge Review (30 min)

* Take this time to help get students unblocked on the current Challenge that they are working through.

* Expect that students may ask for the following:

  * Further review on a particular subject

  * Debugging assistance
