# 04.1 Virtual Class: Web APIs

## Overview

In today's virtual class, students will review creating and appending to the DOM using JavaScript and initializing event listeners.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Inspect the `Window` object.

* Set up event listeners for click events.

* Query the DOM for an element by using its selector.

* Create and append elements to the document.

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate questions students may have.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* In Lesson 1 of the async material, students are introduced to basic DOM manipulation like `querySelector()`, `createElement()`, and `appendChild()` as well as with `addEventListener()` when they are tasked with creating a new to-do item upon a button click. They also update DOM element properties, such as `className` and `textContent`.

* Setting and reading attribute data is in Lesson 3, as that is when students dynamically set and read values from a DOM element's attribute.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Invite students to post questions in the Zoom chat so TAs and/or the instructor can address them at the end of class.

* Open the [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-3daePaDjvwnUFY_Vsio7NY9acF9DM7RablesuVAKk4/edit?usp=sharing) and walk through the following slides on foundation setting:

  **Big Picture**: This is an opportunity to zoom out and look at the big picture of where students are in the course. Take a moment to discuss a few real-world examples of why this week's topics are valuable.

  **Boot Camp Pointers**: Review some logistics that will help students stay on track. This is an opportunity to speak to what students might need at this particular point in the course.

  **This Week**: Review the key skills students will be learning this week.

  **This Week's Assignment**: Give a quick summary of this week's Challenge assignment and describe how the skills they learn throughout the week will be applied to it.

  **Career Connection**: Reinforce that students will use the skills they learn this week throughout their careers. It's important for them to know the "why" and "how" behind the "what." Give examples of how these skills are used on the job. If you feel comfortable, share examples of how you have used them in your professional career.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What is a technical interview?

  * 🙋 The technical portion of the interview might be an in-person whiteboard format, or it might be through an online assessment platform, such as HackerRank, to assess technical proficiency.

  * ☝️ What is a whiteboard interview? Has anybody heard of this before?

  * 🙋 A whiteboard interview usually takes place in person. You'll be given a marker and asked to solve coding problems on a whiteboard in front of the interviewer(s).

    > **Note**: Point out to students that even though it's called a "whiteboard interview," it doesn't necessarily always involve a whiteboard. Many companies use whiteboard techniques in other formats, such as connecting a laptop to a projector or live online through a conferencing platform like Zoom.

  * ☝️ How can we prepare for technical interviews?

  * 🙋 Practice!

* Encourage students to take advantage of completing weekly algorithms and getting involved with platforms such as [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/) and [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) once they feel comfortable doing so.

  **How to Succeed This Week**: Remind students that they might experience moments of frustration as they learn complex concepts and tools and that these times are proven opportunities to deepen knowledge. Consider sharing something about your personal learning journey. This helps students recognize that everyone starts somewhere, that they are not alone, and that being a developer means constantly learning new technologies.

  **Today's Agenda**: Outline the concepts that will be covered in today's lesson. Remind students that they can find the relevant activity files in the "Getting Ready for Class" page in their course content.

### 2. Instructor Do: Student Check-In (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

  * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back at what we accomplished and acknowledge that it is a lot. It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed&mdash;as long as we don’t give up!

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic?

  * 🙋 Let's do Fist to Five together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 3. Instructor Demo: Create/Append (5 min)

* Open `01-Create-Append/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 When we open our HTML file in the browser, we see a simple site with a header, a photo with a caption, and a list of favorite foods.

  * 🔑 But when we open `index.html` in our IDE, we only see boilerplate HTML!

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
      <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
      <title>Create and Append</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <script src="./script.js"></script>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

  * Notice that the `script.js` file is loaded and that's where everything is being generated.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We used this to load a JavaScript file and run JavaScript code in the browser in Lesson 1.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

  * 🙋 We will need to dynamically generate HTML elements.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We would start by getting the `body` element, and then create and append elements to it. Lastly, we would set attributes on the elements to apply style and positioning.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Create/Append (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-Create-Append/README.md`, which are also shown here:

  ```md
  # 🏗️ Create an Ordered List Using JavaScript

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a blogger, I want to use JavaScript to create an ordered list of my favorite foods on my webpage.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It is done when an ordered list containing four favorite foods is visible in the HTML below the text "My favorite foods are:".

  * It is done when the ordered list has a background color of `#333333` and padding of `20px`.

  * It is done when each list item has a font color of `white`, padding of `5px`, and `margin-left` of `35px`.

  * It is done when each list item has a different background color.

  ## Assets

  The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

  ![The text "Welcome to my page" appears above a centered kitten photo, above the text "My favorite foods are:" and a list of four foods.](./images/01-screenshot.png)

  ## 💡 Hints

  After creating an element in JavaScript, what additional step must you take to attach the element to the HTML document?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What is the difference between `append()` and `appendChild()`?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 5. Instructor Review: Create/Append (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with creating and appending elements? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use Office Hours to get extra help.

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `createElement()`

  * ✔️ `textContent`

  * ✔️ `appendChild()`

* Open `01-Create-Append/Solved/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We create the ordered list element using `createElement()`.

    ```js
    var listEl = document.createElement("ol");
    ```

  * The ordered list has four child list elements. We use `createElement()` to create each list item and store the elements in a variable.

    ```js
    var li1 = document.createElement("li");
    var li2 = document.createElement("li");
    var li3 = document.createElement("li");
    var li4 = document.createElement("li");
    ```

  * 🔑 We add text to the list elements using the `textContent` property.

    ```js
    li1.textContent = "Apples 🍎 ";
    li2.textContent = "Pizza 🍕 ";
    li3.textContent = "Dumplings 🥟 ";
    li4.textContent = "Cupcakes 🧁 ";
    ```

  * 🔑 We append the ordered list element as a child of the `<div>` that contains the text "My favorite foods are:" using `appendChild()`.

    ```js
    favoriteEl.appendChild(listEl);
    ```

  * We then append the list items as a child of the ordered list element. This attaches the elements to the HTML document.

    ```js
    listEl.appendChild(li1);
    listEl.appendChild(li2);
    listEl.appendChild(li3);
    listEl.appendChild(li4);
    ```

  * We add styling to the ordered list element and child list items by using `setAttribute()`.

    ```js
    listEl.setAttribute("style", "background:#333333; padding:20px;");
    li1.setAttribute("style", " color:white; background: #666666; padding: 5px; margin-left: 35px;");
    li2.setAttribute("style", " color:white; background: #777777; padding: 5px; margin-left: 35px;");
    li3.setAttribute("style", " color:white; background: #888888; padding: 5px; margin-left: 35px;");
    li4.setAttribute("style", " color:white; background: #999999; padding: 5px; margin-left: 35px;");
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why do we append the list items to the ordered list element `<ol>` and not just the `<body>`?

  * 🙋 It is important to think about the parent-child relationships when appending elements to the DOM. An ordered list is made up of the ordered list element and its child list items. We maintain that relationship by attaching the list items as children of the ordered list. If we attached the list items to the `<body>`, the list items' parent would be the `<body>`, which is not what we want!

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on createElement()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement) and the [MDN Web Docs on appendChild()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild), and attend Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Event Listeners (5 min)

* Open `02-Event-Listeners/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 Selecting the Increment button increases the "Current count" by 1.

  * 🔑 Our counter will not drop below zero.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We used this to add a to-do item upon a button click in Lesson 1.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

  * 🙋 If we want our web applications to be interactive, we need to handle events in the DOM.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We would first scaffold a simple HTML document with two buttons and a header for the count. Then, in a `script.js` file, we would create a `count` variable for state, and create event handlers to listen for clicks on either of the buttons and update `count` accordingly. Lastly, we would update the header with the current count.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Event Listeners (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Event-Listeners/README.md`, which are also shown here:

  ```md
  # 📐 Add Comments to Implementation of Event Handlers on Mouse Clicks

  Work with a partner to add comments that describe the functionality of the code found in [Unsolved](./Unsolved/assets/js/script.js).

  ## 📝 Notes

  Refer to the documentation:

  [MDN Documentation on Event Listeners](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener)

  [MDN Documentation on Query Selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector)

  ## Assets

  The following animation demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

  ![The current count number increases when the Increment button is clicked and decreases when the Decrement button is clicked.](./images/01-demo.gif)

  ---

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * A click is just one type of DOM event. What are some others?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 8. Instructor Review: Event Listeners (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with event listeners? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use Office Hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `querySelector()`

  * ✔️ `addEventListener()`

* Open `02-Event-Listeners/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We use `querySelector()` to select the button elements.

    ```js
    var incrementEl = document.querySelector("#increment");
    var decrementEl = document.querySelector("#decrement");
    ```

  * 🔑 We add an `addEventListener()` to the increment button and set the type of event to be a `click`.

    ```js
    incrementEl.addEventListener("click", function() {...})
    ```

  * 🔑 The `addEventListener()` method's second parameter is a function that contains the action we want to execute when the `click` event occurs. This function increments the count by `1` and calls the `setCounterText()` function to update the HTML.

    ```js
    function() {
      count++;
      setCounterText();
    }
    ```

  * We repeat the process for the decrement button but use the decrement operator `--` to decrease the count. We add a conditional statement so that the action is performed only if the count is greater than `0`.

    ```js
    decrementEl.addEventListener("click", function() {
      if (count > 0) {
        count--;
        setCounterText();
      }
    });
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How can we listen for an event on an element and then react by performing an action?

  * 🙋 We use the`addEventListener()` method. We set the method's first parameter to the type of event that we want to listen for, and the second parameter is the action that we want to be performed when an event, such as a click, happens.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on addEventListener()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener), and attend Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Everyone Do: Git Pull Request (30 min)

* Open the [GitHub documentation on contributing to a project](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project) in your browser and explain the following:

  * A **pull request** is a tool that allows us to collaborate and comment on code before it is merged to the main branch.

  * In this activity, we'll practice creating a new repository on GitHub, pulling down the repo to the local machine using `git clone`, and pushing up changes using `git push`. We will also explore pull requests by opening a pull request, reviewing the request, and merging the changes into the main branch.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `Git-Guide/README.md`.

* While everyone is working on the activity, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

* Open your browser, navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com/), and demonstrate the following:

  * We create a new repository by clicking on the green New button and initializing the repo with a `README.md`.

* Open your CLI and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We use `git clone` to copy the repo to the local machine, as follows:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/{user-name}/(your-repo-name).git
    ```

  * 🔑 We create a new branch, where we will make the changes for the pull request, as shown in the following example:

    ```sh
    git checkout -b 01-my-new-feature
    ```

* Open your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * We open VS Code and navigate to the README.md to make a change. We mig:ht add something like the following text:

    ```sh
    Now, I am a demo for a Pull Request!
    ```

* Open your CLI and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 In the command line, we add and commit the change made to the README.md. Then we push it up to the remote branch, making sure to use the name of the branch that we just created, as shown in the following example:

    ```sh
    git add -A
    git commit -m "My first commit"
    git push origin 01-my-new-feature
    ```

* Open your browser, navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com/), and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We navigate to see the changes. We click on Compare & Pull Request to open a pull request.

  * 🔑 We pick the branch that we want to compare the changes against as the **base** branch. We use `main` because we want to merge the changes into `main`.

  * 🔑 We pick the branch that we want to compare (the **comparison** branch). That is the new branch that we just created, or `01-my-new-feature`.

  * 🔑 We fill in the form and click Create Pull Request to create the request.

  * 🔑 We review the changes by clicking the Review Changes button.

  * 🔑 We want to keep the changes and merge them into the `main` branch, so we select Merge Pull Request and then confirm it.

  * 🔑 We open the `main` branch in the repo. The changes made in the branch have been merged.

* Answer any questions before proceeding.

### 10. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

  * 🙋 We reviewed creating HTML using DOM methods and listening for clicks on elements using `addEventListener()`.

  * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

  * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful.
