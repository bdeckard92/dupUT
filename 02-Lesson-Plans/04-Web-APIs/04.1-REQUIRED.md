# Module 04 Virtual Class: Web APIs

## Overview 

In today's virtual class, students will review DOM manipulation and listening for click events. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Manipulate the DOM

* Handle click events using `addEventListener()`

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate questions students may have.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* In Lesson 1 of the async material for this week, students are introduced to both basic DOM manipulation like `querySelector()`, `createElement()` and `appendChild()` along with `addEventListener()` when they are tasked with creating a new todo item upon a button click. They also update DOM element properties such as `className` and `textContent` in Lesson 1.

* Setting and reading attribute data is in Lesson 3 of this week's async material, as that is when students dynamically set and read values from a DOM element's attribute.

## Class Instructions 

### 1. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Invite students to post questions in the Zoom chat so TAs and/or the instructor can address them at the end of class.

* Open the [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-3daePaDjvwnUFY_Vsio7NY9acF9DM7RablesuVAKk4/edit?usp=sharing) and walk through the following slides on foundation setting: 

	**Big Picture**: This is an opportunity to zoom out and look at the big picture of where students are in the course. Take a moment to discuss a few real-world examples of why this week's topics are valuable.

	**Boot Camp Pointers**: Review some logistics that will help students stay on track. This is an opportunity to speak to what students might need at this particular point in the course. 

	**This Week**: Review the key skills students will be learning this week. 

	**This Week's Assignment**: Give a quick summary of this week's Challenge assignment and describe how the skills they learn throughout the week will be applied to it.

	**Career Connection**: Reinforce that students will use the skills they learn this week throughout their careers. It's important for them to know the "why" and "how" behind the "what." Give examples of how these skills are used on the job. If you feel comfortable, share examples of how you have used them in your professional career.

	* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

		* ‚òùÔ∏è What is a technical interview?

		* üôã The technical portion of the interview might be an in-person whiteboarding format, or it might be through an online assessment platform, such as HackerRank, to assess technical proficiency.

		* ‚òùÔ∏è What is a whiteboard interview? Has anybody heard of this before?

		* üôã A whiteboard interview usually takes place in person. You'll be given a marker and asked to solve coding problems on a whiteboard in front of the interviewer(s). 

		**Note**: Point out to students that even though it's called a whiteboard interview, it doesn't necessarily always involve a whiteboard. Many companies use whiteboarding techniques in other formats, such as connecting a laptop to a projector or live online through a conferencing platform like Zoom.

		* ‚òùÔ∏è How can we prepare for technical interviews?

		* üôã Practice! 

	* Encourage students to take advantage of completing weekly algorithms and getting involved with platforms such as [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/) and [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) once they feel comfortable doing so.

	**How to Succeed This Week**: Remind students that they might experience moments of frustration as they learn complex concepts and tools, and that these times are actually proven opportunities to deepen knowledge. Consider sharing something about your personal learning journey. This helps students recognize that everyone starts somewhere, that being a developer means constantly learning new technologies, and that they are not alone.

	**Today's Objectives**: Outline the concepts that will be covered in today's lesson. Remind students that they can find the relevant activity files in the "Getting Ready for Class" page in their course content. 

### 2. Instructor Do: Student Check-In (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How are you feeling about your progress so far?

  * üôã We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back at what we accomplished and acknowledge that it is a lot! It‚Äôs also okay to feel overwhelmed&mdash;as long as you don‚Äôt give up.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with this topic?

  * üôã Let's do Fist to Five together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 3. Instructor Demo: DOM Manipulation (5 min) 

* Open `01-DOM-manipulation/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

	* üîë When we open our HTML file in the browser, we see a simple site with a header, a short description of the page, a photo with a caption, and a list of favorite foods.

	* üîë But when we open `index.html` in our IDE, we only see boilerplate HTML!

	     ```html
	     <!DOCTYPE html>
	     <html lang="en">
		     <head>
			     <meta charset="UTF-8" />
			     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
			     <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
			     <title>Look Ma No HTML</title>
		     </head>
		     <body>
			     <script src="./assets/js/script.js"></script>
		     </body>
	     </html>
	     ```

	* Notice that the `script.js` is loaded and that's where everything is being generated!

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è Where have we used this before?

    * üôã We used this to load a JavaScript file and run JavaScript code in the browser in Lesson 1.

    * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

    * üôã We will need to dynamically generate HTML elements.

    * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?

    * üôã We would start by getting the `body` element, and then create and append elements to it. Lastly, we would set attributes on the elements to apply style and positioning.  

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: DOM Manipulation (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-DOM-manipulation/README.md`, which is also shown here:

     ```md
     # DOM manipulation

     In this activity, you are going to use DOM methods to create an entire webpage.

     ## Instructions

     * Open [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) in your browser and monitor it as you work on this activity.

     * Open [script.js](Unsolved/assets/js/script.js) in your IDE and only work in this file!

     * Using only DOM methods, create an entire HTML page. It should include:

         * A centered h1 with the title of the webpage
  
         * A centered h2 under it with a short description of the webpage.

         * A centered image with a centered caption under it.

         * A list of your favorite foods (or some other list of favorites).

     * If you have some time left, add some extra styling to the elements.

     ## Hints

     * Which DOM methods allow you to create an HTML element, add an HTML element, and add a specified attribute to an HTML element?

     * Which property allows you to set the text content of the specified node?
     ```

### 5. Instructor Review: DOM Manipulation (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points (:key:) below to review the following key points (‚úîÔ∏è ):

	* ‚úîÔ∏è `createElement()`

	* ‚úîÔ∏è `textContent`

	* ‚úîÔ∏è `setAttribute()`

	* ‚úîÔ∏è `appendChild()`

* Open `01-DOM-manipulation/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

	* Our `index.html` file is simply boilerplate HTML with a link to `script.js`:

	     ```html
	     <!DOCTYPE html>
	     <html lang="en">
	     	<head>
	     		<meta charset="UTF-8" />
	     		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
	     		<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
	     		<title>Look Ma No HTML</title>
	     	</head>
	     	<body>
	     		<script src="./assets/js/script.js"></script>
	     	</body>
	     </html>
	     ```

* Open `01-DOM-manipulation/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

	* We access the `<body>` element of `index.html` and store it in a variable, `body`, using `document.body`:

	     ```js
	     var body = document.body;
	     ```

	* üîë We create HTML elements by passing the element by name to `createElement()`&mdash;a method available to us in the `document` object&mdash;and storing the value in a variable. Here are all of the elements we had to create for this webpage:

	     ```js
	     var h1El = document.createElement('h1');
	     var h2El = document.createElement('h2');
	     var infoEl = document.createElement('div');
	     var imgEl = document.createElement('img');
	     var kittenEl = document.createElement('div');
	     var favoriteEl = document.createElement('div');
	     var listEl = document.createElement('ol');
	     var li1 = document.createElement('li');
	     var li2 = document.createElement('li');
	     var li3 = document.createElement('li');
	     var li4 = document.createElement('li');
	     ```

	* üîë We use `textContent` property on any of our variables to add text. Everyone's text will be different! Here is what I used:

	     ```js
	     h1El.textContent = 'Welcome to my page';
	     h2El.textContent =
	     'This HTML document was created using JavaScript and Chrome Dev Tools';
	     kittenEl.textContent = 'This is my kitten';
	     favoriteEl.textContent = 'My favorite foods are:';
	     li1.textContent = 'Chicken Fingers';
	     li2.textContent = 'Pizza';
	     li3.textContent = 'Burgers';
	     li4.textContent = 'Sushi';
	     ```

	* üîë Then, we use the `setAttribute()` method to add `style` and `src` attributes to our elements. Again, everyone's styling and image will be different, and that's fine!

	     ```js
	     h1El.setAttribute('style', 'margin:auto; width:50%; text-align:center;');
	     h2El.setAttribute('style', 'margin:auto; width:100%; text-align:center;');
	     infoEl.setAttribute('style', 'margin:auto; width:50%; text-align:center;');
	     imgEl.setAttribute('src', 'http://placekitten.com/200/300');
	     imgEl.setAttribute('height', 200);
	     imgEl.setAttribute('width', 200);
	     kittenEl.setAttribute('style', 'font-size:25px; text-align:center;');
	     favoriteEl.setAttribute('style', 'font-size:20px;');
       listEl.setAttribute('style', 'background: #888888; padding:20px;');
	     ```
	
	* üîë Finally, even though we _created_ the elements, we need to explicitly _append_ them to the DOM. We use the `appendChild()` method to do so.

	     ```js
	     body.appendChild(h1El);
	     body.appendChild(h2El);
	     body.appendChild(infoEl);
	     infoEl.appendChild(imgEl);
	     infoEl.appendChild(kittenEl);
	     body.appendChild(favoriteEl);
	     favoriteEl.appendChild(listEl);
	     listEl.appendChild(li1);
	     listEl.appendChild(li2);
	     listEl.appendChild(li3);
	     listEl.appendChild(li4);
	     ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

	* ‚òùÔ∏è Why do we first store `document.body` in a variable?

	* üôã We need to select at least one pre-existing element in the DOM to append child elements.

	* ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

	* üôã We can refer to the lesson plan, refer to the [MDN Web Docs on DOM manipulation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents), and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: addEventListener (5 min) 

* Open `02-addEventListener/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

	* üîë Selecting the Increment button increases the "Current count" by 1.

	* üîë Selecting the Increment button increases the "Current count" by 1. Our counter will not drop below zero.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

	* ‚òùÔ∏è Where have we used this before?

	* üôã We used this to add a todo item upon a button click in Lesson 1.

	* ‚òùÔ∏è How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

	* üôã If we want our web applications to be interactive, we need to handle events in the DOM.

	* ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?

	* üôã We would first scaffold a simple HTML document with two buttons and a header for the count. Then, in a `script.js` file, we would create a `count` variable for state, and create event handlers to listen for clicks on either of the buttons and update `count` accordingly. Lastly, we would update the header with the current count. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: addEventListener (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-addEventListener/README.md`, which is also shown here:

     ```md
     # addEventListener

          In this activity, you will create two buttons that will increment and decrement a counter when selected. 

     ## Instructions

     * Open [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) in your browser and monitor it as you work on this activity.

     * Open [script.js](Unsolved/assets/js/script.js) in your IDE and implement the following:

       * Create a counter to keep track of the current count

       * Create a function that will display the current count on the webpage

       * Create two event listeners with a callback function that increments or decrements the counter when the buttons are selected.

     ## Bonus

     * Add some code to ensure that the count never gets below 0.
     ```

### 8. Instructor Review: addEventListener (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points (:key:) below to review the following key points (‚úîÔ∏è ):

	* ‚úîÔ∏è `querySelector()`

	* ‚úîÔ∏è `.textContent`

	* ‚úîÔ∏è `addEventListener()`

* Open `02-addEventListener/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

	* We have a h1 header that displays the current count. Notice the `id` is called `"count"`.

	     ```html
	     <h1>Current count: <span id="count">0</span></h1>
	     ```

	* Next we have two buttons with the `"decrement"` and `"increment"` as their id.

	     ```html
	     <button id="decrement">Decrement</button>
	     <button id="increment">Increment</button>
	     ```

* Open `02-addEventListener/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

	* We first initialize our state variable, `count`, and set it to 0. 

	     ```js
	     var count = 0;
	     ```

	* üîë Then use the `querySelector()` method to select our count header, decrement button, and increment button by their respective ids.

	     ```js
	     var countEl = document.querySelector('#count');
	     var decrementEl = document.querySelector('#decrement');
	     var incrementEl = document.querySelector('#increment');
	     ```

	* üîë We create a function that sets the `textContent` of the count header to the current value in the `count` variable.

	     ```js
	     function setCounterText() {
		     countEl.textContent = count;
		     }
	     ```

	* üîë We use `addEventListener()` on our buttons to listen for "click" events. If there is a click event on either of the buttons, the `count` variable is incremented or decremented accordingly and the `setCounterText()` function is called.

	     ```js 
	     // Increments the count on click and calls setCounterText()
	     incrementEl.addEventListener('click', function() {
		     count++;
		     setCounterText();
	     });

	     // Decrements the count on click and calls setCounterText()
	     decrementEl.addEventListener('click', function() {
		     count--;
		     setCounterText();
	     });
	     ```

	* If you attempted the bonus, to prevent our count dropping below zero, we use a conditional statement to check if the value of `count` is greater than 0. Only if true, we decrement count and call the `setCounterText()` function.

	     ```js 
	     decrementEl.addEventListener("click", function() {
		     if(count > 0) {
			     count--;
			     setCounterText();
		     }
	     }); 
	     ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

	* ‚òùÔ∏è What is the difference between `querySelector()` and `getElementById()`?

	* üôã `getElementById()` only selects elements by id, where `querySelector()` will selects elements by class or id. With `getElementById()`, we don't need to specify it as an id with an octothorpe (#), but with `querySelector()` we need to specify whether the element is a class or an id. 

	* ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

	* üôã We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [MDN Web Docs on addEventListener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener), and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

	* ‚òùÔ∏è What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

	* üôã We reviewed creating HTML using DOM methods and listening for clicks on elements using `addEventListener()`.

	* ‚òùÔ∏è What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

	* üôã All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful. 

	* ‚òùÔ∏è Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

	* üôã It's important both to be fully prepared to start the Challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer. 

	* ‚òùÔ∏è Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

	* üôã We covered basic DOM manipulation along with `addEventListener()` in Lesson 1.

	* ‚òùÔ∏è What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Use student answers to transition to Office Hours.

### 10. Challenge Review (30 min)

* Take this time to help get students unblocked on the current Challenge that they are working through.

* Expect that students may ask for the following:

  * Further review on a particular subject

  * Debugging assistance

  * Help with computer issues

  * Guidance with a particular tool

### 11. Office Hours (30 min)

* Announce Office Hours and invite students to stay on the Zoom and work on the Challenge or their Module Project while they have live support from instructional staff.

### 12. End
