# Module 04 Instructor Overview: Web APIs

## Overview

In this module, students will learn about application programming interfaces (APIs). Students will use APIs to create dynamic, interactive web applications by sending and receiving data from other services like GitHub and IMDB. Students will also learn about APIs within the context of built-in browser objects and methods, specifically the document object model, or DOM.

In this week's virtual classes, you'll review DOM manipulation and traversal, event handling, timers, and `localStorage`.

## Overview of Asynchronous Material

Why are students learning Web APIs?

* Web APIs allow students to create dynamic web apps
* APIs allow students to interact with the DOM easier

Throughout the async module this week, students will use {MODULE TOPIC} to do the following:

* @TODO LIST HOW STUDENTS WILL USE ASYNC CONTENT IN THIS WEEK'S MODULE

**Reminder:** If students need help with an async activity, encourage them to attend Office Hours for help! If you can’t get through all of it, remind them that they can lean on Learning Assistants with the AskBCS bot for more help.

## Career Connection

During each lesson that students work through, they will also view a Career Connection section that will tie together the academic content with Career Services and how this material will be applicable to them in their future career.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Director and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careerservicesonlineevents.splashthat.com/).

If you'd like more information on Career Services, visit the [Career Services resources page](https://mycareerspot.org/).
