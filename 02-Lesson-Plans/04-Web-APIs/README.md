# Module 04 Instructor Overview: Web APIs

## Overview

In this week's virtual classes, you'll review DOM manipulation and traversal, event handling, timers and browser storage.

## Virtual Classes

[Recommended](./04.1-RECOMMENDED.md)

[Required](./04.2-REQUIRED.md)


## Instructor Notes

* This week's content will help students understand the purpose of JavaScript in front-end web development. But the DOM can be a challenging concept to immediately understand. Emphasize the role of objects in both the DOM and JavaScript to reinforce the connection and feel free to modify and improvise activities to demonstrate the dozens of methods and approaches available.

## Career Connection

During each lesson that students work through, they will also view a Career Connection section that will tie together the academic content with Career Services and how this material will be applicable to them in their future career.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Director and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careerservicesonlineevents.splashthat.com/).
