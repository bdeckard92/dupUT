## Virtual Classes

[Recommended](./04.1-RECOMMENDED.md)

[Required](./04.2-REQUIRED.md)


## Instructor Notes

* This week's content will help students understand the purpose of JavaScript in front-end web development. But the DOM can be a challenging concept to immediately understand. Emphasize the role of objects in both the DOM and JavaScript to reinforce the connection and feel free to modify and improvise activities to demonstrate the dozens of methods and approaches available.
