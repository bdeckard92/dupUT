# Module 04 Instructor Overview: Web APIs

## Overview

In this week's virtual classes, you'll review DOM manipulation and traversal, event handling, timers, and `localStorage`.

## Virtual Classes

If your class started **AFTER** January 1, 2021, use these lesson plans:

* [Virtual Class 04.1](./04.1-REQUIRED.md)

* [Virtual Class 04.2](./04.2-REQUIRED.md)

If your class started **BEFORE** January 1, 2021, use these lesson plans:

* [Virtual Class (Recommended) 04.1](./04.1-RECOMMENDED.md)

* [Virtual Class (Required) 04.2](./04.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* This week's content will help students understand the purpose of JavaScript in front-end web development. But the DOM can be a challenging concept to immediately understand. Emphasize the role of objects in both the DOM and JavaScript to reinforce the connection and feel free to modify and improvise activities to demonstrate the dozens of methods and approaches available.

* Students do not use timers in the module project, but they will need to use timers for the module Challenge. Be prepared to help the students if they have questions as they do the activity on timers. 

## Career Connection

During each lesson that students work through, they will also view a Career Connection section that will tie together the academic content with Career Services and how this material will be applicable to them in their future career.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Director and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careerservicesonlineevents.splashthat.com/).

## Heads-Up

Next week, you will review Bootstrap, jQuery, and Moment.js. If these are new or it's been awhile, you will want to find time to review and/or brush up prior to class.
