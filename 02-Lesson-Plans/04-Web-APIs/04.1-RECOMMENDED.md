## Class Instructions 

### 1. Introduction (5 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Direct students to post individual questions in the Zoom chat to be addressed by TAs and/or at the end of class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

    * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back and see what we accomplished, and acknowledge that it's a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic? 

    * 🙋 Let's do "fist to five" together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).


### 2. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

@TODO CHECK WITH THE LCA, LCE & CS POC


### 3. Instructor Demo: DOM Manipulation (5 min) 

* Open `01-Stu_DOM-manipulation/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 When we open our HTML file in the browser, we see a simple site.

    * 🔑 When we view the source of this site, we only see boilerplate HTML!

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
        <title>Look Ma No HTML</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <script src="./script.js"></script>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 @TODO We used this to accomplish { X, Y, Z }, in { CORRESPONDING ASYNCHRONOUS LESSON PLAN }.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We will need to dynamically generate HTML elements  

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We would first start by getting the `body` element then create and append elements to it. Lastly, we would set attributes on the elements to apply style and positioning.  

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 4. Student Do: DOM Manipulation (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-Stu_DOM-manipulation`.

```md
    # Look Ma! No HTML

    In this activity you are going to use DOM methods to create an entire HTML page.

    ## Instructions

    * You have been provided a standard HTML document. 

    * You may only work inside your `script.js`.

    * Inside `script.js` and using only DOM methods, create an entire HTML page. It should include:

    * A centered h1 with a centered h2 under it.

    * A centered image, with a center caption under it.

    * A list of your favorite foods (or some other list of favorites).

    * Some extra styling to all elements.
```


### 5. Instructor Review: DOM Manipulation (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ `createElement()`

    * ✔️ `textContent`

    * ✔️ `appendChild()`

    * ✔️ `setAttribute()`

    * ✔️ `getElementsByTagName()`

* Open `01-Stu_DOM-manipulation/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * Our `index.html` file is simply boilerplate HTML, with a link to `script.js`:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
        <title>Look Ma No HTML</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <script src="./script.js"></script>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

* Open `01-Stu_DOM-manipulation/Solved/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * We access the `<body>` element of `index.html` and store it in a variable, `body`, using `document.body`:

    ```js
    var body = document.body;

    ```

    * 🔑 We create HTML elements by passing the element by name to `createElement()`, a method available to us in the `document` object, and storing the value in a variable.

    ```js
    var h1El = document.createElement('h1');
    var h2El = document.createElement('h2');
    var infoEl = document.createElement('div');
    var imgEl = document.createElement('img');
    var kittenEl = document.createElement('div');
    var nameEl = document.createElement('div');
    var favoriteEl = document.createElement('div');
    var listEl = document.createElement('ol');
    var li1 = document.createElement('li');
    var li2 = document.createElement('li');
    var li3 = document.createElement('li');
    var li4 = document.createElement('li');
    ```

    * 🔑 We can also store reference to multiple elements in one variable using the `getElementsByTagName()` method.

    ```js
    var listItems = document.getElementsByTagName('li');
    ```

    * 🔑 We use `textContent` property on any of our variables to add text.

    ```js
    h1El.textContent = 'Welcome to my page';
    h2El.textContent =
    'This HTML document was created using JavaScript and Chrome Dev Tools';
    kittenEl.textContent = 'This is my kitten';
    nameEl.textContent = 'his name is Jax';
    favoriteEl.textContent = 'My favorite foods are:';
    li1.textContent = 'Chicken Fingers';
    li2.textContent = 'Pizza';
    li3.textContent = 'Burgers';
    li4.textContent = 'Sushi';
    ```

    * 🔑 Even though we _created_ the elements, we need to explicitly _append_ them to the DOM. We use the `appendChild()` method to do so.

    ```js
    body.appendChild(h1El);
    body.appendChild(h2El);
    body.appendChild(infoEl);
    infoEl.appendChild(imgEl);
    infoEl.appendChild(kittenEl);
    infoEl.appendChild(nameEl);
    body.appendChild(favoriteEl);
    favoriteEl.appendChild(listEl);
    listEl.appendChild(li1);
    listEl.appendChild(li2);
    listEl.appendChild(li3);
    listEl.appendChild(li4);
    ```

    * 🔑 Lastly, we use the `setAttribute` method to add `style` and `src` attributes to our elements.

    ```js
    h1El.setAttribute('style', 'margin:auto; width:50%; text-align:center;');
    h2El.setAttribute('style', 'margin:auto; width:100%; text-align:center;');
    infoEl.setAttribute('style', 'margin:auto; width:50%; text-align:center;');
    imgEl.setAttribute('src', 'http://placekitten.com/200/300');
    imgEl.setAttribute('height', 200);
    imgEl.setAttribute('width', 200);
    nameEl.setAttribute('style', 'font-size:25px; text-align:center;');
    kittenEl.setAttribute('style', 'font-size:25px; text-align:center;');
    favoriteEl.setAttribute('style', 'font-size:20px;');
    listEl.setAttribute('style', 'background:#333333; padding:20px;');
    listItems[0].setAttribute(
    'style',
    ' color:white; background: #666666; padding: 5px; margin-left: 35px;'
    );
    listItems[1].setAttribute(
    'style',
    ' color:white; background: #777777; padding: 5px; margin-left: 35px;'
    );
    listItems[2].setAttribute(
    'style',
    ' color:white; background: #888888; padding: 5px; margin-left: 35px;'
    );
    listItems[3].setAttribute(
    'style',
    ' color:white; background: #999999; padding: 5px; margin-left: 35px;'
    );
    ```

    * ☝️ @TODO { DO WE END OUR REVIEWS WITH A QUESTION? }

    * 🙋 @TODO { YES, WE DO! }

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understanding this?

    * 🙋 @TODO We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [{ DOCS }]({ URL }), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 6. Instructor Demo: addEventListener (5 min) 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to demonstrate the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ @TODO { THIS }

    * ✔️ @TODO { THAT }

    * ✔️ @TODO { THE OTHER }

@TODO USE THE FOLLOWING FOR BROWSER AND/OR COMMAND LINE DEMOS, RESPECTIVELY. REMOVE IF UNUSED

### 09. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

    * 🙋 We reviewed creating HTML using DOM methods and listening for clicks on elements using `addEventListener()`.

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful. 

    * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

    * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer. 

    * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

    * 🙋 @TODO { YES, WHERE? }

    * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Use student answers to transition to office hours.


### 10. Office Hours (30 min)

* Announce office hours and invite students to stay on the Zoom and start the challenge while they have live support from instructional staff.
