# Module 04 Virtual Class (Recommended): Web APIS

## Overview 

In today's recommended virtual class, students will review manipulation of the DOM and listening for click events, as well as solve a new algorithm in CodeSignal. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Solve the CodeSignal algorithm `countVowelConsonants`

* DOM manipulation

* Handle click events using `addEventListener()`

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try and anticipate questions students may have.

* In today's Career Connection, you will review the "Count Vowel Consonants" algorithm. If this is new to you or it's been awhile, you will want to review it prior to class. 

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* In the first lesson of the async material for this week, students are introduced to both basic DOM manipulation like `querySelector()`, `createElement()` and `appendChild()` along with `addEventListener()` when they are tasked with creating a new todo item upon a button click. They also update DOM element properties such as `className` and `textContent` in that lesson as well.

* Setting and reading attribute data is in Lesson 3 of this week's async material, as that is when students dynamically set and read values from a DOM element's attribute.

## Class Instructions 

### 1. Introduction (5 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Direct students to post individual questions in the Zoom chat to be addressed by TAs and/or at the end of class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

	* ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

	* 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back and see what we accomplished, and acknowledge that it's a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

	* ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic? 

	* 🙋 Let's do "fist to five" together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 2. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* [Click here for CodeSignal challenge](https://app.codesignal.com/public-test/YvSg9mctHApfLBuMH/qBHxbHRS4Yghf8) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

	* ☝️ What is a technical interview?

	* 🙋 The technical portion of the interview might be an in-person whiteboarding format, or it might be through an online assessment platform, such as HackerRank, to assess technical proficiency.

	* ☝️ How can we prepare for technical interviews?  

	* 🙋 Practice!

	* ☝️ Did anyone attempt the Code Signal algorithm? 

* Use student answers to transition to the next activity.

* Open your IDE and review the solution to the Code Signal algorithm: 
	
	* This algorithm is `countVowelConsonants`. We are given a string `s` that consists of only lowercase English letters. If vowels `('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u')` are given a value of `1` and consonants are given a value of `2,` return the sum of all of the letters in the input string.

	* For example, if `s = "a"`, the output should be `countVowelConsonant(s) = 1'

	* And if `s = "abcde"`, the output should be `countVowelConsonant(s) = 8`.

	* The instructions provide the following details regarding input and output:

	```md
	**[execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)**

	**[input] string s**
	A string consisting only of lowercase English letters.

	Guaranteed constraints:
	0 ≤ s.length ≤ 104.

	**[output] integer**
	```

	* We are also provided the following starter code: 

	```js
	function countVowelConsonant(s) {
			
	}
	```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

	* ☝️ What is the first step to solve this problem?

	* 🙋 In order to add values, we need to initialize a variable to assign the sum.

	```js
	var sum = 0;
	```

	* ☝️ How would we count the values of the letters in our string?

	* 🙋 We need to iterate over every letter in the string. We would do so by initializing a `for` loop.

	```js
	for (var i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
	```

	* ☝️  How would we check the value of each character in our string? 

	* 🙋 There are several approaches we could take, but one of the more efficient methods is to check the values of the vowels with a series of `OR` operators. If the character is equal to 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u', we add 1 to the value of `sum`. Otherwise, we add 2.

	```js
	if (s[i] === "a" || s[i] === "e" || s[i] === "i" || s[i] === "o" || s[i] === "u") {
		// increment sum by 1
		sum++;
		} else {
		// otherwise increment sum by 2
		sum = sum + 2;
		}
	}
	```

	* ☝️ What is the last thing we need to do? 

	* 🙋 We need to return `sum`!

	```js
	return sum;
	```

* Answer any questions students have before moving to the next activity.

### 3. Instructor Demo: DOM Manipulation (5 min) 

* Open `01-DOM-manipulation/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

	* 🔑 When we open our HTML file in the browser, we see a simple site with a header, a short description of the page, a photo with a caption, and a list of favorite foods.

	* 🔑 But when we open `index.html` in our IDE, we only see boilerplate HTML!

	```html
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html lang="en">
		<head>
			<meta charset="UTF-8" />
			<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
			<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
			<title>Look Ma No HTML</title>
		</head>
		<body>
			<script src="./assets/js/script.js"></script>
		</body>
	</html>
	```

	* Notice the `script.js` is loaded and that's where everything is being generated!

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used this to load up a JavaScript file and run JavaScript code in the browser in the first lesson of the module.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We will need to dynamically generate HTML elements.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We would first start by getting the `body` element then create and append elements to it. Lastly, we would set attributes on the elements to apply style and positioning.  

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: DOM Manipulation (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-DOM-manipulation/README.md`.

```md
# DOM manipulation

In this activity, you are going to use DOM methods to create an entire webpage.

## Instructions

* Open [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) in your browser and monitor it as you work on this activity.

* Open [script.js](Unsolved/assets/js/script.js) in your IDE and only work in this file!

* Using only DOM methods, create an entire HTML page. It should include:

  * A centered h1 with the title of the webpage
  
  * A centered h2 under it with a short description of the webpage.

  * A centered image with a centered caption under it.

  * A list of your favorite foods (or some other list of favorites).

* If you have some time left, add some extra styling to the elements.

## Hints

* What DOM methods allow you to create an HTML element, add an HTML element, and add a specified attribute to an HTML element?

* What property allows you to set the text content of the specified node?
```

### 5. Instructor Review: DOM Manipulation (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

	* ✔️ `createElement()`

	* ✔️ `textContent`

	* ✔️ `setAttribute()`

	* ✔️ `appendChild()`

* Open `01-DOM-manipulation/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

	* Our `index.html` file is simply boilerplate HTML, with a link to `script.js`:

	```html
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html lang="en">
		<head>
			<meta charset="UTF-8" />
			<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
			<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
			<title>Look Ma No HTML</title>
		</head>
		<body>
			<script src="./assets/js/script.js"></script>
		</body>
	</html>
	```

* Open `01-DOM-manipulation/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

	* We access the `<body>` element of `index.html` and store it in a variable, `body`, using `document.body`:

	```js
	var body = document.body;

	```

	* 🔑 We create HTML elements by passing the element by name to `createElement()`, a method available to us in the `document` object, and storing the value in a variable. Here are all of the elements we had to create for this webpage:

	```js
	var h1El = document.createElement('h1');
	var h2El = document.createElement('h2');
	var infoEl = document.createElement('div');
	var imgEl = document.createElement('img');
	var kittenEl = document.createElement('div');
	var favoriteEl = document.createElement('div');
	var listEl = document.createElement('ol');
	var li1 = document.createElement('li');
	var li2 = document.createElement('li');
	var li3 = document.createElement('li');
	var li4 = document.createElement('li');
	```

	* 🔑 We use `textContent` property on any of our variables to add text. Everyone's text will be different! Here is what I used:

	```js
	h1El.textContent = 'Welcome to my page';
	h2El.textContent =
	'This HTML document was created using JavaScript and Chrome Dev Tools';
	kittenEl.textContent = 'This is my kitten';
	favoriteEl.textContent = 'My favorite foods are:';
	li1.textContent = 'Chicken Fingers';
	li2.textContent = 'Pizza';
	li3.textContent = 'Burgers';
	li4.textContent = 'Sushi';
	```

	* 🔑 Then, we use the `setAttribute()` method to add `style` and `src` attributes to our elements. Again, everyone's styling and image will be different, and that's fine!

	```js
	h1El.setAttribute('style', 'margin:auto; width:50%; text-align:center;');
	h2El.setAttribute('style', 'margin:auto; width:100%; text-align:center;');
	infoEl.setAttribute('style', 'margin:auto; width:50%; text-align:center;');
	imgEl.setAttribute('src', 'http://placekitten.com/200/300');
	imgEl.setAttribute('height', 200);
	imgEl.setAttribute('width', 200);
	kittenEl.setAttribute('style', 'font-size:25px; text-align:center;');
	favoriteEl.setAttribute('style', 'font-size:20px;');
  listEl.setAttribute('style', 'background: #888888; padding:20px;');
	```
	* 🔑 Finally, even though we _created_ the elements, we need to explicitly _append_ them to the DOM. We use the `appendChild()` method to do so.

	```js
	body.appendChild(h1El);
	body.appendChild(h2El);
	body.appendChild(infoEl);
	infoEl.appendChild(imgEl);
	infoEl.appendChild(kittenEl);
	body.appendChild(favoriteEl);
	favoriteEl.appendChild(listEl);
	listEl.appendChild(li1);
	listEl.appendChild(li2);
	listEl.appendChild(li3);
	listEl.appendChild(li4);
	```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

	* ☝️ Why do we first store `document.body` in a variable?

	* 🙋 We need to select at least one pre-existing element in the DOM to append child elements.

	* ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understanding this?

	* 🙋 We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [MDN Web Docs on DOM manipulation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: addEventListener (5 min) 

* Open `02-addEventListener/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

	* 🔑 Selecting the "Increment" button increases the "Current count" by 1.

	* 🔑 Selecting the "Increment" button increases the "Current count" by 1. Our counter will not drop below zero.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

	* ☝️ Where have we used this before?

	* 🙋 We used this to add a todo item upon a button click in the first lesson of the module.

	* ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

	* 🙋 In order for our web applications to be interactive, we need to handle events in the DOM.

	* ☝️ How would we build this?

	* 🙋 We would first scaffold a simple HTML document with two buttons and a header for the count. Then, in a `script.js` file, we would create a `count` variable for state and create event handlers to listen for clicks on either of the buttons and update `count` accordingly. Lastly, we would update the header with the current count. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: addEventListener (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-addEventListener/README.md`.

```md
# addEventListener

In this activity, you will create two buttons that will increment and decrement a counter when selected. 

## Instructions

* Open [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) in your browser and monitor it as you work on this activity.

* Open [script.js](Unsolved/assets/js/script.js) in your IDE and implement the following:

  * Create a counter to keep track of the current count

  * Create a function that will display the current count on the webpage

  * Create two event listeners with a callback function that increments or decrements the counter when the buttons are selected.

## Bonus

* Add some code to ensure that the count never gets below 0.
```

### 8. Instructor Review: addEventListener (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

	* ✔️ `querySelector()`

	* ✔️ `.textContent`

	* ✔️ `addEventListener()`

* Open `02-addEventListener/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

	* We have a h1 header that displays the current count. Notice the `id` is called "count"

	```html
	<h1>Current count: <span id="count">0</span></h1>
	```

	* Next we have two buttons with the `id`s "decrement" and "increment"

	```html
	<button id="decrement">Decrement</button>
	<button id="increment">Increment</button>
	```

* Open `02-addEventListener/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

	* We first initialize our state variable, `count`, and set it to 0. 

	```js
	var count = 0;
	```

	* 🔑 Then use the `querySelector()` method to select our count header, decrement button, and increment button by their respective `id`s.

	```js
	var countEl = document.querySelector('#count');
	var decrementEl = document.querySelector('#decrement');
	var incrementEl = document.querySelector('#increment');
	```

	* 🔑 We create a function which sets the `textContent` of the count header to the current value in the `count` variable.

	```js
	function setCounterText() {
		countEl.textContent = count;
		}
	```

	* 🔑 We use `addEventListener()` on our buttons to listen for "click" events. If there is a click event on either of the buttons, the `count` variable is incremented or decremented accordingly and the `setCounterText()` function is called

	```js 
	// Increments the count on click and calls setCounterText()
	incrementEl.addEventListener('click', function() {
		count++;
		setCounterText();
	});

	// Decrements the count on click and calls setCounterText()
	decrementEl.addEventListener('click', function() {
		count--;
		setCounterText();
	});
	```

	* If you attempted the bonus, to prevent our count dropping below zero, we use a conditional statement to check if the value of `count` is greater than 0. Only if true, we decrement count and call the `setCounterText()` function.

	```js 
	decrementEl.addEventListener("click", function() {
		if(count > 0) {
			count--;
			setCounterText();
		}
	}); 
	```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

	* ☝️ What is the difference between `querySelector()` and `getElementById()`?

	* 🙋 `getElementById()` only selects elements by id, where `querySelector()` will selects elements by class or id. With `getElementById()`, we don't need to specify it as an id with an octothorpe (#), but with `querySelector()` we need to specify whether the element is a class or an id. 

	* ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understanding this?

	* 🙋 We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [MDN Web Docs on addEventListener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 09. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

	* ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

	* 🙋 We reviewed creating HTML using DOM methods and listening for clicks on elements using `addEventListener()`.

	* ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

	* 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful. 

	* ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

	* 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer. 

	* ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

	* 🙋 We covered basic DOM manipulation along with `addEventListener()` in Lesson 1.

	* ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Use student answers to transition to Office Hours.

### 10. Office Hours (30 min)

* Announce Office Hours and invite students to stay on the Zoom and start the challenge while they have live support from instructional staff. 

### 11. End
