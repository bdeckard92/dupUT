## Class Instructions 

### 1. Introduction (5 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Direct students to post individual questions in the Zoom chat to be addressed by TAs and/or at the end of class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

    * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back and see what we accomplished, and acknowledge that it's a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic? 

    * 🙋 Let's do "fist to five" together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).


### 2. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

@TODO CHECK WITH THE LCA, LCE & CS POC


### 3. Instructor Demo: Creating HTML (5 min) 

* Open `@TODO/folder/file` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 When we open our HTML file in the browser, we see a simple site.

    * 🔑 When we view the source of this site, we only see boilerplate HTML!

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
        <title>Look Ma No HTML</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <script src="./script.js"></script>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 @TODO We used this to accomplish { X, Y, Z }, in { CORRESPONDING ASYNCHRONOUS LESSON PLAN }.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We will need to dynamically generate HTML elements  

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We would first start by getting the `body` element then create and append elements to it. Lastly, we would set attributes on the elements to apply style and positioning.  

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 4. Student Do: Creating HTML (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `@TODO/folder/file`.

```md
    # Look Ma! No HTML

    In this activity you are going to use DOM methods to create an entire HTML page.

    ## Instructions

    * You have been provided a standard HTML document. 

    * You may only work inside your `script.js`.

    * Inside `script.js` and using only DOM methods, create an entire HTML page. It should include:

    * A centered h1 with a centered h2 under it.

    * A centered image, with a center caption under it.

    * A list of your favorite foods (or some other list of favorites).

    * Some extra styling to all elements.
```


### 5. Instructor Review: Creating HTML (10 min)

    </head>
    <body>
        <script src="./script.js"></script>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

* Open `01-Stu_Create-HTML/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 

    ```js
    var body = document.body;

    ```

    * 🔑 @TODO DON'T FORGET TO USE THE KEY EMOJI ON KEY POINTS, BUT ONLY KEY POINTS, NOT _EVERY_ POINT

    ```js
    var h1El = document.createElement('h1');
    var h2El = document.createElement('h2');
    var infoEl = document.createElement('div');
    var imgEl = document.createElement('img');
    var kittenEl = document.createElement('div');

    var li2 = document.createElement('li');
    var li3 = document.createElement('li');
    var li4 = document.createElement('li');
    ```

    * 

    ```js
    var listItems = document.getElementsByTagName('li');
    ```

    * 

    ```js
    h1El.textContent = 'Welcome to my page';
    h2El.textContent =
    'This HTML document was created using JavaScript and Chrome Dev Tools';
    kittenEl.textContent = 'This is my kitten';
    nameEl.textContent = 'his name is Jax';
    favoriteEl.textContent = 'My favorite foods are:';

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

    * 🙋 We reviewed creating HTML using DOM methods and listening for clicks on elements using `addEventListener()`.

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful. 

    * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

    * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer. 

    * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

    * 🙋 @TODO { YES, WHERE? }

    * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Use student answers to transition to office hours.
