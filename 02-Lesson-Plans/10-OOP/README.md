# Module 10 Instructor Overview: Object-Oriented Programming

## Overview

In this week's virtual classes, you'll review constructor functions, the `this` keyword, prototypes, ES6 Classes, and TDD.

## Virtual Classes

[Recommended](./10.1-RECOMMENDED.md)

[Required](./10.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* Students will use `jest` for unit testing. Familiarize yourself with it if you've never used it before.

* Let your students know that this module is very concept-heavy! Object-oriented programming can be very difficult to understand at first, but it is crucial in making them employer-competitive. So reassure them that they are not alone in struggling with this topic and that it is perfectly normal to feel a little lost at first. 

* At the same time, do not feel discouraged if your students aren't understanding the concept after you've tried explaining it to them. It takes time to fully grasp object-oriented programming, so keep encouraging your students and reassuring them that with time and practice, they will understand this! If you are comfortable doing so, share your own struggle and/or personal experiences learning and working with OOP.

## Career Connection

During each lesson that students work through, they will also view a Career Connection section that will tie together the academic content with Career Services and how this material will be applicable to them in their future career.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Director and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careerservicesonlineevents.splashthat.com/).

## Heads Up

* Next week you will introduce Express.js to use in the back-end of an application. 

* You will use a tool called [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) to test APIs, so make sure to have it installed on your machine and be familiar with using it.
