# Module 10 Instructor Overview: Object-Oriented Programming

## Overview

In this module, students will learn about one of the most important programming paradigms, **object-oriented programming (OOP)**. Students will also learn how to write tests before writing code, a practice called **test-driven development (TDD)**.

In this week's virtual classes, you'll review constructor functions, the `this` keyword, prototypes, ES6 Classes, and TDD.

| Day  | Topic              | Location      |
| ---  | ---                | ---           |
| 1    | Constructors       | 10.1          |
| 1    | Mini-Bank          | 10.1          |
| 2    | Prototypes         | 10.2          |
| 2    | Classes            | 10.5          |
| 2    | TDD                | 10.1, 10.2    |

## Overview of Asynchronous Material 

Why are students learning OOP and TDD?

  * Object-oriented programming principles are language-agnostic and help prepare students to learn other in-demand languages, such as Java and C++.

  * Test-driven development is a programming paradigm that helps developers write leaner, more predictable code. 

  * Being able to write object-oriented JavaScript and test this code effectively is an important skill set to demonstrate to prospective employers.

Throughout the async module this week, students will use OOP and TDD to do the following:

  * Integrate constructor functions into their applications, adding structure to their code and reducing the amount of code that must be written.

  * Build entire applications using OOP, separating data and functionality into distinct constructor functions.

  * Verify that their code works as intended by using automated tests.

  * Build applications using test-driven development, writing tests before implementing functionality.

  * Implement more advanced OOP patterns, like inheritance, using modern ES6 class syntax.

  * Create more scalable applications that follow the OOP paradigm.

**Reminder**: If students need help with an async activity, encourage them to attend Office Hours for help! If you can’t get through all of it, remind them that they can lean on Learning Assistants with the AskBCS bot for more help.

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to review the activities before class. Try to anticipate any questions that students might have.

* Students will use Jest for unit testing. Familiarize yourself with it if you've never used it before. To learn more, refer to the [Jest website](https://jestjs.io/).

* Student will also use ES6 classes. If you need a refresher, refer to the [MDN Web Docs on classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes). 

* Warn your students know that this module is very concept-heavy! Object-oriented programming can be difficult at first, but understanding it is crucial in becoming employer-competitive. Reassure students that they aren't alone in struggling with this topic; it's perfectly normal to feel a little lost at first.

* Likewise, don't feel discouraged if your students don't immediately understand object-oriented programming, even after you've tried to explain it. It takes time to fully grasp the concept, so keep encouraging your students and reassuring them that they'll understand it with time and practice! If you're comfortable doing so, share your own experiences or struggles learning and working with OOP.

### Common Pain Points

According to our class data, students might experience some of the following pain points throughout the week:

| Pain Point                | Recommendation       |
| ---                       | ---                  |
| Understanding OOP         | Refer to [MDN Web Docs on object-oriented JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object-oriented_JS) |
| Implementing unit tests   | Refer to Lesson 1 or the [Jest documentation on getting started](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) |
| ES6 classes               | Refer to Lesson 5 or the [MDN Web Docs on classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)|

## Career Connection

During each lesson that students work through, they will also view a Career Connection section that will tie together the academic content with career services and how this material will be applicable to them in their future career.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Coach and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careerservicesonlineevents.splashthat.com/).

If you'd like more information on career services, visit the [career services resources page](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/fullstack-prework/pull/80/).

## Module Challenge

This week students will build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Because testing is key to making code maintainable, students will also write unit tests for each part of their code and ensure that every test is passed.

[Module 10 Challenge](../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/02-Challenge)

Specific skills students will need to implement in order to be successful:

* Implement inheritance between classes using modern ES6 class syntax.

* Verify that the code works as intended through automated tests using the [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) framework.

* Apply user input and dynamically generate an entire HTML page directly from the command line using template literals.

* Implement the [npm package Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) to provide a command-line user interface and the inquiry session flow.

## Heads-Up

* Next week you'll introduce [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), a flexible Node.js web application framework to provide server-side logic to web applications. 

* You'll use a tool called [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/products/insomnia) to test APIs, so make sure to install it on your machine and be familiar with using it.
