[Required](./10.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* Students will use `jest` for unit testing. Familiarize yourself with it if you've never used it before.

## Heads Up

* Next week you will introduce Express.js to use in the back-end of an application.
