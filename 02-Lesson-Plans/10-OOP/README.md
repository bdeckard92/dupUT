# Module 10 Instructor Overview: Object-Oriented Programming

## Overview

In this module, students will learn about an important programming paradigm: object-oriented programming (OOP). They will also learn how to write tests before writing code, a practice known as test-driven development (TDD).

In this week's virtual classes, you'll discuss TDD, mocking using Jest, and ES6 classes.

The following table maps the key topics covered in the virtual lessons to where they are taught in the asynchronous content:

| Day  | Topic              | Location |
| ---  | ---                | ---      |
| 1    | TDD                | 10.1     |
| 1    | Passing tests      | 10.1     |
| 1    | Git Guide          | n/a      |
| 2    | Mocking            | 10.2     |
| 2    | Classes            | 10.5     |
| 2    | Multiple classes   | 10.5     |

## Overview of Asynchronous Material

This week in the asynchronous content, students are introduced to OOP and TDD, which are important for the following reasons:

* OOP principles are language-agnostic and help prepare students to learn other in-demand languages, such as Java and C++.

* TDD is a programming paradigm that helps developers write leaner, more predictable code.

* Being able to write object-oriented JavaScript and test that code effectively is an important skill to demonstrate to prospective employers.

Throughout the async module this week, students will use OOP and TDD to do the following:

* Integrate constructor functions into their applications, adding structure to their code, and reducing the amount of code that must be written.

* Build entire applications using OOP, separating data and functionality into distinct constructor functions.

* Verify that their code works as intended by using automated tests.

* Build applications using TDD, which means writing tests before implementing functionality.

* Implement more advanced OOP patterns, like inheritance, using modern ES6 class syntax.

* Create more scalable applications that follow the OOP paradigm.

**Reminder**: If students need help with an async activity, encourage them to attend Office Hours. If they need more help, remind them that they can use Learning Assistants via the AskBCS bot.

## Virtual Classes

Here are the lesson plans for this week's virtual classes:

* [10.1 Virtual Class](./10.1-REQUIRED.md)

* [10.2 Virtual Class](./10.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to review the activities before class. Try to anticipate any questions that students might have.

* Students will use Jest for unit testing. Familiarize yourself with it if you've never used it before. To learn more, refer to the [Jest website](https://jestjs.io/).

* Student will also use ES6 classes. If you need a refresher, refer to the [MDN Web Docs on classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes).

* Warn your students know that this module is very concept-heavy! Object-oriented programming can be difficult at first, but understanding it is crucial in becoming employer-competitive. Reassure students that they aren't alone in struggling with this topic; it's perfectly normal to feel a little lost at first.

* Likewise, don't feel discouraged if your students don't immediately understand object-oriented programming, even after you've tried to explain it. It takes time to fully grasp the concept, so keep encouraging your students and reassuring them that they'll understand it with time and practice! If you're comfortable doing so, share your own experiences or struggles learning and working with OOP.

* Students will use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit testing. Familiarize yourself with it if you've never used it before.

* Student will also use ES6 classes. If you need a refresher, [MDN Web Docs on classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) provides a great overview of key concepts.

### Common Pain Points

According to our class data, students might experience some of the following pain points throughout the week:

| Pain Point                | Recommendation       |
| ---                       | ---                  |
| Understanding OOP         | Refer to the [MDN Web Docs on object-oriented JavaScript for beginners](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object-oriented_JS) |
| Implementing unit tests   | Refer to Lesson 1 or the [Jest Documentation on getting started](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) |
| ES6 classes               | Refer to Lesson 5 or the [MDN Web Docs on classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)|

## Career Connection

The first virtual class of the week contains a Career Connection section, which links the current module's coursework with career services and students' future careers. During this section, it can be helpful to share examples of how you've used these skills and tools in your professional life.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Coach and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp).

If you'd like more information on career services, visit the [career services resources page](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp).

## Module Challenge

For the [Module 10 Challenge](../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/02-Challenge), students will build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Because testing is key to making code maintainable, students will also write unit tests for each part of their code and ensure that it passes all of them.

Students will need to use the following skills in order to be successful at the Challenge:

* Use modern ES6 class syntax to implement inheritance between classes.

* Verify that the code works as intended through automated tests using the [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) framework.

* Take user input and use template literals to dynamically generate an entire HTML page directly from the command line.

* Implement the [Inquirer npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) to provide a command-line user interface and the inquiry session flow.

## Heads-Up

* Next week, you will introduce [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), a flexible Node.js web application framework to provide server-side logic to web applications.

* The next module will introduce students to Express.js and creating server-side routes. To test these routes, students will use an app called Insomnia. Be sure to have Insomnia installed on your computer before class. To install, visit the [Insomnia installation page](https://insomnia.rest/download).

* Students will also start using Heroku to host their web applications in the next unit. Be sure to install the Heroku CLI on your computer. For extra guidance, you can follow the [Heroku CLI installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/heroku/how-to-install-the-heroku-cli).
