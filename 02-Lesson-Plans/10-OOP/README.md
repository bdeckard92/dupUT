# Module 10 Instructor Overview: Object-Oriented Programming

## Overview

In this module, students will learn about one of the most important programming paradigms, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Students will also learn how to write tests before writing code, a practice known as Test Driven Development (TDD).

In this week's virtual classes, you'll discuss Test Driven Development, mocking using Jest, and ES6 Classes.

| Day  | Topic              | Location |
| ---  | ---                | ---      |
| 1    | TDD                | 10.1     |
| 1    | Passing Tests      | 10.1     |
| 2    | Mocking            | 10.2     |
| 2    | Classes            | 10.5     |
| 2    | Multiple Classes   | 10.5     |

## Overview of Asynchronous Material 

Why are students learning OOP and TDD?

  * Object-oriented programming principles are language-agnostic and help prepare students to learn other in-demand languages such as Java and C++.

  * Test Driven Development is a programming paradigm that helps developers write leaner, more predictable code. 

  * Being able to write JavaScript in an object-oriented manner and test this code effectively is an important skill set to demonstrate to prospective employers.

Throughout the async module this week, students will use OOP and TDD to do the following:

  * Integrate constructor functions into their applications, adding structure to their code and reducing the amount of code that must be written.

  * Build entire applications using OOP, separating data and functionality into distinct constructor functions that can be composed together.

  * Verify that their code works as intended by using automated tests.

  * Build applications using test-driven development, writing tests before implementing functionality.

  * Use modern ES6 class syntax to implement more advanced OOP patterns, like inheritance.

  * Create more scalable applications that follow the OOP paradigm.

**Reminder:** If students need help with an async activity, encourage them to attend Office Hours for help! If you can’t get through all of it, remind them that they can lean on Learning Assistants with the AskBCS bot for more help.

## Virtual Classes

If your class started AFTER January 1, 2021, use these lesson plans:

* [Virtual Class 10.1](./10.1-REQUIRED.md)

* [Virtual Class 10.2](./10.2-REQUIRED.md)

If your class started BEFORE January 1, 2021, use these lesson plans:

* [Virtual Class (Recommended) 10.1](./10.1-RECOMMENDED.md)

* [Virtual Class (Required) 10.2](./10.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* Students will use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit testing. Familiarize yourself with it if you've never used it before.

* Student will also use ES6 Classes. If you need a refresher, [MDN Web Docs on Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) provides a great overview of key concepts. 

* Let your students know that this module is very concept-heavy! Object-oriented programming can be very difficult to understand at first, but it is crucial in making them employer-competitive. So reassure them that they are not alone in struggling with this topic and that it is perfectly normal to feel a little lost at first. 

* At the same time, do not feel discouraged if your students aren't understanding the concept after you've tried explaining it to them. It takes time to fully grasp object-oriented programming, so keep encouraging your students and reassuring them that with time and practice, they will understand this! If you are comfortable doing so, share your own struggle and/or personal experiences learning and working with OOP.

### Common Pain Points

According to our class data, students might experience some of the following pain points throughout the week:

| Pain Point                | Recommendation       |
| ---                       | ---                  |
| Understanding OOP         | Refer to [MDN Web Docs on Object-oriented JavaScript for beginners](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object-oriented_JS) |
| Implementing unit tests   | Refer to Lesson 1 or the [Jest Documentation on Getting Started](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) |
| ES6 Classes               | Refer to Lesson 5 or the [MDN Web Docs on Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)|

## Career Connection

During each lesson that students work through, they will also view a Career Connection section that will tie together the academic content with Career Services and how this material will be applicable to them in their future career.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Director and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careerservicesonlineevents.splashthat.com/).

If you'd like more information on Career Services, visit the [Career Services resources page](https://mycareerspot.org/).

## Module Challenge

This week students will build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Because testing is key to making code maintainable, students will also write unit tests for each part of their code and ensure that it passes all of them.

[Module 10 Challenge](../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/02-Challenge)

Specific skills students will need to implement in order to be successful:

* Use modern ES6 class syntax to implement inheritance between classes.

* Verify that the code works as intended through automated tests using the [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) framework.

* Take user input and use template literals to dynamically generate an entire HTML page directly from the command line.

* Implement the [Inquirer NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) to provide a command line user interface and the inquiry session flow.

## Heads-Up

* Next week you will introduce [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), a flexible Node.js web application framework to provide server-side logic to web applications. 

* You will use a tool called [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/products/insomnia) to test APIs, so make sure to have it installed on your machine and be familiar with using it.
