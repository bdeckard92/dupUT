## Class Instructions 

### 1. Introduction (5 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Direct students to post individual questions in the Zoom chat to be addressed by TAs and/or at the end of class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

    * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back and see what we accomplished, and acknowledge that it's a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic? 

    * 🙋 Let's do "fist to five" together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).


### 2. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

@TODO CHECK WITH THE LCA, LCE & CS POC


### 3. Instructor Demo: Constructor Function (5 min) 

* Navigate to `01-Constructor-Function/Solved/` in your command line and run `node catsDogs.js` and demonstrate the following: 

    * 🔑 We see "Woof!" in the console.

* Open `01-Constructor-Function/Unsolved/catsDogs.js` in your IDE and explain following: 

    * 🔑 If you create a constructor function properly, the `dog` and `cat` objects will be created and when `makeNoise()` is called, only the dog will "Woof!" in the console.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used a constructor function to create potions for the RPG in Lesson 1.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 @TODO { YES, HOW? } 

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We need to create a constructor function that will make different animal objects with various properties and methods.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 4. Student Do: Constructor Function (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-Constructor-Function/README.md`.

    ```md
    # Constructor Function

    In this activity, you will create a constructor function. 

    ## Instructions

    * Open [Unsolved/catsDogs.js](Unsolved/catsDogs.js) and create a constructor function called `Animal`.

    * The constructor function will take in two parameters, `raining` and `noise`. These will be passed into the keys as their value. 

    * Create a third key that will be a function called `makeNoise()`. The function checks if the `raining` key's value is `true`. If it is, it will log the value of the key's `noise` in the console. 

    ## Bonus

    * How can we make the cat make noise? In other words, how can we change the value of `raining` for the `cat` object after it has been created? 
    ```


### 5. Instructor Review: Constructor Function (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ `raining` and `noise` parameters

    * ✔️ `makeNoise()`

* Open `01-Constructor-Function/Solved/catsDogs.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 We create a constructor function called `Animal` that takes in two parameters, `raining` and `noise`

    ```js
    function Animal(raining, noise) {
    ```

    * 🔑 These parameters are passed into the keys as their value.

    ```js
    this.raining = raining;
    this.noise = noise;
    ```

    * 🔑 The third key is a function called `makeNoise()`. The function checks if the `raining` key's value is `true`. If it is, it will log the value of the key's `noise` in the console.

    ```js
    this.makeNoise = function() {
      if (this.raining === true) {
        console.log(this.noise);
      }
    };
    ```

    * When we run `node catsDogs.js` in the console, the `dog` and `cat` objects are created and the `makeNoise()` method is called on them

    ```js
    let dog = new Animal(true, "Woof!");
    let cat = new Animal(false, "Meow!");

    dog.makeNoise();
    cat.makeNoise();
    ```

    * Only the `dog`'s "Woof!" will be logged in the console since its `raining` value is set to `true`. 
    
    * However, for the bonus, we can set the `cat`'s `raining` value to `true` and call the `makeNoise()` method to make it "Meow!" in the console.

    ```js
    cat.raining = true;
    cat.makeNoise();
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How are constructors useful?

    * 🙋 They allow us to create as many objects as we want, all from a single blueprint. This lessens redundant code.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understanding this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 1, read this article on [Understanding JavaScript Constructors](https://css-tricks.com/understanding-javascript-constructors/) by Faraz Kelhini, and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 6. Instructor Demo: Mini-Bank (5 min) 

* Navigate to `02-Mini-Bank/Solved/` in your command line and run `node minibank.js` and demonstrate the following: 

    * 🔑 We can see that our starting balance is 0.

    * 🔑 Then we deposited 85 so the balance is 85.

    * 🔑 Then we withdrew 20 so the balance is 65.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used the constructors and the `this` keyword in our RPG

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 @TODO { YES, HOW? } 

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 @TODO { YES, HOW? } 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 7. Student Do: { ACTIVITY NAME } (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `@TODO/folder/file`.

```md
    @TODO ADD INSTRUCTIONS; TABBED
```


### 8. Instructor Review: { ACTIVITY NAME } (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ @TODO { THIS }

    * ✔️ @TODO { THAT }

    * ✔️ @TODO { THE OTHER }

* Open `@TODO/folder/file` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * @TODO { WE DO THIS AND THE RESULT IS THAT }

    ```
    @TODO ADD CODE SNIPPET, TABBED
    ```

    * 🔑 @TODO DON'T FORGET TO USE THE KEY EMOJI ON KEY POINTS, BUT ONLY KEY POINTS, NOT _EVERY_ POINT

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ @TODO { DO WE END OUR REVIEWS WITH A QUESTION? }

    * 🙋 @TODO { YES, WE DO! }

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understanding this?

    * 🙋 @TODO We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [{ DOCS }]({ URL }), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 09. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

    * 🙋 @TODO { YES, WHAT? }

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful. 

    * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

    * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer. 

    * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

    * 🙋 @TODO { YES, WHERE? }

    * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Use student answers to transition to office hours.


### 10. Office Hours (30 min)

* Announce office hours and invite students to stay on the Zoom and start the challenge while they have live support from instructional staff.
