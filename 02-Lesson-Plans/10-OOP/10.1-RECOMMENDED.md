# Module 10 Virtual Class (Recommended): Object-Oriented Programming

## Overview 

In today's recommended virtual class, students will review constructor functions and the keyword `this`, as well as solve a new algorithm in CodeSignal. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Solve the CodeSignal algorithm `nextPrime`

* Create a constructor function

* Utilize the `this` keyword 

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* Students used the constructor function and `this` in Lesson 1.

## Class Instructions 

### 1. Introduction (5 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Direct students to post individual questions in the Zoom chat to be addressed by TAs and/or at the end of class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

    * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back and see what we accomplished, and acknowledge that it's a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic? 

    * 🙋 Let's do "fist to five" together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).


### 2. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* [Click here for CodeSignal challenge](https://app.codesignal.com/public-test/7wsdGsoYtdM8narY9/j2q8xRbzqXKT8k) 

* Remind students that practicing algorithm-based interview questions is one of the best ways to prep for interviews because:

    * companies often use algorithm questions to test candidates knowledge, despite not using these kinds of algorithms every day

    * it is great practice to learn new JavaScript methods and to solidify knowledge

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Did anyone attempt the Code Signal algorithm?

    * 🙋 It is encouraged to take advantage of the CodeSignal practice because it reflects real-world online interviewing.

* Open your IDE and review the solution to the CodeSignal algorithm:

    * The algorithm is called `nextPrime`. We are given a number, `n` and are asked to find the next smallest prime number that is greater than the given `n`.

    * If needed, clarify for students what constitutes a prime number: 

    > A positive integer that cannot be formed by multiplying together two smaller positive integers. In other words, it's a number n > 1 that can only be evenly divided by 1 and n itself.
    > Examples:
    > 5 is prime
    > 2 is prime
    > 6 is composite (not prime) because 2 × 3 = 6
    > 49 is composite (not prime) because 7 × 7 = 49

    * For sequence `n = 7`, the output should be `11`.

    * For sequence `n = 12`, the output should be `13`.

    * The instructions provide the following details regarding input and output:

    ```md
    [execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)

    [input] integer n

    A positive integer.

    Guaranteed constraints:
    1 ≤ n ≤ 107.

    [output] integer
    ```

    * We are also provided the following starter code:

    ```js
    function nextPrime(n) {

    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝) and call on students for answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What is the first step to solve this problem?

    * 🙋 We are going to need a loop that starts at the next value after `n` and continues to increment until we find a prime number. 

    * ☝ Exactly! So we could start by setting up a `for` loop that does this. We're actually going to omit the condition of the `for` loop. We are just going to ask the `for` loop to start at `n+1` and continue to increment with `i++` but there's no `i <` something. Note the double `;;`. 

    ```js
    for(let i = n + 1;; i++) {

    }
    ```

    * ☝ So once we have this set up, what are your next steps to solving this problem?

    * 🙋 A variable to hold whether the current number being assessed is prime or not!

    * ☝ Great, so we can do that easily with `let isPrime = true`, assuming that the number is prime. And then we can assess whether this is actually true, and if it is, return it. If it's not, then we move on to the next number. We can do this using another loop inside of our current loop:

    ```js
    for (let d = 2; d * d <= i; d++) {
        if (i % d === 0) {
            isPrime = false;
            break;
        }
    }
    if (isPrime) {
        return i;
    }
    ```

    * 🙋 We'll also need a loop that goes through the input array as many times as the value of `n` and grabs the first item in the array and moves it to the end. 

    * ☝ Exactly. Let's take a look at how to do that. In this code, we remove the first item of the array, and store it in a temporary variable `first`, and then use the `.push()` method to take that variable and _push_ it on to the end of the array.

    ```js
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        let first = temp.shift();
        temp.push(first);
    }
    ```

    * ☝ And don't forget we need to return the value at the end with `return temp`. And with that, we're all done!

* Full solution:

```js
function arrayRotation(arr, n) {
    let temp = arr.slice(0);

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        let first = temp.shift();

        temp.push(first);
    }

    return temp;
}
```

* Answer any questions students have before moving to the next activity.

### 3. Instructor Demo: Constructor Function (5 min) 

* Navigate to `01-Constructor-Function/Solved/` in your command line and run `node catsDogs.js` to demonstrate the following: 

    * 🔑 We see "Woof!" in the console.

* Open `01-Constructor-Function/Unsolved/catsDogs.js` in your IDE and explain following: 

    * 🔑 If you create a constructor function properly, the `dog` and `cat` objects will be created and when `makeNoise()` is called, only the dog will "Woof!" in the console.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used a constructor function to create potions for the RPG in Lesson 1.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 Although we won't directly use constructor functions in the upcoming challenge, we will use ES6 Classes. Classes function in a similar way to constructors. We will use classes to create `Employee`, `Manager`, `Engineer`, and `Intern` objects with various properties. 

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We need to create a constructor function that will make different `Animal` objects with various properties and methods.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 4. Student Do: Constructor Function (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-Constructor-Function/README.md`.

    ```md
    # Constructor Function

    In this activity, you will create a constructor function. 

    ## Instructions

    * Open [Unsolved/catsDogs.js](Unsolved/catsDogs.js) and create a constructor function called `Animal`.

    * The constructor function will take in two parameters, `raining` and `noise`. These will be passed into the keys as their value. 

    * Create a third key that will be a function called `makeNoise()`. The function checks if the `raining` key's value is `true`. If it is, it will log the value of the key's `noise` in the console. 

    ## Bonus

    * How can we make the cat make noise? In other words, how can we change the value of `raining` for the `cat` object after it has been created? 
    ```


### 5. Instructor Review: Constructor Function (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ `raining` and `noise` parameters

    * ✔️ `makeNoise()`

* Open `01-Constructor-Function/Solved/catsDogs.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 We create a constructor function called `Animal` that takes in two parameters, `raining` and `noise`

    ```js
    function Animal(raining, noise) {
    ```

    * 🔑 We pass the `raining` and `noise` parameters into the object's keys as their value.

    ```js
    this.raining = raining;
    this.noise = noise;
    ```

    * 🔑 The third key is a function called `makeNoise()`. The function checks if the `raining` key's value is `true`. If it is, it will log the value of the key's `noise` in the console.

    ```js
    this.makeNoise = function() {
      if (this.raining === true) {
        console.log(this.noise);
      }
    };
    ```

    * When we run `node catsDogs.js` in the console, the `dog` and `cat` objects are created and the `makeNoise()` method is called on them.

    ```js
    let dog = new Animal(true, "Woof!");
    let cat = new Animal(false, "Meow!");

    dog.makeNoise();
    cat.makeNoise();
    ```

    * Only the `dog`'s "Woof!" will be logged in the console since its `raining` value is set to `true`.

    * However, for the bonus, we can set the `raining` value of `cat` to `true` and call the `makeNoise()` method to make it "Meow!" in the console.

    ```js
    cat.raining = true;
    cat.makeNoise();
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How are constructors useful?

    * 🙋 They allow us to create as many objects as we want, all from a single blueprint. This lessens redundant code.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understanding this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 1 and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 6. Instructor Demo: Mini-Bank (5 min) 

* Navigate to `02-Mini-Bank/Solved/` in your command line and run `node minibank.js` to demonstrate the following: 

    * 🔑 We can see that our starting balance is 0.

    * 🔑 Then we deposited 85, so the balance is 85.

    * 🔑 Then we withdrew 20, so the balance is 65.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used constructors and the `this` keyword in our RPG.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 Although we won't directly use constructor functions in the upcoming challenge, we will use ES6 Classes, which uses the `this` keyword. 

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 The basic `MiniBank` constructor is given. We will need to add functions and log the transactions in the console.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 7. Student Do: Mini-Bank (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Mini-Bank/README.md`.

    ```md
    # MiniBank

    In this activity, you will use objects to create a mini banking application.

    ## Instructions

    ### Part 1 - Add methods and properties to `MiniBank`

    Open [Unsolved/minibank.js](Unsolved/minibank.js) and update the `MiniBank` constructor function with the following methods and properties:

    * Add a `setBalance()` function. 

        * This function should receive a `value` parameter and assign it to the `balance` property of `MiniBank`.

    * Add a `deposit()` function. 

        * This function should receive a `value` parameter and call `setBalance()` to update the `balance` property after adding the `value` amount.

        * Log the amount that was deposited in the console, i.e. `Deposited 85!`

    * Write a `withdraw()` function. 

        * This function should receive a `value` parameter and call `setBalance()` to update the `balance` property after subtracting the `value` amount.

        * Log the amount that was withdrawn in the console, i.e. `Withdrew 20!`

    ### Part 2 - Create and use a `MiniBank` instance

    * Create a new `bank` object using the `MiniBank` constructor function.

    * Print the `bank` balance.

    * Deposit some money into the `bank` object.

    * Print the `bank` balance.

    * Withdraw some money from the `bank` object.

    * Print the `bank` balance.

    ## Hint(s)

    * Before you can call the `setBalance()` function, you will need to call the `getBalance()` function to add or subtract the `value` amount and get a new balance. 

    ## Bonus

    * Add code to throw an error if the user tries to withdraw more money than they have, or try to deposit or withdraw values that aren't positive numbers.
    ```


### 8. Instructor Review: Mini-Bank (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ `setBalance()`

    * ✔️ `deposit()`

    * ✔️ `withdraw()`

    * ✔️ Create and use a `MiniBank` instance

* Open `02-Mini-Bank/Solved/minibank.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 We create a `setBalance()` function that will receive a `value` parameter and assign it to the `balance` property.

    ```js
    this.setBalance = function(value) {
        this.balance = value;
    },
    ```

    * 🔑 We create a `deposit()` function that will receive a `value` parameter and add it to the current balance using `getBalance()`. 
    
    * Then it will call `setBalance()` to update the `balance` property with this new balance.

    * Finally we log the `value` that was deposited in the console.

    ```js
    this.deposit = function(value) {
        let newBalance = this.getBalance() + value;
        this.setBalance(newBalance);
        console.log(`Deposited ${value}!`);
    },
    ```

    * 🔑 We create a `withdraw()` function that will receive a `value` parameter and subtract it from the current balance using `getBalance()`. 
    
    * Then it will call `setBalance()` to update the `balance` property with this new balance.

    * Finally we log the `value` that was withdrawn in the console.

    ```js
    this.withdraw = function(value) {
        let newBalance = this.getBalance() - value;
        this.setBalance(newBalance);
        console.log(`Withdrew ${value}!`);
    },
    ```

    * 🔑 We create a new `bank` object using the `MiniBank` constructor function and then we print the `bank` balance.

    ```js
    let bank = new MiniBank(0);
    bank.printBalance();
    ```
    
    * We deposit some money and then print the `bank` balance.

    ```js
    bank.deposit(85);
    bank.printBalance();
    ```

    * We withdraw some money and then print the `bank` balance.

    ```js
    bank.withdraw(20);
    bank.printBalance();
    ```

    * If you got to the bonus, here is how we would throw an error if the user tries to deposit or withdraw values that aren't positive numbers, or tries to withdraw more money than the current balance. 

    ```js
    // If values are not positive numbers
    if (typeof value !== "number" || value <= 0) {
      throw new Error("'value' must be a positive number!");
    }

    // If withdrawal amount is more than balance
    if (newBalance < 0) {
      throw new Error("Insufficient funds for this transaction");
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How does OOP make solving this activity easier?

    * 🙋 The use of objects and constructors allows us to create a single blueprint, that we can then use to create as many instances of our `MiniBank` as we like.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understanding this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 1 and 2, read the [MDN docs on Object-oriented JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object-oriented_JS), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 09. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

    * 🙋 We covered constructor functions and the use of the `this` keyword. 

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful. 

    * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

    * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer. 

    * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

    * 🙋 Constructors and `this` are introduced in Lesson 1 and used throughout this module.

    * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Use student answers to transition to office hours.


### 10. Office Hours (30 min)

* Announce office hours and invite students to stay on the Zoom and start the challenge while they have live support from instructional staff.
