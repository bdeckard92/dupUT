# 10.1 Virtual Class: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Overview

In today's virtual class, students will review test-driven development (TDD).

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Implement test-driven development methods to build unit tests for specific functionality.

* Write code to make unit tests pass.

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to review the activities before class. Try to anticipate any questions students might have.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly, ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity, and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* If students struggle with the activities or become frustrated, support them by letting them know that these topics can be difficult to understand. They are learning a new way to approach and develop code, which will get easier with time and practice. These skills will also make them employer-competitive! If you are comfortable doing so, share your own experiences and struggles learning and working with OOP and TDD.

* Emphasize the relevance and importance of the activities. TDD is useful because it reinforces the practice of breaking a coding challenge into manageable chunks, as well as coding with a plan. Ultimately, it helps students build leaner, more predictable code.

* If the students struggle with the "Everyone Do: Git" activity, walk through it using the talking points provided. Otherwise, support the students as they work on the activity and do a brief review at the end.

* To refresh your memory of some of the specific methods often used by testing frameworks, consider creating a few failing tests before class, and then write the code to make them pass. You might also benefit from installing the [Jest Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=andys8.jest-snippets) plugin for VS Code.

* If you need to review TDD using Jest, refer to the [Jest documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started).

* TDD is taught in Lesson 1 of the async content.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Invite students to post questions in the Zoom chat so TAs and/or the instructor can address them at the end of class.

* Open the lesson's [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1O_Or8Fv6twbV4V9mIllFGczAqcdMzb5Mw2nzv94Cgfw/edit?usp=sharing) and review the following slides on foundation setting:

    **The Big Picture**: This is an opportunity to look at the big picture of where students are in the course. Take a moment to discuss a few real-world examples of why this week's topics are valuable.

    **Boot Camp Pointers**: Review some logistics that will help students stay on track. This is an opportunity to speak to what students might need at this particular point in the course.

    **This Week: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Review the key skills students will be learning this week.

    **This Week's Assignment**: Give a quick summary of this week's Challenge assignment and describe how the skills they learn throughout the week will be applied to it.

    **Career Connection**: Reinforce that students will use the skills they learn this week throughout their careers. Help them understand the "why" and "how" behind the "what" they're learning. Give examples of how these skills are used on the job. If you feel comfortable, share examples of how you have used them in your professional career.

    * Explain that object-oriented programming is a crucial concept not only for JavaScript but for coding in general. The principles that students learn this week will be directly transferable to any language they might work with after boot camp.

  * Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è Can anybody name some server-side programming languages other than Node.js?

    * üôã C#, Java, Python, C++ (and you might get some more abstract answers).

    * ‚òùÔ∏è Many of these are object-oriented programming languages, meaning that we can write entire programs using the concepts that we will work through this week. While the syntax differs a little bit, objects in Java or C# work very similarly to how they work in JavaScript. But why do we care? Why is this important?

    * üôã Because it means that we can apply to more than just JavaScript roles! We could also apply for jobs that require C# or Java and emphasize our object-oriented programming experience on the application and during the interview.

  **How to Succeed This Week**: Remind students that they might experience moments of frustration as they learn complex concepts and tools, and that these times are actually proven opportunities to deepen knowledge. Consider sharing something about your personal learning journey. This helps students recognize that everyone starts somewhere and that they are not alone in their struggles.

  **Today's Agenda**: Outline the concepts that will be covered in today's lesson: following TDD practices, students will write unit tests for specific functionality and then write code to make those tests pass. Remind students that they can find the relevant activity files in the "Getting Ready for Class" page in their course content.

### 2. Instructor Do: Student Check-In (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How do you feel about your progress so far?

  * üôã Remind students that they are adding another layer to their full-stack skill set. It's important to consider what they have accomplished and to acknowledge that it is a lot! Let them know that it‚Äôs okay to feel overwhelmed -- as long as they don‚Äôt give up.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with this topic?

  * üôã Let's do Fist to Five together. If you don't feel confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 3. Instructor Demo: TDD (5 min)

* In the command line, navigate to `01-TDD/Solved` and run `npm install` and `npm run test` to demonstrate the following:

  * üîë When we use the test-driven development approach, we write unit tests that describe the expected functionality of the code **before we write the actual code**. This helps us define exactly what needs to happen in the app so that we can write only the code to meet those needs.

  * üîë We start by stating the expectation, or the task that the code needs to perform in order for the test to pass. For example, in the first test, we expect that the algorithm `isPalindrome1` should return `false` if the string is not a palindrome (remind students that a palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, such as "madam").

    ```sh
      ‚óè Algo ‚Ä∫ isPalindrome ‚Ä∫ should return false if a string is not a palindrome
    ```

  * üîë We then write the unit test. We use the `expect()` method to check that the value returned by the algorithm meets a certain condition. We then set that condition using the matcher `toEqual()`, which checks whether the expected value matches (i.e., is equal to) the expected value. In this case, the test will pass if the value returned by the `isPalindrome` algorithm is `false` when the string is not a palindrome.

    ```sh
    expect(received).toEqual(expected)
    ```

  * üîë Because the code is not written yet, no value is returned from the `isPalindrome` algorithm, so the value is `undefined`.

    ```sh
    Expected: false
    Received: undefined
    ```

  * Note that the tests are still failing.

    ```sh
    Test Suites: 1 failed, 1 total
    Tests:       4 failed, 4 total
    Snapshots:   0 total
    ```

  * That is okay! In TDD, we start with failing tests and then write the necessary code to make them pass. So for this first step, we only need to write the tests, and we expect them to fail. We will write the code to make the tests pass later.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Where have we used this before?

  * üôã We used Jest unit tests in Lesson 1.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

  * üôã In the Challenge, we will use TDD to write unit tests for each part of the code and ensure that each test passes.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?

  * üôã We start by defining an expectation and then write a test using Jest methods that test that expectation. Then, after writing the test, we write and refactor the code so that it passes the test.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: TDD (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-TDD/README.md`, which are also shown here:

  ```md
  # üìñ Write Tests for Algorithms

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to create tests to define the expectations for algorithms.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It is done when the `reverse()` test is written to expect the string `"Hello World!"` to become `"!dlroW olleH"` after calling `new Algo().reverse()`.

  * It is done when the `isPalindrome()` test is written to expect the string `"racecar"` to return `true` and the string `"neon"` to return `false` after calling `new Algo().isPalindrome()`.

  * It is done when the `capitalize()` test is written to expect the string `"capitalize the first letter of each word in a string."` to become `"Capitalize The First Letter Of Each Word In A String."` after calling `new Algo().capitalize()`.

  ## üìù Notes

  For this activity, no code has been added to the `algo.js` test. As a result, all of the tests will fail. This is the expected behavior. Later, we will build on these skills to write tests that define the expectations of actual code.

  Refer to the documentation:

  [Jest API documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/api)

  ---

  ## üí° Hints

  How can we use the `describe()`, `it()`, and `expect()` functions in Jest to check for the expected behavior?

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * Where can you find examples of well-written tests?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 5. Instructor Review: TDD (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points (‚úîÔ∏è):

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `describe()`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `it()`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `expect()`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `toEqual()`

* In your IDE, open `01-TDD/Solved/test/algo.test.js` and explain the following:

  * First, we run `require()` for the file that contains the functions we want to test.

    ```js
    const Algo = require("../algo");
    ```

  * üîë The tests are wrapped in a parent `describe()` function for `Algo`.

    ```js
    describe("Algo", () => {
      ...
    }
    ```

  * üîë Now we can build tests for specific functionality, starting with `reverse()`. The `it()` method allows us to use plain language to describe what the function should do.

  * Next, we define `str` as the starting string, `reversed` as `str` backwards, and `result` as the actual result of the `reverse()` function.

  * üîë Finally, we pass `result` as an argument into `expect()` and compare it to the value of `reversed` using the `toEqual()` method -- meaning that we expect the value of `result` to equal the value of `reversed`.

    ```js
    describe("reverse", () => {
      it("should reverse a given string", () => {
        const str = "Hello World!";
        const reversed = "!dlroW olleH";

        const result = new Algo().reverse(str);

        expect(result).toEqual(reversed);
      });
    });
    ```

  * In each case, we are checking what the method returns given a certain input. We set up the same testing for `isPalindrome()` and `capitalize()`.

  * üîë The `describe()` statement for `isPalindrome()` contains two tests because we need to use `it()` twice -- once to test that `isPalindrome()` returns `true` when a string is a palindrome and once to return `false` when it is not.

    ```js
    describe("isPalindrome", () => {
      it("should return true if a string is a palindrome", () => {
        const str = "racecar";

        const result = new Algo().isPalindrome(str);

        expect(result).toEqual(true);
      });

      it("should return false if a string is not a palindrome", () => {
        const str = "neon";

        const result = new Algo().isPalindrome(str);

        expect(result).toEqual(false);
      });
    ```

  * We follow the same format for the test for `capitalize()`. Notice again how Jest allows us to write readable, intuitive tests.

    ```js
    describe("capitalize", () => {
      it("should take a string and return a new string with the first letter of each word capitalized", () => {
        const str = "capitalize every first word of the string.";
        const capitalized = "Capitalize Every First Word Of The String.";

        const result = new Algo().capitalize(str);

        expect(result).toEqual(capitalized);
      });
    });
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è When should we use the `describe()` method?

  * üôã When we have several related tests that we want to group together.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What is the TDD cycle?

  * üôã First, we write tests that describe how the code should work. Then we write code, run tests, debug the code, and repeat this part of the process until the tests pass.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to Lesson 1, read the [Jest API documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/api), and attend Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Pass Tests (5 min)

* In the command line, navigate to `02-Pass-Tests/Solved` and run `npm install` and `npm run test` to demonstrate the following:

  * üîë After setting up the tests for the code, we write the code so that the tests pass.

      ```sh
       PASS  test/algo.test.js
        Algo
        reverse
            ‚úì should reverse a given string (3 ms)
        isPalindrome
            ‚úì should return true if a string is a palindrome
            ‚úì should return false if a string is not a palindrome
        capitalize
            ‚úì should take a string and return a new string with the first letter of each word capitalized (1 ms)

        Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
        Tests:       4 passed, 4 total
      ```

* In your IDE, open `02-Pass-Tests/Solved/algo.js` and explain the following:

  * üîë When we write the code, we start by thinking about the steps needed to make the tests pass. We can write these steps as comments in the code as a reminder of the code we will need to write, which will help ensure that we follow the plan.

    ```js
    Algo.prototype.reverse = function(str) {
      // return `str` with chained functions
      // convert string to an array
      // reverse substrings in array
      // convert array back into a string
    };
    ```

  * üîë Once we have listed the necessary steps, we write the code for each step to pass the test.

    ```js
    Algo.prototype.reverse = function(str) {
     // return `str` with chained functions
     return str
     // convert string to an array
     .split("")
     // reverse substrings in array
     .reverse()
     // convert array back into a string
     .join("");
    };
    ```

  * üîë To check whether the code solution passes the test, we run `npm run test`. If the test fails, we refactor it and try again. This process of testing and refactoring is an essential step in test-driven development and is an important skill to practice to write leaner, more durable code.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Where have we used this before?

  * üôã We practiced writing code based on unit tests in Lesson 1.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

  * üôã After we write unit tests in Jest, we will need to make sure the code passes each of the tests.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?

  * üôã Once the unit tests are written, we use JavaScript to write the algorithm code. To test whether the code passes, we run `npm run test`. If the test does not pass, we refactor until it does.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Pass Tests (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Pass-Tests/README.md`, which are also shown here:

  ```md
  # üèóÔ∏è Implement Code to Pass Tests

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to write code that will meet expectations and pass my tests.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It is done when I have written code for a reverse algorithm that takes in a string such as `"Hello World!"` and returns a reversed string such as `"!dlroW olleH"`.

  * It is done when I have written code for a palindrome algorithm that uses the `reverse()` method and checks whether the string is a [palindrome](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/palindrome).

  * It is done when I have written code for a capitalize algorithm that converts the first letter in each word of a string to an uppercase letter.

  * It is done when I can run `npm run test` in the command line and verify that I have correctly implemented each method, and each test passes.

  ---

  ## üí° Hints

  What clues can we glean from `tests/algo.test.js` about how to write the function?

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What are ATDD and BDD methods? How are they similar to or different from TDD?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 8. Instructor Review: Pass Tests (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points (‚úîÔ∏è):

  * ‚úîÔ∏è TDD cycle

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `algo.test.js`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `npm run test`

* In your IDE, open `02-Pass-Tests/Solved/test/algo.test.js` and explain the following:

  * üîë We will follow the TDD cycle and review the tests to determine what we need to build.

  * üîë The first test in `algo.test.js` should look familiar. We need to build a function called `reverse()` that takes in a string as an argument, reverses it, and returns the reversed string.

    ```js
    describe("reverse", () => {
      it("should reverse a given string", () => {
        const str = "Hello World!";
        const reversed = "!dlroW olleH";
        const result = new Algo().reverse(str);
        expect(result).toEqual(reversed);
      });
    });
    ```

* In your IDE, open `02-Pass-Tests/Solved/algo.js` and explain the following:

  * Inside the `reverse()` function, we write code that returns `str` with a chain of functions attached. First, we convert `str` into an array of substrings using `split("")`. Then we call `reverse()` to reverse the order of the array. Finally, we call `join("")` to convert the array back into a string.

    ```js
    Algo.prototype.reverse = function(str) {
      return str
        .split("")
        .reverse()
        .join("");
    };
    ```

* In the console, run `npm run test` and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë Success! When we run `npm run test`, `reverse()` passes the test.

    ```bash
    Algo
      reverse
        ‚úì should reverse a given string (2ms)
    ```

* In your IDE, open `02-Pass-Tests/Solved/test/algo.test.js` and explain the following:

  * üîë  Let's repeat the TDD cycle with the second test. `isPalindrome()` includes two tests that we need to pass. The first verifies that it `"should return true if a string is a palindrome"` and the second verifies that it `"should return false if a string is not a palindrome"`.

    ```js
    describe("isPalindrome", () => {
      it("should return true if a string is a palindrome", () => {
        const str = "racecar";
        const result = new Algo().isPalindrome(str);
        expect(result).toEqual(true);
      });

      it("should return false if a string is not a palindrome", () => {
        const str = "neon";
        const result = new Algo().isPalindrome(str);
        expect(result).toEqual(false);
      });
    });
    ```

* In your IDE, open `02-Pass-Tests/Solved/algo.js` and explain the following:

  * Inside the `isPalindrome()` function, we use `reverse()` as a helper function to check whether `str` is the same when it is reversed.

    ```js
    Algo.prototype.isPalindrome = function(str) {
      return this.reverse(str) === str;
    };
    ```

* In the console, run `npm run test` and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë When we run `npm run test`, `isPalindrome()` passes both tests.

    ```
    isPalindrome
      ‚úì should return true if a string is a palindrome
      ‚úì should return false if a string is not a palindrome
    ```

* In your IDE, open `02-Pass-Tests/Solved/test/algo.test.js` and explain the following:

  * üîë Let's repeat the TDD cycle one last time, with the third and final test. `capitalize()` includes one test, which verifies that it `"should take a string and return a new string with the first letter of each word capitalized"`.

    ```js
    describe("capitalize", () => {
      it("should take a string and return a new string with the first letter of each word capitalized", () => {
        const str = "capitalize every first word of the string.";
        const capitalized = "Capitalize Every First Word Of The String.";
        const result = new Algo().capitalize(str);
      expect(result).toEqual(capitalized);
      });
    });
    ```

* In your IDE, open `02-Pass-Tests/Solved/algo.js` and explain the following:

  * Inside the `capitalize()` function, we convert the string to an array using `split()`, then we map over the array and capitalize the first letter of each word. Finally, we convert the array back into a string using `join()`.

    ```js
    Algo.prototype.capitalize = function(str) {
      return str.split(" ").map(word => {
      return word.substring(0, 1).toUpperCase() + word.substring(1);
      }).join(" ");
    };
    ```

* In the console, run `npm run test` and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë When we run `npm run test`, all of the tests now pass, including `capitalize()`.

    ```
    PASS  test/algo.test.js
      Algo
        reverse
          ‚úì should reverse a given string (2ms) isPalindrome
          ‚úì should return true if a string is a palindrome
          ‚úì should return false if a string is not a palindrome capitalize
          ‚úì should take a string and return a new string with the first letter of each word capitalized (1ms)

    Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
    Tests:       4 passed, 4 total
    Snapshots:   0 total
    Time:        1.362s
    Ran all test suites.
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What is the benefit of writing tests before we write any code?

  * üôã This approach helps us ensure that the code will work. It also helps us write code more quickly because we do not have to manually test the code.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to Lessons 1 and 2, read the [Jest documentation on getting started](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started), and attend Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Everyone Do: Git Stash (30 min)

* Open the [Git documentation on stashing](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-stash) in your browser and explain the following:

  * `git stash` saves your uncommitted changes in a non-destructive manner, then reverts those changes from your working copy.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `Git-Guide/README.md`.

* While everyone is working on the activity, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

* To demonstrate `git stash`, edit some of the files in the class repository, if you haven't already.

* Open your command line and demonstrate the following:

  * Running `git status` shows that there are untracked changes.

  * Running `git stash` sets aside those changes in the stack.

  * Running `git stash pop` reapplies those changes.

* Answer any questions before proceeding.

### 10. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):
