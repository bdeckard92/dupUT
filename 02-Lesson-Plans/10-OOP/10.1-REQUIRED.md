# Module 10 Virtual Class: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Overview 

In today's virtual class, students will review Test Driven Development and solve a new algorithm in CodeSignal. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Implement Test Driven Design methods to build unit tests for specific functionality

* Write code to make unit tests pass

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* If you notice that your students are struggling with the activities or feeling frustrated, encourage them by letting them know that these are hard topics to understand. With time and practice, it will get easier and will make them employer-competitive! If you are comfortable doing so, share your own struggle and/or personal experiences learning and working with OOP.

## Class Instructions 

### 1. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Invite students to post questions in the Zoom chat so TAs and/or the instructor can address them at the end of class.

* Open the lesson's [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1O_Or8Fv6twbV4V9mIllFGczAqcdMzb5Mw2nzv94Cgfw/edit?usp=sharing) and walk through the following slides on foundation setting: 

    **Big Picture**: This is an opportunity to look at the big picture of where students are in the course. Take a moment to discuss a few real-world examples of why this week's topics are valuable.

    **Boot Camp Pointers**: Review some logistics that will help students stay on track. This is an opportunity to speak to what students might need at this particular point in the course. 

    **This Week**: Review the key skills students will be learning this week. 

    **This Week's Assignment**: Give a quick summary of this week's Challenge assignment and describe how the skills they learn throughout the week will be applied to it.

    **Career Connection**: Reinforce that students will use the skills they learn this week throughout their careers. It's important for them to know the "why" and "how" behind the "what." Give examples of how these skills are used on the job. If you feel comfortable, share examples of how you have used them in your professional career.

    * Let students know that object-oriented programming is a crucial concept not only for JavaScript but for coding in general. Whatever language they end up working with after boot camp, these principles they learn this week are directly transferable. 

    * Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

        * ☝️ Can anybody name some server-side programming languages other than Node.js?

        * 🙋 C#, Java, Python, C++ (and you may get some more abstract answers).

        * ☝️ Many of these are object-oriented programming languages, meaning that we write entire programs using the concepts that we will work through this week in JavaScript. The cool part is that while there is a little syntax difference, objects in Java or C# work very similarly to how they work in JavaScript. But why do we care? Why is this important?

        * 🙋 Because it means we aren't limited to applying to only JavaScript roles! We could also apply for jobs using C# or Java and lean into our object-oriented programming experience for the application and interview.

    **How to Succeed This Week**: Remind students that they might experience moments of frustration as they learn complex concepts and tools, and that these times are actually proven opportunities to deepen knowledge. Consider sharing something about your personal learning journey. This helps students recognize that everyone starts somewhere and that they are not alone.

    **Today's Objectives:** Outline the concepts that will be covered in today's lesson. Remind students that they can find the relevant activity files in the "Getting Ready for Class" page in their course content.

### 2. Instructor Do: Student Check-In (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

  * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back at what we accomplished and acknowledge that it is a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed&mdash;as long as you don’t give up.

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic?

  * 🙋 Let's do Fist to Five together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 3. Instructor Demo: TDD (5 min) 

* Navigate to `01-TDD/Solved/` in your command line and run 'npm install' and 'npm run test' to demonstrate the following: 

    * 🔑 When we use the Test-Driven Development approach, we write unit tests that describe the expected functionality of the program before writing any code. 

    * 🔑 We start by stating the expectation. For example, in our first test we expect that the algorithm `isPalindrome1 should return false if the string is not a palindrome.

      ```sh
       ● Algo › isPalindrome › should return false if a string is not a palindrome
      ```

    * 🔑 We then write the actual test. We use the `expect()` method to check that the value returned by the algorithm meets a certain condition. We then set that condition using the matcher `toEqual()` which checks to see if the expected value matches -- or is equal to -- the expected value. In this case, the test will pass if the value returned by the `isPalindrome` algorithm is `false` if the string is not a palindrome. 

      ```sh
      expect(received).toEqual(expected)
      ```

    * 🔑 Since the code is not written yet, no value is returned from the `isPalindrome` algorithm, so the value is `undefined. 

      ```sh
      Expected: false
      Received: undefined
      ```

    * We see that the tests -- and all the tests -- are still failing. That is okay. In TDD, we start with failing tests and then write the code needed to make them pass. For this first step, though, we are only focused on the tests. We will write the code to make the tests pass in the next step. 

      ```sh
      Test Suites: 1 failed, 1 total
      Tests:       4 failed, 4 total
      Snapshots:   0 total
      ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used a constructor function to create potions for the role-playing game in Lesson 1.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

    * 🙋 In the Challenge, we will use Test-Driven Development to write unit tests for each part of our code and ensure each test passes.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 When we use Test-Driven Development, we start by defining an expectation and then write a test using Jest methods that test that expectation. Then, after writing the test, we write and refactor the code so it passes the test. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: TDD (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-TDD/README.md`, which are also shown here:

    ```md
     # 📖 Write Tests for Algorithms

    Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

    * As a developer, I want to create tests to define the expectations for algorithms.

    ## Acceptance Criteria

    * It's done when the `reverse()` test is written to expect the string `"Hello World!"` to become `"!dlroW olleH"` after calling `new Algo().reverse()`.

    * It's done when the `isPalindrome()` test is written to expect the string `"racecar"` to return `true` and the string `"neon"` to return `false` after calling `new Algo().isPalindrome()`.

    * It's done when the `capitalize()` test is written to expect the string `"capitalize the first letter of each word in a string."` to become `"Capitalize The First Letter Of Each Word In A String." after calling `new Algo().capitalize()`.


    ## 📝 Notes

    For this activity, no code has been added to the `algo.js` test. As a result, all the tests will fail. This is the expected behavior. In the next activities, we will build on these skills to write tests that define the expectations of actual code. 

    Refer to the documentation: 

    [Jest API documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/api)

    ---

    ## 💡 Hints

    How can we use the `describe()`, `it()`, and `expect()` functions in Jest to check for expected behavior?

    ## 🏆 Bonus

    If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

    * Where can you find examples of well-written tests? 

    Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
    ```

### 5. Instructor Review: TDD (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points (:key:) below to review the following key points (✔️):

    * ✔️ `describe()`

    * ✔️ `it()`

    * ✔️ `expect()`

    * ✔️ `toEqual()`

* Open `01-TDD/Solved/test/algo.test.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * First we run `require()` for the file that contains the functions we want to test, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    const Algo = require("../algo");
    ```

  * 🔑 The tests are wrapped in a parent `describe()` function for `Algo`, as follows:

    ```js
    describe("Algo", () => {
      ...
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 Now we can build tests for specific functionality, starting with `reverse()`. The `it()` method allows us to describe what the function should do in plain language.

  * Next, we define `str` as the starting string, `reversed` as `str` backwards, and `result` as the actual result of the `reverse()` function.

  * 🔑 Finally, we pass `result` as an argument into `expect()` and compare it to the value of `reversed` using the `toEqual()` method&mdash;meaning that we expect the value of `result` to equal the value of `reversed`! See the following code for an example:

    ```js
    describe("reverse", () => {
      it("should reverse a given string", () => {
        const str = "Hello World!";
        const reversed = "!dlroW olleH";

        const result = new Algo().reverse(str);

        expect(result).toEqual(reversed);
      });
    });
    ```

  * In each case, we're checking what the method returns given a certain input. We set up the same testing for `isPalindrome()` and `capitalize()`.
  
  * 🔑 The `describe()` statement for `isPalindrome()` contains two tests because we needed to use `it()` twice&mdash;once to test that `isPalindrome()` returns true when a string is a palindrome and once to return false when it isn't, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    describe("isPalindrome", () => {
      it("should return true if a string is a palindrome", () => {
        const str = "racecar";

        const result = new Algo().isPalindrome(str);

        expect(result).toEqual(true);
      });

      it("should return false if a string is not a palindrome", () => {
        const str = "neon";

        const result = new Algo().isPalindrome(str);

        expect(result).toEqual(false);
      });
    ```

  * We follow the same format for the test for `capitalize()`. Notice again how Jest allows us to write readable, intuitive tests, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    describe("capitalize", () => {
      it("should take a string and return a new string with the first letter of each word capitalized", () => {
        const str = "capitalize every first word of the string.";
        const capitalized = "Capitalize Every First Word Of The String.";

        const result = new Algo().capitalize(str);

        expect(result).toEqual(capitalized);
      });
    });
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ When should we use the `describe()` method?

    * 🙋 When we have several related tests that we want to group together.

    * ☝️ What is the TDD cycle?

    * 🙋 First we write tests that describe how the code should work. Then we write code, run tests, debug the code, and repeat this part of the process until the tests pass.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 1 and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Pass Tests (5 min) 

* Navigate to `02-Pass-Tests/Solved/` in your command line and run 'npm install' and 'npm run test' to demonstrate the following: 

    * 🔑 We can see that our starting balance is 0.

    * 🔑 Then we deposited 85, so the balance is 85.

    * 🔑 Then we withdrew 20, so the balance is 65.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used constructors and the `this` keyword in our role-playing game.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

    * 🙋 Although we won't directly use constructor functions in the upcoming Challenge, we will use ES6 Classes, which uses the `this` keyword. 

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 The basic `MiniBank` constructor is given. We will need to add functions and log the transactions in the console.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: MiniBank (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Mini-Bank/README.md`, which are also shown here:

     ```md
     # MiniBank

     In this activity, you will use objects to create a mini banking application.

     ## Instructions

     ### Part 1: Add methods and properties to `MiniBank`

     Open [Unsolved/minibank.js](Unsolved/minibank.js) and update the `MiniBank` constructor function with the following methods and properties:

     * Add a `setBalance()` function. 

         * This function should receive a `value` parameter and assign it to the `balance` property of `MiniBank`.

     * Add a `deposit()` function. 

         * This function should receive a `value` parameter and call `setBalance()` to update the `balance` property after adding the `value` amount.

         * Log the amount that was deposited in the console, i.e. `Deposited 85!`

     * Write a `withdraw()` function. 

         * This function should receive a `value` parameter and call `setBalance()` to update the `balance` property after subtracting the `value` amount.

         * Log the amount that was withdrawn in the console, i.e. `Withdrew 20!`

     ### Part 2: Create and use a `MiniBank` instance

     * Create a new `bank` object using the `MiniBank` constructor function.

     * Print the `bank` balance.

     * Deposit some money into the `bank` object.

     * Print the `bank` balance.

     * Withdraw some money from the `bank` object.

     * Print the `bank` balance.

     ## Hint(s)

     * Before you can call the `setBalance()` function, you will need to call the `getBalance()` function to add or subtract the `value` amount and get a new balance. 

     ## Bonus

     * Add code to throw an error if the user tries to withdraw more money than they have, or try to deposit or withdraw values that aren't positive numbers.
     ```

### 8. Instructor Review: MiniBank (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points (:key:) below to review the following key points (✔️):

    * ✔️ `setBalance()`

    * ✔️ `deposit()`

    * ✔️ `withdraw()`

    * ✔️ Create and use a `MiniBank` instance

* Open `02-Mini-Bank/Solved/minibank.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 We create a `setBalance()` function that will receive a `value` parameter and assign it to the `balance` property.

         ```js
         this.setBalance = function(value) {
             this.balance = value;
         },
         ```

    * 🔑 We create a `deposit()` function that will receive a `value` parameter and add it to the current balance using `getBalance()`. 
    
    * Then it will call `setBalance()` to update the `balance` property with this new balance.

    * Finally, we log the `value` that was deposited in the console.

         ```js
         this.deposit = function(value) {
             let newBalance = this.getBalance() + value;
             this.setBalance(newBalance);
             console.log(`Deposited ${value}!`);
         },
         ```

    * 🔑 We create a `withdraw()` function that will receive a `value` parameter and subtract it from the current balance using `getBalance()`. 
    
    * Then it will call `setBalance()` to update the `balance` property with this new balance.

    * Finally we log the `value` that was withdrawn in the console.

         ```js
         this.withdraw = function(value) {
             let newBalance = this.getBalance() - value;
             this.setBalance(newBalance);
             console.log(`Withdrew ${value}!`);
         },
         ```

    * 🔑 We create a new `bank` object using the `MiniBank` constructor function and then we print the `bank` balance.

         ```js
         let bank = new MiniBank(0);
         bank.printBalance();
         ```
    
    * We deposit some money and then print the `bank` balance.

         ```js
         bank.deposit(85);
         bank.printBalance();
         ```

    * We withdraw some money and then print the `bank` balance.

         ```js
         bank.withdraw(20);
         bank.printBalance();
         ```

    * If you got to the bonus, here is how we would throw an error if the user tries to deposit or withdraw values that aren't positive numbers, or tries to withdraw more money than the current balance. 

         ```js
         // If values are not positive numbers
         if (typeof value !== "number" || value <= 0) {
           throw new Error("'value' must be a positive number!");
         }

         // If withdrawal amount is more than balance
         if (newBalance < 0) {
           throw new Error("Insufficient funds for this transaction");
         }
         ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How does OOP make solving this activity easier?

    * 🙋 The use of objects and constructors allows us to create a single blueprint, that we can then use to create as many instances of our `MiniBank` as we like.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 1 and 2, read the [MDN docs on Object-oriented JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object-oriented_JS), and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

    * 🙋 We covered constructor functions and the use of the `this` keyword. 

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful. 

    * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

    * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the Challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer. 

    * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

    * 🙋 Constructors and `this` are introduced in Lesson 1 and used throughout that module.

    * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Use student answers to transition to Office Hours.

### 10. Challenge Review (30 min)

* Take this time to help get students unblocked on the current Challenge that they are working through.

* Expect that students may ask for the following:

  * Further review on a particular subject

  * Debugging assistance

  * Help with computer issues

  * Guidance with a particular tool

### 11. End
