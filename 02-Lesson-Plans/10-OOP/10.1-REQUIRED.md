# Module 10 Virtual Class: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Overview 

In today's virtual class, students will review Test Driven Development and solve a new algorithm in CodeSignal. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Implement Test Driven Development methods to build unit tests for specific functionality

* Write code to make unit tests pass

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* If you notice that your students are struggling with the activities or feeling frustrated, encourage them by letting them know that these are hard topics to understand. With time and practice, it will get easier and will make them employer-competitive! If you are comfortable doing so, share your own struggle and/or personal experiences learning and working with OOP and Test Driven Development.

* Help students to see the bigger picture with the activities. While they may be struggling, Test Driven Development is a useful programming practice that reinforces the skills of breaking down a coding challenge into manageable chunks and coding with a plan and will ultimately help them build leaner, more predictable code. 

* If you need a quick brushup on Test-Driven Development with Jest prior to class, [Jest documentation(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) provides a great review of methods used in testing. 

* Test Driven Development is taught in Lesson 1.

## Class Instructions 

### 1. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Invite students to post questions in the Zoom chat so TAs and/or the instructor can address them at the end of class.

* Open the lesson's [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1O_Or8Fv6twbV4V9mIllFGczAqcdMzb5Mw2nzv94Cgfw/edit?usp=sharing) and walk through the following slides on foundation setting: 

    **Big Picture**: This is an opportunity to look at the big picture of where students are in the course. Take a moment to discuss a few real-world examples of why this week's topics are valuable.

    **Boot Camp Pointers**: Review some logistics that will help students stay on track. This is an opportunity to speak to what students might need at this particular point in the course. 

    **This Week**: Review the key skills students will be learning this week. 

    **This Week's Assignment**: Give a quick summary of this week's Challenge assignment and describe how the skills they learn throughout the week will be applied to it.

    **Career Connection**: Reinforce that students will use the skills they learn this week throughout their careers. It's important for them to know the "why" and "how" behind the "what." Give examples of how these skills are used on the job. If you feel comfortable, share examples of how you have used them in your professional career.

    * Let students know that object-oriented programming is a crucial concept not only for JavaScript but for coding in general. Whatever language they end up working with after boot camp, these principles they learn this week are directly transferable. 

    * Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

        * ☝️ Can anybody name some server-side programming languages other than Node.js?

        * 🙋 C#, Java, Python, C++ (and you may get some more abstract answers).

        * ☝️ Many of these are object-oriented programming languages, meaning that we write entire programs using the concepts that we will work through this week in JavaScript. The cool part is that while there is a little syntax difference, objects in Java or C# work very similarly to how they work in JavaScript. But why do we care? Why is this important?

        * 🙋 Because it means we aren't limited to applying to only JavaScript roles! We could also apply for jobs using C# or Java and lean into our object-oriented programming experience for the application and interview.

    **How to Succeed This Week**: Remind students that they might experience moments of frustration as they learn complex concepts and tools, and that these times are actually proven opportunities to deepen knowledge. Consider sharing something about your personal learning journey. This helps students recognize that everyone starts somewhere and that they are not alone.

    **Today's Objectives:** Outline the concepts that will be covered in today's lesson. Remind students that they can find the relevant activity files in the "Getting Ready for Class" page in their course content.

### 2. Instructor Do: Student Check-In (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

  * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back at what we accomplished and acknowledge that it is a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed&mdash;as long as you don’t give up.

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic?

  * 🙋 Let's do Fist to Five together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 3. Instructor Demo: TDD (5 min) 

* Navigate to `01-TDD/Solved` in your command line and run `npm install` and `npm run test` to demonstrate the following: 

    * 🔑 When we use the Test Driven Development approach, we write unit tests that describe the expected functionality of the code before writing the actual code. This helps use define exactly what we need to happen with our app and then write only the code we need to meet our expectations. 

    * 🔑 We start by stating the expectation, or the task we need the code to perform in order for the test to pass.  For example, in our first test we expect that the algorithm `isPalindrome1` should return false if the string is not a palindrome.

      ```sh
       ● Algo › isPalindrome › should return false if a string is not a palindrome
      ```

    * 🔑 We then write the unit test. We use the `expect()` method to check that the value returned by the algorithm meets a certain condition. We then set that condition using the matcher `toEqual()` which checks to see if the expected value matches -- or is equal to -- the expected value. In this case, the test will pass if the value returned by the `isPalindrome` algorithm is `false` if the string is not a palindrome. 

      ```sh
      expect(received).toEqual(expected)
      ```

    * 🔑 Since the code is not written yet, no value is returned from the `isPalindrome` algorithm, so the value is `undefined`. 

      ```sh
      Expected: false
      Received: undefined
      ```

    * We see that the tests are still failing. That is okay. In TDD, we start with failing tests and then write the code needed to make them pass. For this first step, though, we are only focused on writing the tests so we expect the tests to fail. We will write the code to make the tests pass in the next activity. 

      ```sh
      Test Suites: 1 failed, 1 total
      Tests:       4 failed, 4 total
      Snapshots:   0 total
      ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used Jest unit tests in Lesson 1.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

    * 🙋 In the Challenge, we will use Test Driven Development to write unit tests for each part of our code and ensure each test passes.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 When we use Test Driven Development, we start by defining an expectation and then write a test using Jest methods that test that expectation. Then, after writing the test, we write and refactor the code so it passes the test. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: TDD (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-TDD/README.md`, which are also shown here:

    ```md
     # 📖 Write Tests for Algorithms

    Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

    * As a developer, I want to create tests to define the expectations for algorithms.

    ## Acceptance Criteria

    * It's done when the `reverse()` test is written to expect the string `"Hello World!"` to become `"!dlroW olleH"` after calling `new Algo().reverse()`.

    * It's done when the `isPalindrome()` test is written to expect the string `"racecar"` to return `true` and the string `"neon"` to return `false` after calling `new Algo().isPalindrome()`.

    * It's done when the `capitalize()` test is written to expect the string `"capitalize the first letter of each word in a string."` to become `"Capitalize The First Letter Of Each Word In A String." after calling `new Algo().capitalize()`.


    ## 📝 Notes

    For this activity, no code has been added to the `algo.js` test. As a result, all the tests will fail. This is the expected behavior. In the next activities, we will build on these skills to write tests that define the expectations of actual code. 

    Refer to the documentation: 

    [Jest API documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/api)

    ---

    ## 💡 Hints

    How can we use the `describe()`, `it()`, and `expect()` functions in Jest to check for expected behavior?

    ## 🏆 Bonus

    If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

    * Where can you find examples of well-written tests? 

    Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
    ```

### 5. Instructor Review: TDD (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points (:key:) below to review the following key points (✔️):

    * ✔️ `describe()`

    * ✔️ `it()`

    * ✔️ `expect()`

    * ✔️ `toEqual()`

* Open `01-TDD/Solved/test/algo.test.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * First we run `require()` for the file that contains the functions we want to test, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    const Algo = require("../algo");
    ```

  * 🔑 The tests are wrapped in a parent `describe()` function for `Algo`, as follows:

    ```js
    describe("Algo", () => {
      ...
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 Now we can build tests for specific functionality, starting with `reverse()`. The `it()` method allows us to describe what the function should do in plain language.

  * Next, we define `str` as the starting string, `reversed` as `str` backwards, and `result` as the actual result of the `reverse()` function.

  * 🔑 Finally, we pass `result` as an argument into `expect()` and compare it to the value of `reversed` using the `toEqual()` method&mdash;meaning that we expect the value of `result` to equal the value of `reversed`! See the following code for an example:

    ```js
    describe("reverse", () => {
      it("should reverse a given string", () => {
        const str = "Hello World!";
        const reversed = "!dlroW olleH";

        const result = new Algo().reverse(str);

        expect(result).toEqual(reversed);
      });
    });
    ```

  * In each case, we're checking what the method returns given a certain input. We set up the same testing for `isPalindrome()` and `capitalize()`.
  
  * 🔑 The `describe()` statement for `isPalindrome()` contains two tests because we needed to use `it()` twice&mdash;once to test that `isPalindrome()` returns true when a string is a palindrome and once to return false when it isn't, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    describe("isPalindrome", () => {
      it("should return true if a string is a palindrome", () => {
        const str = "racecar";

        const result = new Algo().isPalindrome(str);

        expect(result).toEqual(true);
      });

      it("should return false if a string is not a palindrome", () => {
        const str = "neon";

        const result = new Algo().isPalindrome(str);

        expect(result).toEqual(false);
      });
    ```

  * We follow the same format for the test for `capitalize()`. Notice again how Jest allows us to write readable, intuitive tests, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    describe("capitalize", () => {
      it("should take a string and return a new string with the first letter of each word capitalized", () => {
        const str = "capitalize every first word of the string.";
        const capitalized = "Capitalize Every First Word Of The String.";

        const result = new Algo().capitalize(str);

        expect(result).toEqual(capitalized);
      });
    });
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ When should we use the `describe()` method?

    * 🙋 When we have several related tests that we want to group together.

    * ☝️ What is the TDD cycle?

    * 🙋 First we write tests that describe how the code should work. Then we write code, run tests, debug the code, and repeat this part of the process until the tests pass.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 1, read [Jest API documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/api)  and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Pass Tests (5 min) 

* Navigate to `02-Pass-Tests/Solved` in your command line and run `npm install` and `npm run test` to demonstrate the following: 

    * 🔑 After setting up the tests for our code, we write the code so our tests pass. 
    
      ```sh
       PASS  test/algo.test.js
        Algo
        reverse
            ✓ should reverse a given string (3 ms)
        isPalindrome
            ✓ should return true if a string is a palindrome
            ✓ should return false if a string is not a palindrome
        capitalize
            ✓ should take a string and return a new string with the first letter of each word capitalized (1 ms)

        Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
        Tests:       4 passed, 4 total
      ```

 *  Open `02-Pass-Tests/Solved/algo.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 When we write our code, we start by thinking about the steps needed to make our tests pass. It is a good idea to write these steps as comments in our code to remind us of what code we will need to write. This also helps us stick to our plan.

      ```js
      Algo.prototype.reverse = function(str) {
        // return `str` with chained functions
        // convert string to an array
        // reverse substrings in array
        // convert array back into a string
      };
      ```

    * 🔑 Once we have the steps needed to write our code to pass our test, we write the code to meet each step.

      ```js
      Algo.prototype.reverse = function(str) {
       // return `str` with chained functions
       return str
       // convert string to an array
       .split("")
       // reverse substrings in array
       .reverse()
       // convert array back into a string
       .join("");
      };
      ```

    * 🔑 To check if our code solution passes the test, we run `npm run test`. If the test fails, we refactor and try again. This process of testing and refactoring is an essential step in Test Driven Development and is an important skill for developers to practice to help them write more durable and leaner code. 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We practiced writing code based on unit tests in Lesson 1.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

    * 🙋 For the Challenge, we will be writing unit tests in Jest and then making sure our code passes each tests. 

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 Once the unit tests are written, we use JavaScript to write our algorithm code. To test to see if our code passes, we run the `npm run test`. If the test does not pass, we refactor until our code passes. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Pass Tests (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Pass-Tests/README.md`, which are also shown here:

     ```md
     # 🏗️ Implement Code to Pass Tests

    Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

    * As a developer, I want to write code that will meet expectations and pass my tests.

    ## Acceptance Criteria

    * It's done when I have written code for a reverse algorithm that takes in a string such as "Hello World!" and returns a reversed string such as "!dlroW olleH".

    * It's done when I have written code for a palindrome algorithm that uses the reverse method and checks if the string is a [palindrome](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/palindrome). 

    * It's done when I have written code for a capitalize algorithm that converts the first letter in each word of a string to an upper case letter.

    * It's done when I can run `npm run test` in the command line and verify that I correctly implemented each method and each test passes.

    ---

    ## 💡 Hints

    What clues can we glean from `tests/algo.test.js` about how to write the function?

    ## 🏆 Bonus

    If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

    * What are ATDD and BDD methods? How are they similar to or different from TDD?

    Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
     
     ```

### 8. Instructor Review: Pass Tests (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ TDD cycle

  * ✔️ `algo.test.js`

  * ✔️ `npm run test`

* Open `02-Pass-Tests/Solved/test/algo.test.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 We will follow the TDD cycle and review the tests to determine what we need to build. 
  
  * 🔑 The first test in `algo.test.js` should look familiar. We need to build a function called `reverse()` that takes in a string as an argument, reverses it, and returns the reversed string, as follows:

    ```js
    describe("reverse", () => {
      it("should reverse a given string", () => {
        const str = "Hello World!";
        const reversed = "!dlroW olleH";
        const result = new Algo().reverse(str);
        expect(result).toEqual(reversed);
      });
    });
    ```

* Open `02-Pass-Tests/Solved/algo.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * Inside the `reverse()` function, we write code that returns `str` with a chain of functions attached. First we convert `str` into an array of substrings using `split("")`. Then we call `reverse()` to reverse the order of the array. Finally, we call `join("")` to convert the array back into a string&mdash;as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    Algo.prototype.reverse = function(str) {
      return str
        .split("")
        .reverse()
        .join("");
    };
    ```

* Run `npm run test` in the console and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 Success! When we run `npm run test`, `reverse()` passes the test, as shown in the following example:

    ```bash
    Algo
      reverse
        ✓ should reverse a given string (2ms)
    ```
    
* Open `02-Pass-Tests/Solved/test/algo.test.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑  Let's repeat the TDD cycle with the second test. `isPalindrome()` includes two tests that we need to pass. The first verifies that it `"should return true if a string is a palindrome"` and the second verifies that it `"should return false if a string is not a palindrome"`. See the following code for an example:

    ```js
    describe("isPalindrome", () => {
      it("should return true if a string is a palindrome", () => {
        const str = "racecar";
        const result = new Algo().isPalindrome(str);
        expect(result).toEqual(true);
      });

      it("should return false if a string is not a palindrome", () => {
        const str = "neon";
        const result = new Algo().isPalindrome(str);
        expect(result).toEqual(false);
      });
    });
    ```

* Open `02-Pass-Tests/Solved/algo.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * Inside the `isPalindrome()` function, we use `reverse()` as a helper function to check whether `str` is the same when it is reversed&mdash;otherwise known as a palindrome&mdash;as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    Algo.prototype.isPalindrome = function(str) {
      return this.reverse(str) === str;
    };
    ```

* Run `npm run test` in the console and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 When we run `npm run test`, `isPalindrome()` passes both tests, as follows:

    ```
    isPalindrome
      ✓ should return true if a string is a palindrome
      ✓ should return false if a string is not a palindrome
    ```
    
* Open `02-Pass-Tests/Solved/test/algo.test.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 Let's repeat the TDD cycle one last time, with the third and final test. `capitalize()` includes one test that we need to pass, verifying that it `"should take a string and return a new string with the first letter of each word capitalized"`, as follows:

    ```js
    describe("capitalize", () => {
      it("should take a string and return a new string with the first letter of each word capitalized", () => {
        const str = "capitalize every first word of the string.";
        const capitalized = "Capitalize Every First Word Of The String.";
        const result = new Algo().capitalize(str);
      expect(result).toEqual(capitalized);
      });
    });
    ```

* Open `02-Pass-Tests/Solved/algo.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * Inside the `capitalize()` function, we convert the string to an array using `split()`, then we map over the array and capitalize the first letter of each word. Finally, we convert the array back into a string using `join()`, as follows:

    ```js
    Algo.prototype.capitalize = function(str) {
      return str.split(" ").map(word => {
      return word.substring(0, 1).toUpperCase() + word.substring(1);
      }).join(" ");
    };
    ```

* Run `npm run test` in the console and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 All of the tests now pass when we run `npm run test`, including `capitalize()`, as shown in the following example:

    ```
    PASS  test/algo.test.js
      Algo
        reverse
          ✓ should reverse a given string (2ms) isPalindrome
          ✓ should return true if a string is a palindrome
          ✓ should return false if a string is not a palindrome capitalize
          ✓ should take a string and return a new string with the first letter of each word capitalized (1ms)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What is the benefit of writing tests before we write any code?

    * 🙋 This approach helps us ensure that the code will work. It also helps us code more quickly because we do not have to manually test the code.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 1 and 2, read the [Jest API documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started), and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

    * 🙋 We covered Test Driven Development, or TDD, and how to write tests and code that will pass those tests. 

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful. 

    * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

    * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the Challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer. 

    * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

    * 🙋 Test Driven Development is introduced in Lesson 1 and used throughout that module.

    * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?
