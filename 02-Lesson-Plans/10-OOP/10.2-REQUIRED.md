## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What did you learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

    * 🙋 We learned about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). We used constructors, classes, prototypes, and Jest for TDD. We are moving fast compared to traditional learners. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ Did anyone have an "Aha!" or "Eureka!" moment this week? When was it and why did things suddenly click for you? 

    * 🙋 Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we're thinking about it.

    * ☝️ Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

    * 🙋 It's easy to get stuck when you're learning web development. It's important to learn how to get unstuck because it happens to the pros too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the tool's official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups are great because explaining your problems to someone else often reveals the solution. 


### 2. Review Current Challenge (5 min)

@TODO USE THE FOLLOWING FOR BROWSER AND/OR COMMAND LINE DEMOS, RESPECTIVELY. REMOVE IF UNUSED
* Open `@TODO/folder/file` in your browser and demonstrate the following:
* Run `@TODO/folder/file { AND ARGS, IF ANY }` from the command line and demonstrate the following: 

    * @TODO { WHEN WE DO THIS, IT DOES THAT. }

    * @TODO { WE ALSO SEE THESE THINGS. }

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What recently acquired skills will help us build this challenge?

    * 🙋 @TODO { YES, WHAT? }

    * ☝️ How are these skills relevant to a career in web development?

    * 🙋 @TODO { YES, WHAT? }

    * ☝️ How will this challenge improve your portfolio?

    * 🙋 @TODO { YES, HOW? }

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 3. Instructor Demo: Prototypes (5 min) 

* Navigate to `03-RPG-Prototypes/Solved/` in your command line and run `node rpg-prototypes.js` and demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 We see two characters with their stats (`name`, `strength`, and `hitpoints`) printed in the console.

    * 🔑 We see one character attack the other character.

    * 🔑 We see the stats of the character that got attacked.

    * 🔑 We see that the character that got attacked is still alive!

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used prototypes in Lesson 2 when we rewrote methods like `getStats()` and `getInventory()` from the `Player()` function into prototype methods.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 @TODO { YES, HOW? } 

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We will need to create a constructor function and prototype methods.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 4. Student Do: Prototypes  (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `03-RPG-Prototypes/README.md`.

    ```md
    # RPG Prototypes

    In this activity, you will generate RPG characters using constructors and prototypes.

    ## Instructions

    * Open the [Unsolved/rpg-prototypes.js](Unsolved/rpg-prototypes.js) file.

    * Create a constructor function called `Character` that takes in 3 arguments and assigns them to the appropriate keys:

    * `name`

    * `strength`

    * `hitpoints`

    * Create 3 prototype methods:

    * `printStats()`: Function which prints all of the stats for a character

    * `isAlive()`: Function which prints whether or not this character is alive by determining whether their hitpoints are above or below zero.

    * `attack()`: Function which takes in a second character and subtracts this character's strength from their hitpoints.
    ```

### 5. Instructor Review: Prototypes  (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ Constructor function `Character`

    * ✔️ `printStats()`

    * ✔️ `isAlive()`

    * ✔️ `attack()`

* Open `03-RPG-Prototypes/Solved/rpg-prototypes.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 We create a constructor function called `Character` that takes in `name`, `strength`, and `hitpoints`. We assign those arguments to keys in our constructor.

    ```js
    function Character(name, strength, hitpoints) {
      this.name = name;
      this.strength = strength;
      this.hitpoints = hitpoints;
    }
    ```

    * 🔑 We create a prototype method called `printStats()` which will print all three of those stats in the console.

    ```js
    Character.prototype.printStats = function() {
      console.log(
        'Name: ' + this.name +
        '\nStrength: ' + this.strength +
        '\nHitPoints: ' + this.hitpoints
      );
      console.log('\n-------------\n');
    };
    ```

    * 🔑 We create a prototype method called `isAlive()` which will print whether or not this character is alive by determining whether their `hitpoints` are above or below zero.

    ```js
    Character.prototype.isAlive = function() {
      if (this.hitpoints > 0) {
        console.log(this.name + ' is still alive!');
        console.log('\n-------------\n');
      } else {
        console.log(this.name + ' has died!');
        }
      };
    };
    ```

    * 🔑 We create a prototype method called `attack()` which will take in a second character and subtract its strength from their own hitpoints.

    ```js
    Character.prototype.attack = function(opponent) {
      opponent.hitpoints -= this.strength;
      console.log(this.name + ' attacked ' + opponent.name + '!!');
      console.log('\n-------------\n');
    };
    ```

    * If coded correctly, when you run `rpg-prototypes.js` you will see two characters' stats, one character attacking the other, and the attacked character's stats and whether they are alive or dead.

    ```js
    warrior.printStats();
    rogue.printStats();

    rogue.attack(warrior);
    warrior.printStats();
    warrior.isAlive();
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Why don't we just declare the methods in the constructor?

    * 🙋 When we bind a function using the `this` keyword, the method only exists on that instance of the object. For any method bound to `this`, it will be re declared with each new instance of an object.

    * ☝️ How does the prototype help us solve this problem?

    * 🙋 The prototype allows us to declare methods that will be attached to all instances of an object of that prototype. Because the method is applied to the prototype, it is only stored in memory once for all instances.

    * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 2, read the [MDN Docs on Object Prototypes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object_prototypes), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 6. Instructor Demo: Classes  (5 min) 

* Navigate to `04-RPG-Classes/Solved/` in your command line and run `node rpg-classes.js` and demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 We see a similar output as the previous activity. However, instead of constructor functions, this one uses ES6 Classes.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used ES6 Classes in Lesson 5 when we converted the constructor functions, like `Potion()` and `Player()`, to ES6 Classes.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 @TODO { YES, HOW? } 

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We will simply take our code from the previous activity and rewrite them into ES6 Class syntax. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.
