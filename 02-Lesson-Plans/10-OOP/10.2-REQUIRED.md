# Module 10 Virtual Class: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Overview 

In today's virtual class, students will review mocking with Jest and ES6 Classes.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Test functionality with Jest's `spyOn()` method

* Implement classes to create new instances of objects

* Implement multiple classes with different purposes to practice the OOP paradigm


## Instructor Notes 

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try and anticipate questions students may have.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* If you see your students struggle with the activities or get frustrated, encourage them and let them know these are hard topics to understand and that they are learning a new way to approach and develop code. With time and practice, it will get easier and will make them employer-competitive! If you are comfortable doing so, share your own struggle and/or personal experiences learning and working with OOP.

* Help students to see the bigger picture with the activities. While they may be struggling, learning ES6 Classes is useful for those with an interest in mobile development and this exposure prepares them to transition to other languages such as Java, C++, and Swift. Likewise, Test Driven Development is a useful programming practice that reinforces the skills of breaking down a coding challenge into manageable chunks and coding with a plan. 

* If you need a quick brushup on ES6 Classes prior to class, [MDN Web Documentation on classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) provides a great review of the basic components of classes. 

* If you need a quick brushup on Jest's `spyOn()` method prior to class, [Jest API documentation on spyOn()](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/jest-object#jestspyonobject-methodname) provides a description of the method and its usage. 

* Mocks are taught in Lesson 2 and ES6 Classes are taught in Lesson 5. 

## Office Hours

Encourage students to work on the remaining module algorithms during office hours. Review the algorithm solutions 5–10 minutes before class begins or during office hours after class.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What did you learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

  * 🙋 We learned about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). We used constructors, classes, prototypes, and Jest for TDD. We are moving fast compared to traditional learners. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

  * ☝️ Did anyone have an "Aha!" or "Eureka!" moment this week? When was it and why did things suddenly click for you? 

  * 🙋 Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we're thinking about it.

  * ☝️ Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

  * 🙋 It's easy to get stuck when you're learning web development. It's important to learn how to get unstuck because it happens to the pros too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the tool's official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups are great because explaining your problems to someone else often reveals the solution. 


### 2. Review Current Challenge (5 min)

* Navigate to `02-Challenge/Main` in your command line and run `node app.js` to demonstrate the following: 

    * This challenge is to build a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

    * The application prompts the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. 
    
    * When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What recently acquired skills will help us build this challenge?

    * 🙋 Jest for unit testing, ES6 Classes and `inquirer` for collecting input from the user will all be used to build this challenge.

    * ☝️ How are these skills relevant to a career in web development?

    * 🙋 Since many employers will require programming in TDD, knowing how to write good unit tests will be crucial to your career. 

    * ☝️ How will this challenge improve your portfolio?

    * 🙋 It will demonstrate a firm understanding of Node.js fundamentals as well as ES6 and unit testing.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 3. Instructor Demo: First Mock (5 min) 

* Navigate to `03-First-Mock/Solved` in your command line and run `node index.js` to demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 When we run `node index.js`, we see a printout of the names and ages of each children currently at day care. We also notice the list changes after an event occurs, like `Picked up Amir from day care`. 

      ```js
      [
        Child { name: 'Amir', age: 3 },
        Child { name: 'Zhang Wei', age: 1 },
        Child { name: 'Kyle', age: 2 }
      ]

      At capacity, unable to add more children
      [
        Child { name: 'Amir', age: 3 },
        Child { name: 'Zhang Wei', age: 1 },
        Child { name: 'Kyle', age: 2 }
      ]

      Picked up Amir from day care
      [ Child { name: 'Zhang Wei', age: 1 }, Child { name: 'Kyle', age: 2 } ]

      [
        Child { name: 'Zhang Wei', age: 1 },
        Child { name: 'Kyle', age: 2 },
        Child { name: 'Rosie', age: 1 }
      ]

      Picked up Zhang Wei from day care
      Unable to add child, they are over the age limit
      [ Child { name: 'Kyle', age: 2 }, Child { name: 'Rosie', age: 1 } ]
      ```

    * These console logs are essential to the functioning of our app. Using Jest, we can spy on the functionality of these console logs to make sure they are actually working as expected. 

* Navigate to `03-First-Mock/Solved/test/dayCare.test.js` in your IDE to demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 We add Jest's `spyOn()` method to our test to mock and track the `console.log` method to see if it is functioning as we expect.

      ```js
      const mock = jest.spyOn(console, "log");
      ```

    * 🔑 We then use the `mock.mockImplementation()` method to temporarily wrap the functionality of `console.log()` with an empty function that does nothing, as follows:

      ```js
      mock.mockImplementation(() => { });
      ```

    * 🔑 Next, we use the `expect()` method to set the expectation that the `console.log` to be called and to return a message in the log. Because we are mocking the `console.log()` method, nothing will actually be printed to the console when the test is run.

      ```js
       expect(mock).toBeCalledWith(
        "Unable to add child, they are over the age limit"
      );
      ```

    * 🔑 Finally, after we run our test to spy on our `console.log`, we want to restore our original functionality. To do so, we use the `mockRestore` method. 

      ```js
       mock.mockRestore();
      ``` 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used mocks in Lesson 2. Mocking is part of Test Driven Development and another way we can use to gain insight on our code's behavior to help us write more durable code. 

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 When we use the `spyOn` method, we have a way to track existing functions and the behavior of our code. Although not required, this is a useful feature that we can use to test the functionality of our Challenge code. Learning mocking also helps us think about the behavior and outcomes of our code. This will help us write better, more predictable code as developers.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We use Jest's `spyOn` method to track functionality, like a `console.log` in our code. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 4. Student Do: First Mock (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `03-First-Mock/README.md`.

  ```md
   # 🐛 Running npm run test Results in Errors

  Work with a partner to resolve the following issues:

  * As a developer, I want the tests for `dayCare.test.js` to pass when I run `npm install` and `npm run test` in the console.

  ## Expected Behavior

  * When we run `npm run test` in the console, we should not receive an error.

  * When we run `npm run test` in the console, the tests for `dayCare.test.js` should be passing.

  ## Actual Behavior

  * When we run `npm run test` in the console, we receive the following error: `"Cannot spyOn on a primitive value; undefined given"`.

  * When we run `npm run test` in the console, the tests for `dayCare.test.js` are not passing.

  ## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

  1. Navigate to the `Unsolved` folder in this activity.

  2. Run `npm install` in your console.

  3. Run `npm run test` in your console.

  ## Assets

  The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

  ![The console indicates that the test suites and tests have passed, with no messages or errors displayed.](./images/image.png)

  ---

  ## 💡 Hints

  What does the error tell you about what is missing, and how do we capture the value of `console.log`?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What are two or three other methods that can be used in conjunction with `spyOn`?

  Use the [Jest API documentation on spyOn()](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/jest-object#jestspyonobject-methodname) to research this.

  ```

### 5. Instructor Review: First Mock (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `jest.spyOn()`

  * ✔️ `mock.mockImplementation()`

* Open `03-First-Mock/Solved/test/dayCare.test.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 Using `jest.spyOn()`, we pass in the arguments `console` and `"log"` to spy on the `console.log()` method. 

    ```js
    const mock = jest.spyOn(console, "log");
    ```
  
  * 🔑 We pass in an empty function to `mock.mockImplementation()` to replace the functionality of the `console.log()` method.

    ```js
    mock.mockImplementation(() => { });
    ```

  * Now we can use `expect(mock).toBeCalledWith()` to verify that it was called with the arguments that we expect, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    const mock = jest.spyOn(console, "log");
    mock.mockImplementation(() => {});

    dayCare.addChild(child);

    expect(dayCare.children.length).toEqual(0);
    expect(mock).toBeCalledWith(
      "Unable to add child, they are over the age limit"
    );
    ```

  * We will clean up any mocks we run at the end of a test to ensure that the next test is not affected. We can "unmock" `console.log()` by using the `mock.mockRestore()` method, as shown in the following example: 

    ```js
    mock.mockRestore();
    ```
* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What can we use Jest's `spyOn()` method for? 

    * 🙋 We can use Jest's `spyOn()` method to spy on the behavior of a function instead of just testing the output.

    * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 2, read the [Jest API documentation on spyOn()](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/jest-object#jestspyonobject-methodname), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 6. Instructor Demo: Classes  (5 min) 

* Navigate to `04-Classes/Solved` in your command line and run `node character.js` to demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 When we run the `character.js` file in the console, a game is displayed. This game uses ES6 Classes.

    * 🔑 These ES6 Classes are blueprints for creating objects.

* Navigate to `04-Classes/Solved/character.js` in your IDE to demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 We use the `class` keyword to declare a class. 

      ```js
      class Character {...}
      ```

    * 🔑 We then use a constructor to create and initialize an object. This constructor describes the `name`, `strength`, and `hitPoints` of our object.

      ```js
      constructor(name, strength, hitPoints) {
        this.name = name;
        this.strength = strength;
        this.hitPoints = hitPoints;
      }
      ``` 

    * 🔑 We then use methods to describe the functionality associated with the object. For example, we can add a method that checks if our object is alive based on the number of `hitPoints` it has remaining. 

      ```js
      isAlive() {
        if (this.hitPoints <= 0) {
          console.log(`${this.name} has been defeated!`);
          return false;
        }
        return true;
      }
      ```

    * 🔑 When we create an ES6 Class, we are actually creating a template that describes the characteristics and functionality for a group of objects. To actually create an object, we use the `new` operator and assign values. The new object will inherit all the characteristics of its class. Our new object `grace`, for example, will have a `name`, `strength` and `hitPoints`. 

    * 🔑 To provide a value for the `name`, `strength` and `hitPoints`, we add the values as parameters. These values will be unique to `grace`.

      ```js
      const grace = new Character('Grace', 30, 75);
      ```

    * Since our new object `grace` has inherited all the characteristics of the `Character` class,  the `grace` object has access the methods. To check if our new character `grace`  is out of hitPoints and no longer alive, we call the `.isAlive()` method on `grace`. In this case we are actually checking if the `grace` character is not alive, so the not `!` operator has been added. 

      ```js
      !grace.isAlive()
      ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used ES6 Classes in Lesson 5 when we converted the constructor functions, like `Potion()` and `Player()`, to ES6 Classes.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 The challenge utilizes ES6 Classes for the `Employee`, `Manager`, `Engineer`, and `Intern`.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We will declare a class using the `class` keyword and use the constructor method to initiate our object. We can also add methods to add functionality to our class object. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 7. Student Do: Classes  (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Classes/README.md`.

```md
# 🏗️ Write and Implement Classes

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a user, I want a command-line RPG that allows two characters to battle each other.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when a new `Character` can be created with the following properties:

  * `name` is a string that contains the character's name.

  * `strength` is a number that indicates how much damage the character's attacks will inflict.

  * `hitPoints` is a number that indicates how many hit points the character has.

* It's done when each `Character` has the following methods:

  * `printStats()` logs the character's name, strength, and hit points, as follows:

    ```js
    console.log(`Stats for ${this.name} are:\n`)
    console.log(`Each attack will do ${this.strength} damage`)
    console.log(`${this.name} has ${this.hitPoints} hit points remaining`)
    ```

  * `isAlive()` returns a Boolean based on whether or not a character's hit points are less than or equal to zero.

  * `attack()` accepts an opposing `Character` object and subtracts the current character's `strength` from the opponent's `hitPoints`.

* It's done when I can run `node character.js` and see two instances of `Character` battle each other until one of them is defeated.

---

## 💡 Hints

How can we start small? Can we benefit from first trying to make one character attack another until the game is over?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How can we add validation to ensure that each character is provided the proper three arguments when created?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
```

### 8. Instructor Review: Classes  (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `constructor()`

  * ✔️ `this`

  * ✔️ Method syntax

* Open `22-Stu_Classes/Solved/character.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 The `Character` class includes a `constructor()` method that accepts three arguments, as follows:

    ```js
    class Character {
      constructor(name, strength, hitPoints) {
        this.name = name;
        this.strength = strength;
        this.hitPoints = hitPoints;
      }
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 The `printStats()` method uses `this` to reference the current character's properties, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    printStats() {
      console.log(`Stats for ${this.name} are as following:`);
      console.log(`Each attack will do ${this.strength} damage.`);
      console.log(`${this.name} has ${this.hitPoints} hit points remaining!`);
      console.log("------------");
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 The `isAlive()` method returns `false` if `this.hitPoints` is less than zero, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    isAlive() {
      if (this.hitPoints <= 0) {
        console.log(`${this.name} has been defeated!`)
        return false;
      }
      return true;
    };
    ```

  * The `attack()` method updates the object being passed in as the argument, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    attack(opponent) {
      console.log(`${this.name} hit ${opponent.name} for ${this.strength}`)
      opponent.hitPoints -= this.strength;
    };
    ```

  * We use the `new` keyword to create two new `Character` instances, as follows:

    ```js
    const grace = new Character("Grace", 30, 75);
    const dijkstra = new Character("Dijkstra", 20, 105);
    ```

  * We use `setInterval()` to run a game loop, using the `graceTurn` variable to swap who should attack first each time, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    let graceTurn = true;

    const turnInterval = setInterval(() => {
      if(!grace.isAlive() || !dijkstra.isAlive()) {
        clearInterval(turnInterval);
        console.log("Game over!");
      } else if(graceTurn) {
        grace.attack(dijkstra);
        dijkstra.printStats();
      } else {
        dijkstra.attack(grace);
        grace.printStats();
      }
      
      graceTurn = !graceTurn;
    }, 2000);
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What are some differences between constructor functions and classes?

    * 🙋 ES6 classes must be called with the `new` keyword. With ES5 constructors, you could call `Character()` on its own. The other difference is that ES6 classes are not hoisted. 

    * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understanding this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 5, read the [MDN docs on Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Instructor Demo: Multiple Classes  (5 min) 

* In Javascript, when we write an ES6 Class, the class should provide the blueprint for a single object. To use a real-world example, if we have both a table and a chair, we would need two blueprints to build them. When using Classes, you will often have more than one class in your code. 

* Navigate to `05-Multiple-Classes/Solved/` in your command line and run `node index.js` to demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 In this command line app, whe have built an interface for a store called Big Al's Toy Barn. Taking a look at the output, it looks like we may need to have more than one class to create blueprints for the objects.

* Navigate to `05-Multiple-Classes/Solved/toy.js` in your IDE to demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 Let's start small. Big Al's toy store is going to need to have toys. In addition, each toy needs to have a name, a price, and a count.

      ```js
      class Toy {
        constructor(name, price, count) {
        this.name = name;
        this.price = price;
        this.count = count;
      }
      ```

    * 🔑 Now that we have a blueprint, we can make some toy objects. We use the `new` operator to create two toy objects in an array and export everything so we can use it in other parts of our code. 

      ```js
      const toys = [
        new Toy("Action Figure", 14.99, 5),
        new Toy("Rare Toy", 17.99, 1)
      ];

      module.exports = {
        Toy,
        toys
      };
      ```

    * Notice that we are keeping all the code needed for the toys in a separate file. This modular method will help keep our code clean and make it much easier to write unit tests for our code. This is an important step, especially as our code gets bigger.

* Navigate to `05-Multiple-Classes/Solved/store.js` in your IDE to demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 Now to sell our toys, we need a blueprint for Big Al's store. We declare a store class, initialize it with a constructor, and give it some methods that will be used to perform some store-related tasks. 

      ```js
      class Store {
          constructor(name, stock) {
            this.name = name;
            this.stock = stock;
            this.revenue = 0;
        }
        processProductSale(name) {
          this.stock.forEach(item => {
            if (item.name === name) {
              if (item.count > 0) {
                item.count--;
                this.revenue += item.price;
                 console.log(`Purchased ${item.name} for ${item.price}`);
                } else {
                  console.log(`Sorry, ${item.name} is out of stock!`);
                }
              }
            });
          }
        replenishStock(name, count) {
          this.stock.forEach(item => {
            if (item.name === name) {
              item.count += count;
                console.log(`Replenished ${item.name} by ${item.count}`);
              }
            });
          }
        printRevenue() {
          console.log(`The revenue so far is ${this.revenue}`);
        }
        welcome() {
          console.log(`Welcome to ${this.name}!`);
        }
      }
      ```

    * 🔑 We then export our Store class, so we can use it elsewhere in our code. 

       ```js
       module.exports = Store;
       ```

* Navigate to `05-Multiple-Classes/Solved/index.js` in your IDE to demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 Now that we have both our toy objects and our Store class, we can put it all together. We create a new instance of the store, give it the name `Big Al's Toy Barn`, and set the stock value to be our array of toys. 

      ```js
      const store = new Store("Big Al's Toy Barn", toys);
      ```

    * Now the store's stock will be populated by our toy objects so our store can perform the needed inventory operations. 


* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We practiced ES6 Classes in Lesson 5.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 For the challenge, we will be required to create multiple classes and organize our code to maintain separation of concerns. The code is easier to navigate if we give each class a clear responsibility.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 When we plan an app, we first think about each object that we will need to use and how they may interact. Then, we declare each class with the class keyword and initialize each class with a constructor function. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

    ```

### 11. Instructor Review: Multiple Classes (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ `class` keyword

    * ✔️ `processProductSale()`

    * ✔️ `replenishStock()`

    * ✔️ `const store = new Store("Big Al's Toy Barn", toys);`

* Open `05-Multiple-Classes/Solved/store.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * Now, that we have spent time reverse engineering the code, let's take a closer look. 

  * We can create a new store by passing in the `name` and `stock` properties. For each new instance of the `Store` class, the constructor will set `revenue` to `0`. When we initialize a new instance of the store, we will give the store a name and set the value of `stock` to be equal to our toy objects. 

    ```js
    class Store {
      constructor(name, stock) {
      this.name = name;
      this.stock = stock;
      this.revenue = 0;
    }
    ```
  
  * 🔑 We also write methods to describe actions we wan to perform. In the `processProductSale()` method, we loop through each stock item in the store. Once we've found one with a name that matches the item we want to process, we decrease its count by one and increase the store's revenue by the price of the item. See the following code for an example:

    ```js
    processProductSale(name) {
      this.stock.forEach(item => {
        if (item.name === name) {
          if (item.count > 0) {
            item.count--;
            this.revenue += item.price;
            console.log(`Purchased ${item.name} for ${item.price}`);
          } else {
            console.log(`Sorry, ${item.name} is out of stock!`);
          }
        }
      });
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 In `replenishStock()` we find the matching item by name and increase its count by the specified number, as follows:

    ```js
    replenishStock(name, count) {
      this.stock.forEach(item => {
        if (item.name === name) {
          item.count += count;
          console.log(`Replenished ${item.name} by ${item.count}`);
        }
      });
    }
    ```

* Open `05-Multiple-Classes/Solved/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We put it all together in the `index.js` file. First, we make sure our Store class and our toys are imported

    ```js
    const Store = require('./store');
    const { toys } = require('./toy');
    ```
  
  * 🔑 Then we use the `new` operator to create a new store instance with the name of the store. We also set the value of `stock` to equal our toy objects.

    ```js
    const store = new Store("Big Al's Toy Barn", toys);
    ```

  * Now that the our new store has access to our toy objects, we simply call the store's methods to handle the store's inventory.

    ```js
    store.replenishStock('Rare Toy', 2); 
    store.processProductSale('Rare Toy');
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understanding this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 5, read the [MDN Web Docs on classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.
