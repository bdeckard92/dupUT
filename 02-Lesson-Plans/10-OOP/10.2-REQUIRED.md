# 10.2 Virtual Class: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Overview

In today's virtual class, students will review mocking with Jest and ES6 classes.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Test functionality using Jest's `spyOn()` method.

* Implement classes to create new instances of objects.

* Implement multiple classes with different purposes in order to practice the OOP paradigm.

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and review the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students might have.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly, ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity, and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* If students struggle with the activities or become frustrated, support them by letting them know that these topics can be difficult to understand. They are learning a new way to approach and develop code, which will get easier with time and practice. These skills will also make them employer-competitive! If you are comfortable doing so, share your own struggle and/or personal experiences learning and working with OOP.

* Help students to see the bigger picture with the activities. While they might be struggling, learning ES6 classes is useful for those with an interest in mobile development and this exposure prepares them to transition to other languages such as Java, C++, and Swift. Likewise, test-driven development is a useful programming practice that reinforces the skills of breaking down a coding challenge into manageable chunks and coding with a plan.

* If you need a quick refresher on ES6 classes before class, the [MDN Web Docs on classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) contains a review of the basic components of classes.

* If you need a quick refresher on Jest's `spyOn()` method before class, the [Jest API documentation on spyOn()](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/jest-object#jestspyonobject-methodname) provides a description of the method and its usage.

* In the next module, students will write and test Express.js routes using an app called Insomnia. Direct students to the [Insomnia download page](https://insomnia.rest/download) and advise them to have it installed before the next unit.

* Students will also start using Heroku in the upcoming unit. Advise them to sign up for a Heroku account and install the Heroku CLI before they start the next unit. Direct students to the [Heroku CLI installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/heroku/how-to-install-the-heroku-cli) for extra guidance.

* Mocks are taught in Lesson 2, and ES6 classes are taught in Lesson 5.

## Office Hours

Encourage students to work on the remaining module algorithms during Office Hours. Review the algorithm solutions 5–10 minutes before class begins.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What did you learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

  * 🙋 We learned about object-oriented programming (OOP). We used constructors, classes, prototypes, and Jest for TDD. We are moving fast compared to traditional learners. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed -- just don’t give up!

  * ☝️ Did anyone have an "A-ha!" or "Eureka!" moment this week? When was it and why did things suddenly click for you?

  * 🙋 Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we are thinking about it.

  * ☝️ Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

  * 🙋 It's easy to get stuck when you are learning web development. It's important to learn how to get unstuck because it happens to the pros too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the tool's official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups are helpful because explaining your obstacles to someone else often reveals the solution.

### 2. Review Current Challenge (5 min)

* In the command line, navigate to `02-Challenge/Main` and run `node app.js` to demonstrate the following:

  * This Challenge is to build a Node.js CLI that takes in information about multiple employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

  * The application prompts the user for information about the team manager and then for information about the team members.

  * When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What recently acquired skills will help us build this Challenge?

  * 🙋 Jest for unit testing, ES6 classes, and `inquirer` for collecting input from the user.

  * ☝️ How are these skills relevant to a career in web development?

  * 🙋 Because many employers require programming in TDD, knowing how to write effective unit tests is crucial to your career success.

  * ☝️ How will this Challenge improve your portfolio?

  * 🙋 It will demonstrate a firm understanding of Node.js fundamentals, as well as ES6 and unit testing.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 3. Instructor Demo: First Mock (5 min)

* In the command line, navigate to `03-First-Mock/Solved` and run `node index.js` to demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 When we run `node index.js`, we see a printout of the names and ages of several children at a daycare center. We also notice that the list changes after an event occurs, such as `Picked up Amir from day care`.

    ```js
    [
      Child { name: 'Amir', age: 3 },
      Child { name: 'Zhang Wei', age: 1 },
      Child { name: 'Kyle', age: 2 }
    ]

    At capacity, unable to add more children
    [
      Child { name: 'Amir', age: 3 },
      Child { name: 'Zhang Wei', age: 1 },
      Child { name: 'Kyle', age: 2 }
    ]

    Picked up Amir from day care
    [ Child { name: 'Zhang Wei', age: 1 }, Child { name: 'Kyle', age: 2 } ]

    [
      Child { name: 'Zhang Wei', age: 1 },
      Child { name: 'Kyle', age: 2 },
      Child { name: 'Rosie', age: 1 }
    ]

    Picked up Zhang Wei from day care
    Unable to add child, they are over the age limit
    [ Child { name: 'Kyle', age: 2 }, Child { name: 'Rosie', age: 1 } ]
    ```

  * These console logs are essential to the functioning of the app. Using Jest, we can spy on the functionality of these console logs to make sure they are actually working as expected.

* In your IDE, navigate to `03-First-Mock/Solved/test/dayCare.test.js` and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We add Jest's `spyOn()` method to the test to mock and track the `console.log` method to see if it is functioning as we expect.

    ```js
    const mock = jest.spyOn(console, "log");
    ```

  * 🔑 We then use the `mock.mockImplementation()` method to temporarily wrap the functionality of `console.log()` with an empty function that does nothing.

    ```js
    mock.mockImplementation(() => { });
    ```

  * 🔑 Next, we use the `expect()` method to set the expectation that the `console.log` be called and to return a message in the log. Because we are mocking the `console.log()` method, nothing will actually be printed to the console when the test is run.

    ```js
      expect(mock).toBeCalledWith(
      "Unable to add child, they are over the age limit"
    );
    ```

  * 🔑 Finally, after we run the test to spy on the `console.log`, we want to restore the original functionality. To do so, we use the `mockRestore` method.

    ```js
      mock.mockRestore();
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We used mocks in Lesson 2. Mocking is part of test-driven development (TDD) and helps us gain insight on the code's behavior so we can write more durable code.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

  * 🙋 Using mocking and the `spyOn` method allows us to track existing functions and code behavior. Although not required, this can be used to test the functionality of the Challenge code. Mocking also prompts us to proactively think about the behavior and outcomes of code, which will ultimately help us write better, more predictable code as developers.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We use Jest's `spyOn` method to track functionality, like a `console.log` in the code.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: First Mock (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `03-First-Mock/README.md`, which are also shown here:

  ```md
   # 🐛 Running npm run test Results in Errors

  Work with a partner to resolve the following issue:

  * As a developer, I want the tests for `dayCare.test.js` to pass when I run `npm install` and `npm run test` in the console.

  ## Expected Behavior

  * When we run `npm run test` in the console, we should not receive an error.

  * When we run `npm run test` in the console, the tests for `dayCare.test.js` should pass.

  ## Actual Behavior

  * When we run `npm run test` in the console, we receive the following error: `"Cannot spyOn on a primitive value; undefined given"`.

  * When we run `npm run test` in the console, the tests for `dayCare.test.js` do not pass.

  ## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

  To reproduce the problem, follow these steps:

  1. Navigate to the `Unsolved` folder in this activity.

  2. In the console, run `npm install`.

  3. In the console, run `npm run test`.

  ## Assets

  The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

  ![The console indicates that the test suites and tests have passed, with no messages or errors displayed.](./images/image.png)

  ---

  ## 💡 Hints

  What does the error tell you about what is missing, and how do we capture the value of `console.log`?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What are two or three other methods that can be used in conjunction with `spyOn`?

  Use the [Jest API documentation on spyOn()](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/jest-object#jestspyonobject-methodname) to research this.
  ```

### 5. Instructor Review: First Mock (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points (✔️):

  * ✔️ `jest.spyOn()`

  * ✔️ `mock.mockImplementation()`

* In your IDE, open `03-First-Mock/Solved/test/dayCare.test.js` and explain the following:

  * 🔑 Using `jest.spyOn()`, we pass in the arguments `console` and `"log"` to spy on the `console.log()` method.

    ```js
    const mock = jest.spyOn(console, "log");
    ```

  * 🔑 We pass in an empty function to `mock.mockImplementation()` to replace the functionality of the `console.log()` method.

    ```js
    mock.mockImplementation(() => { });
    ```

  * Now we can use `expect(mock).toBeCalledWith()` to verify that it was called with the arguments that we expect.

    ```js
    const mock = jest.spyOn(console, "log");
    mock.mockImplementation(() => {});

    dayCare.addChild(child);

    expect(dayCare.children.length).toEqual(0);
    expect(mock).toBeCalledWith(
      "Unable to add child, they are over the age limit"
    );
    ```

  * We will clean up any mocks that we run at the end of a test to ensure that the next test is not affected. We can "unmock" `console.log()` by using the `mock.mockRestore()` method.

    ```js
    mock.mockRestore();
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What can we use Jest's `spyOn()` method for?

  * 🙋 We can use Jest's `spyOn()` method to spy on the behavior of a function instead of just testing the output.

  * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 2, read the [Jest API documentation on spyOn()](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/jest-object#jestspyonobject-methodname), and attend Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Classes (5 min)

* In the command line, navigate to `04-Classes/Solved` and run `node character.js` to demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 When we run the `character.js` file in the console, a game is displayed. This game uses ES6 classes.

  * 🔑 These ES6 classes are blueprints for creating objects.

* In your IDE, navigate to `04-Classes/Solved/character.js` to demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We use the `class` keyword to declare a class.

    ```js
    class Character {...}
    ```

  * 🔑 We then use a constructor to create and initialize an object. This constructor describes the `name`, `strength`, and `hitPoints` of the object.

    ```js
    constructor(name, strength, hitPoints) {
      this.name = name;
      this.strength = strength;
      this.hitPoints = hitPoints;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 We then use methods to describe the functionality associated with the object. For example, we can add a method that checks whether the object is alive based on the number of `hitPoints` it has remaining.

    ```js
    isAlive() {
      if (this.hitPoints <= 0) {
        console.log(`${this.name} has been defeated!`);
        return false;
      }
      return true;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 When we create an ES6 class, we are essentially creating a template that describes the characteristics and functionality for a group of objects. To create an object, we use the `new` operator and assign values. The new object will inherit all of the characteristics of its class. For example, the new object `grace` will have a `name`, `strength`, and `hitPoints`.

  * 🔑 To provide a value for the `name`, `strength`, and `hitPoints`, we add the values as parameters. These values will be unique to `grace`.

    ```js
    const grace = new Character('Grace', 30, 75);
    ```

  * Because the new object `grace` has inherited all of the characteristics of the `Character` class, the `grace` object has access to the methods. To check whether the new character `grace` is out of `hitPoints` and no longer alive, we call the `.isAlive()` method on `grace`. In this case, we are actually checking whether the `grace` character is not alive, so the not `!` operator has been added.

    ```js
    !grace.isAlive()
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We used ES6 classes in Lesson 5 when we converted constructor functions, like `Potion()` and `Player()`, to ES6 classes.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

  * 🙋 The Challenge uses ES6 classes for the `Employee`, `Manager`, `Engineer`, and `Intern` objects.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We will declare a class using the `class` keyword and then use the constructor method to initiate the object. We can also add methods to add functionality to the class object.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Classes (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Classes/README.md`, which are also shown here:

  ```md
  # 🏗️ Write and Implement Classes

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a user, I want a command-line role-playing game (RPG) that allows two characters to battle each other.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It is done when a new `Character` can be created with the following properties:

    * `name` is a string that contains the character's name.

    * `strength` is a number that indicates how much damage the character's attacks will inflict.

    * `hitPoints` is a number that indicates how many hit points the character has.

  * It is done when each `Character` has the following methods:

    * `printStats()` logs the character's name, strength, and hit points, as follows:

      ```js
      console.log(`Stats for ${this.name} are:\n`)
      console.log(`Each attack will do ${this.strength} damage`)
      console.log(`${this.name} has ${this.hitPoints} hit points remaining`)
      ```

    * `isAlive()` returns a Boolean value based on whether or not a character's hit points are less than or equal to zero.

    * `attack()` accepts an opposing `Character` object and subtracts the current character's `strength` from the opponent's `hitPoints`.

  * It is done when I can run `node character.js` and see two instances of `Character` battle each other until one of them is defeated.

  ---

  ## 💡 Hints

  How can you start small? Can you benefit from first trying to make one character attack another until the game is over?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * How can we add validation to ensure that each character is provided the proper three arguments when created?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 8. Instructor Review: Classes (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points (✔️):

  * ✔️ `constructor()`

  * ✔️ `this`

  * ✔️ Method syntax

* Open `04-Classes/Solved/character.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 The `Character` class includes a `constructor()` method that accepts three arguments.

    ```js
    class Character {
      constructor(name, strength, hitPoints) {
        this.name = name;
        this.strength = strength;
        this.hitPoints = hitPoints;
      }
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 The `printStats()` method uses `this` to reference the current character's properties.

    ```js
    printStats() {
      console.log(`Stats for ${this.name} are as following:`);
      console.log(`Each attack will do ${this.strength} damage.`);
      console.log(`${this.name} has ${this.hitPoints} hit points remaining!`);
      console.log("------------");
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 The `isAlive()` method returns `false` if `this.hitPoints` is less than zero.

    ```js
    isAlive() {
      if (this.hitPoints <= 0) {
        console.log(`${this.name} has been defeated!`)
        return false;
      }
      return true;
    };
    ```

  * The `attack()` method updates the object being passed in as the argument.

    ```js
    attack(opponent) {
      console.log(`${this.name} hit ${opponent.name} for ${this.strength}`)
      opponent.hitPoints -= this.strength;
    };
    ```

  * We use the `new` keyword to create two new `Character` instances.

    ```js
    const grace = new Character("Grace", 30, 75);
    const dijkstra = new Character("Dijkstra", 20, 105);
    ```

  * We use `setInterval()` to run a game loop, using the `graceTurn` variable to swap who should attack first each time.

    ```js
    let graceTurn = true;

    const turnInterval = setInterval(() => {
      if(!grace.isAlive() || !dijkstra.isAlive()) {
        clearInterval(turnInterval);
        console.log("Game over!");
      } else if(graceTurn) {
        grace.attack(dijkstra);
        dijkstra.printStats();
      } else {
        dijkstra.attack(grace);
        grace.printStats();
      }

      graceTurn = !graceTurn;
    }, 2000);
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are some differences between constructor functions and classes?

  * 🙋 ES6 classes must be called with the `new` keyword. With ES5 constructors, you could call `Character()` on its own. The other difference is that ES6 classes are not hoisted.

  * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 5, read the [MDN Web Docs on Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes), and attend Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Instructor Demo: Multiple Classes (5 min)

* In Javascript, when we write an ES6 class, the class should provide the blueprint for a single object. To use a real-world example, if we have both a table and a chair, we would need two blueprints to build them. When using classes, you will often have more than one class in your code.

* In the command line, navigate to `05-Multiple-Classes/Solved/` and run `node index.js` to demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 In this command-line app, we've built an interface for a store called Big Al's Toy Barn. Taking a look at the output, it looks like we might need to have more than one class to create blueprints for the objects.

* Navigate to `05-Multiple-Classes/Solved/toy.js` in your IDE to demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 Let's start small. Big Al's toy store will need toys. And each toy will need a name, price, and count.

    ```js
    class Toy {
      constructor(name, price, count) {
      this.name = name;
      this.price = price;
      this.count = count;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 Now that we have a blueprint, we can make some toy objects. We use the `new` operator to create two toy objects in an array and export everything so we can use it in other parts of the code.

    ```js
    const toys = [
      new Toy("Action Figure", 14.99, 5),
      new Toy("Rare Toy", 17.99, 1)
    ];

    module.exports = {
      Toy,
      toys
    };
    ```

  * Notice that we are keeping all the code needed for the toys in a separate file. This modular method will help keep the code clean and make it much easier to write unit tests for the code. This is an important step, especially as the code gets bigger.

* Navigate to `05-Multiple-Classes/Solved/store.js` in your IDE to demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 In order to sell the toys, we need a blueprint for Big Al's store. We declare a store class, initialize it with a constructor, and give it some methods that will be used to perform store-related tasks.

    ```js
    class Store {
        constructor(name, stock) {
          this.name = name;
          this.stock = stock;
          this.revenue = 0;
      }
      processProductSale(name) {
        this.stock.forEach(item => {
          if (item.name === name) {
            if (item.count > 0) {
              item.count--;
              this.revenue += item.price;
                console.log(`Purchased ${item.name} for ${item.price}`);
              } else {
                console.log(`Sorry, ${item.name} is out of stock!`);
              }
            }
          });
        }
      replenishStock(name, count) {
        this.stock.forEach(item => {
          if (item.name === name) {
            item.count += count;
              console.log(`Replenished ${item.name} by ${item.count}`);
            }
          });
        }
      printRevenue() {
        console.log(`The revenue so far is ${this.revenue}`);
      }
      welcome() {
        console.log(`Welcome to ${this.name}!`);
      }
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 We then export the `Store` class, so we can use it elsewhere in the code.

      ```js
      module.exports = Store;
      ```

* In your IDE, navigate to `05-Multiple-Classes/Solved/index.js` to demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 Now that we have both the toy objects and the Store class, we can put it all together. We create a new instance of the store, give it the name `Big Al's Toy Barn`, and set the stock value to be the array of toys.

    ```js
    const store = new Store("Big Al's Toy Barn", toys);
    ```

  * Now the store's stock will be populated by the toy objects, so the store can perform the needed inventory operations.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We practiced ES6 classes in Lesson 5.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

  * 🙋 For the Challenge, we will be required to create multiple classes and organize the code to maintain separation of concerns. The code is easier to navigate if we give each class a distinct responsibility.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 When we plan an app, we first think about each object that we will need to use and how they might interact. Then, we declare each class with the class keyword and initialize each class with a constructor function.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 10. Student Do: Multiple Classes (20 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `05-Multiple-Classes/README.md`, which are also shown here:

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What is the `static` keyword, and when would we use static methods?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 11. Instructor Review: Multiple Classes (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points (✔️):

  * ✔️ `class` keyword

  * ✔️ `processProductSale()`

  * ✔️ `replenishStock()`

  * ✔️ `const store = new Store("Big Al's Toy Barn", toys);`

* In your IDE, open `05-Multiple-Classes/Solved/store.js` and explain the following:

  * Now that we have spent time reverse-engineering the code, let's take a closer look.

  * We can create a new store by passing in the `name` and `stock` properties. For each new instance of the `Store` class, the constructor will set `revenue` to `0`. When we initialize a new instance of the store, we will give the store a name and set the value of `stock` to be equal to the toy objects.

    ```js
    class Store {
      constructor(name, stock) {
      this.name = name;
      this.stock = stock;
      this.revenue = 0;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 We also write methods to describe actions we want to perform. In the `processProductSale()` method, we loop through each stock item in the store. Once we've found one with a name that matches the item we want to process, we decrease its count by 1 and increase the store's revenue by the price of the item.

    ```js
    processProductSale(name) {
      this.stock.forEach(item => {
        if (item.name === name) {
          if (item.count > 0) {
            item.count--;
            this.revenue += item.price;
            console.log(`Purchased ${item.name} for ${item.price}`);
          } else {
            console.log(`Sorry, ${item.name} is out of stock!`);
          }
        }
      });
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 In `replenishStock()`, we find the matching item by name and increase its count by the specified number.

    ```js
    replenishStock(name, count) {
      this.stock.forEach(item => {
        if (item.name === name) {
          item.count += count;
          console.log(`Replenished ${item.name} by ${item.count}`);
        }
      });
    }
    ```

* Open `05-Multiple-Classes/Solved/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We put it all together in the `index.js` file. First, we make sure the `Store` class and toys are imported.

    ```js
    const Store = require('./store');
    const { toys } = require('./toy');
    ```

  * 🔑 Then we use the `new` operator to create a new `Store` instance with the name of the store. We also set the value of `stock` to equal the toy objects.

    ```js
    const store = new Store("Big Al's Toy Barn", toys);
    ```

  * Now that the new store has access to the toy objects, we simply call the store's methods to handle the store's inventory.

    ```js
    store.replenishStock('Rare Toy', 2);
    store.processProductSale('Rare Toy');
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 5, read the [MDN Web Docs on classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes), and attend Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 12. Recap & Promote Additional Resources (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What do you think you absolutely need to know to succeed at the Challenge?

  * 🙋 We will need to know ES6 classes, and understand how to read test outputs to fix the code to make the tests pass.

  * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

  * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it is not necessary to completely understand any one area to be successful.

  * ☝️ Why is it important to complete as much of the lesson material prior to class as possible?

  * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared for the Challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build on in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

* Direct students to the following additional resources available to them:

  * Reflection and Retrieval

  * Career Connection

  * Dessert Menu

### 13. Introduce the Upcoming Challenge (5 min)

* In the command line, navigate to `01-Class-Content/11-Express/02-Challenge/Main/` and run `node server.js` to demonstrate the following:

  * The upcoming Challenge is to create a Note Taker application that can be used to write and save notes.

  * This application will use an Express.js back end, and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

  * I can add a note and it will show up in the left-hand column with all the other existing notes.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are we learning?

  * 🙋 We are learning to use Express.js for the back end. We are also deploying the application to Heroku.

  * ☝️ How does this project build on or extend previously learned material?

  * 🙋 We are continuing to build on our knowledge of Node.js and API routes. We are continuing to use ES6.

  * ☝️ How does this project relate to your career goals?

  * 🙋 Express.js is the most widely used Node.js server framework. It will allow us to quickly and easily establish the API routes and associated HTTP request methods.

* Answer any questions before ending the class.
