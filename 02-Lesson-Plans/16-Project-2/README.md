# Module 16 Instructor Overview: Project 2 (Continued)

## Overview

In this week's virtual classes, students will continue working on their projects, deploy their projects, and present their projects as groups to their classmates. 

## Virtual Classes

[Virtual Class 16.2](./16.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* There is no lesson plan for the first virtual class this week. Use the entirety of the class time as office hours to assist students with their projects. In place of lecture and activities, hold stand-up meetings with each group to gauge progress and advise as necessary.

* Share the [Project Presentation Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10QaO9KH8HtUXj__81ve0SZcpO5DbMbqqQr4iPpbwKks/edit?usp=sharing) with students early in the week to give them ample time to prepare for their presentations.

* Prepare a slide deck of superlative awards to give to each group. Use [this example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QlPJhHnHvLLtKheKl4opm7tibkjjALZeAzwVvZdJDO0/edit?usp=sharing), and feel free to customize it as you see fit for your cohort.

* Divide this week's second virtual class time by the number of groups presenting to give each group sufficient time to discuss their projects. Be sure to leave time for you and the TAs to present superlatives at the end of class.

* Be prepared to demonstrate the [Module 17 Challenge](../../01-Class-Content/17-CS/02-Challenge) at the end of the second virtual class, after presentations.

## Career Connection

During each lesson that students work through, they will also view a Career Connection section that will tie together the academic content with career services and how this material will be applicable to them in their future career.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Coach and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp).

If you'd like more information on career services, visit the [career services resources page](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp).

## Heads-Up

* Next week, students will learn Computer Science fundamentals as they apply to JavaScript. Let the students know that this next module will look very different from what they're used to! It is heavier on concepts, but it will help them think like a developer and prepare them for interviews. 

* This last phase of the boot camp is more about being employer-ready, improving the skills they have already learned, and making their web applications more performant and efficient. Basically, students will focus on "Life after Boot Camp".
