# Module 16 Virtual Class (Required): Project 2 (Continued)

## Overview 

In today's required virtual class, students will present their projects in groups.


## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Demonstrate deployed projects

* Explain the technical implementation of their projects

* Describe their individual roles and contributions to their projects


## Instructor Notes 

* Keep an eye on time to ensure every group has an opportunity to present. 

* This is a major milestone for students. Be sure to congratulate them!

* If you haven't already, prepare [Superlative Awards](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QlPJhHnHvLLtKheKl4opm7tibkjjALZeAzwVvZdJDO0/edit?usp=sharing) to give each group at the end of this session.

## Office Hours

Use office hours to assist with any last minute debugging and deployment issues, or providing feedback on presentations.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What did you learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

    * 🙋 We learned how to design, build, and deploy a full-stack web application! We also learned to work collaboratively as a team.

    * ☝️ Did anyone have an "Aha!" or "Eureka!" moment this week? When was it and why did things suddenly click for you? 

    * 🙋 Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we're thinking about it.

    * ☝️ Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

    * 🙋 It's easy to get stuck when you're learning web development. It's important to learn how to get unstuck because it happens to the pros too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the tool's official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups are great because explaining your problems to someone else often reveals the solution. 


### 2. Project Presentations & Superlatives (100 min)

* Divide this time block by the number of student groups presenting.

* Present superlative 'awards' and congratulate each group for accomplishing this huge milestone!

### 3. Recap & Promote Additional Resources (5 min)

* Direct students to the additional resources available to them:

    * Reflection and Retrieval

    * Career Connection

### 4. Introduce Upcoming Challenge (5 min)

* Navigate to `01-Class-Content/17-CS/02-Challenge/Master` in your command line and demonstrate the following: 

    * The upcoming challenge is to create a gist on GitHub that will be a tutorial on regex.

    * You will first need to familiarize yourself with regex. Then you will need to learn how to create a gist on GitHub. 

    * This challenge is unlike the previous challenges that you've worked on! It is focused more on helping you think like a developer, rather than having you do a strict coding exercise. 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What are we learning?

    * 🙋 We are learning to communicate technical knowledge to others by writing a tutorial that explains Regular Expressions, or regex. Whether it is in writing, like a tech blog, or in speech, like during a technical interview, the ability to clearly explain difficult technical concepts is an important skill to have as a developer. 

    * ☝️ How does this project build off or extend previously learned material?

    * 🙋 After creating this tutorial on regex, you should be able to write technical walkthroughs about the different languages and skills you've learned so far in this boot camp. 

    * ☝️ How does this project relate to your career goals?

    * 🙋 As a developer, you will need to be able to clearly explain and communicate technical knowledge, whether it is talking about a project within your team at work or giving a presentation of your product in front of executives.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Office Hours (30 min)

* Announce Office Hours and encourage students to stay on the Zoom and start the challenge while they have live support from instructional staff. 

### 6. End
