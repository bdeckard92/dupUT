# Module 20 Virtual Class: React

## Overview

In today's virtual class, students will work with React components and props and write JSX expressions to render elements to the page.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Explain and use props to pass data to child React components.

* Explain the concept of state within a React app.

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* The first activity for this module will use `npx create-react-app`. The `npx` command allows us to run an executable binary locally without needing to install it globally first. In the context of React, it also ensures that students use the latest version of the utility.

* When using the `create-react-app` utility to create a React app, the project directory will also automatically be created as part of the process. Students might be tempted to start by creating a directory for their project, which is not necessary and might actually cause some confusion. The name you provide to the command will be the directory name -- for example, `npx create-react-app my-app` creates a directory called `/my-app`. The name `my-app` will also be used as the name of the project inside the `package.json` file that is generated.

* The practice app will be called `00-practice-app`, but the name isn't as important as it's location. The `00-practice-app` directory will be created in the `01-Activities` directory.

* **Important**: In order to avoid continuous NPM installs, all of today's activities' Solved and Unsolved folders include only a `src` folder. Swap out the `src` folder for each activity in `00-practice-app`. It's recommended that you completely restart the dev server between activities.

* **Important:** To avoid errors due to conflicting versions of ESLint in the repo, navigate to `00-practice-app` in the command line and run the following command:

  ```sh
  echo "SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true" > .env
  ```

* Several activities in this unit require students to import Bootstrap into the `/src/index.js` file. If students ask why their activities do not match the solution, check whether they've done this.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms and check if the group is having any problems using `00-practice-app` for their activities.

* Props and state were covered in Lesson 3.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Invite students to post questions in the Zoom chat so TAs and/or the instructor can address them at the end of class.

* Open the lesson's [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14XK83zDCSaS4B6vM67GjvVIGEZu5CLxXs8vRf6OFX0M/edit?usp=sharing) and walk through the following slides on foundation setting:

    **Big Picture**: This is an opportunity to look at the big picture of where students are in the course. Take a moment to discuss a few real-world examples of why this week's topics are valuable.

    **Boot Camp Pointers**: Review some logistics that will help students stay on track. This is an opportunity to speak to what students might need at this particular point in the course.

    **This Week**: Review the key skills students will be learning this week.

    **This Week's Assignment**: Give a quick summary of this week's Challenge assignment and describe how the skills they learn throughout the week will be applied to it.

    **Career Connection**: Reinforce that students will use the skills they learn this week throughout their careers. It's important for them to know the "why" and "how" behind the "what." Give examples of how these skills are used on the job. If you feel comfortable, share examples of how you have used them in your professional career.

    * Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

        * ☝ This week, we're learning React, which you've likely already heard of throughout the boot camp from time to time. Is anyone familiar with any other web frameworks or libraries?

        * 🙋 Yes! Angular and Vue are two other popular frameworks/libraries.

        * ☝ Right. So why do we teach React?

        * 🙋 React is currently the most popular framework on the market, with rising demand every year.

        * ☝ And when you're looking for jobs, should you also apply to positions that want Angular and Vue developers even though we don't teach them in this course?

        * 🙋 Yes, because the skills are directly transferrable among frameworks! The frameworks are all fairly similar with just a few key differences among them.

    **How to Succeed This Week**: Remind students that they might experience moments of frustration as they learn complex concepts and tools, and that these times are actually proven opportunities to deepen knowledge. Consider sharing something about your personal learning journey. This helps students recognize that everyone starts somewhere and that they are not alone.

    **Today's Objectives**: Outline the concepts that will be covered in today's lesson. Remind students that they can find the relevant activity files in the "Getting Ready for Class" page in their course content.

### 2. Instructor Do: Student Check-In (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

    * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back at what we accomplished and acknowledge that it's a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed&mdash;as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic?

    * 🙋 Let's do Fist to Five together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 3. Instructor Demo: Props (5 min)

* Open `20-React/01-Activities` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * First, we need to create a practice React application that we will use for all of our class activities for this module. You can follow along as I demonstrate this.

* In the command line, navigate to `20-React/01-Activities` and run the following command:

  ```sh
  npx create-react-app 00-practice-app
  ```

  * 🔑 When we run this command, the npm package runner, `npx`, will execute the latest version of the `create-react-app` utility.

  * 🔑 We can see that `create-react-app` runs a series of scripts to create a new directory, repository, and folder structure for a boilerplate React application.

  * We can deduce that the argument after `create-react-app` is the name of the application that we want to create, `00-practice-app`.

  * This process might take some time to complete. When it's done, you will see a boilerplate application in the `00-practice-app` directory.

  * For each subsequent activity in this class, we will remove the `/src` directory in `00-practice-app` and replace it with the `/src` directory in the activity's `/Unsolved` folder. Let's practice that now with our first activity, except I will demo the Solved activity.

  * 🔑 First, we need to copy the [src](../../01-Class-Content/20-React/01-Activities/01-Props/Solved/src) folder and paste it into the `00-practice-app`.

  * 🔑 Then we navigate to `00-practice-app` and start the app in dev mode by running `npm start` from the command line.

  * 🔑 This will automatically open the browser to <http://localhost:3000>.

  * 🔑 We will see a list of cards displaying Corgis with a button on each card.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used this in Lesson 3 with the Nav component.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

    * 🙋 We will need to pass props into our components.

    * ☝️ How will we build a new React app for each subsequent activity?

    * 🙋 We will delete the `00-practice-app/src` directory and replace it with the one found in `Unsolved/src` for each activity.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Props (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-Props/README.md`, which are also shown here:

  ```md
  # 🏗️ Pass Data Using Props

  Initializing a React application by using the `create-react-app` command-line utility can take some time. To save time throughout this unit, we will create one React application and only replace the `/src` files for each subsequent activity as we work on them. Before you add comments to the code, you will practice the workflow for creating a React app and updating your practice app for subsequent activities.

  To do this, follow these steps:

    1. In the command line, navigate to `20-React/01-Activities`.

    2. Run the command `npx create-react-app 00-practice-app`.

    3. After `create-react-app` has completed (which can take a few minutes), run the command `npm i bootstrap dotenv --save` to add dependencies that we will need in later activities.

    4. Delete the `/src` folder in [00-practice-app](../00-practice-app/).

    5. Copy the `/src` folder from [Unsolved](./Unsolved/) and paste it into [00-practice-app](../00-practice-app/).

    6. This project uses Bootstrap, so don't forget to import it inside `index.js`:

    `import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'`

  ## Activity

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to render multiple cards for different animals by passing props to each one.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  The activity is done when it meets the following criteria:

  * It's done when I have updated the return method in `src/components/Display.js` to render a `Card` for each dog.

  * It's done when I have passed data for each dog's `name` and `description` as props to the `Card`.

  * It's done when I have added a unique `key` property to each `Card` that gets rendered.

  ## 💡 Hints

  * How can we use the [React Docs on components and props](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/components-and-props.html) to understand props better?

  * What is the term **props** short for?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * How could we use the [style tag](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/dom-elements.html#style) to add additional style to our React components?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 5. Instructor Review: Props (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ Props

  * ✔️ Unidirectional data flow

  * ✔️ `.map()`

* Open `01-Props/Solved/src/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * First we need to open the `index.js` file and import Bootstrap to style the cards:

     ```js
     import React from 'react';
     import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
     import App from './App';
     import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';

     ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
     ```

* Open `01-Props/Solved/src/components/Display.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * The first thing we notice is that we are importing another component called `Card` at the top of the file. We will look more closely at this component later in the activity.

  * Inside the `Display` component, we have an array of objects called `canines`. Each object within that array contains the `name` and `description` of dogs:

     ```js
     import React from 'react';
     import Card from './Card';

     const canines = [
       {
         name: 'Spot',
         description: 'The best boy',
         id: 1,
       },
       {
         name: 'Zero',
         description: 'A kind soul',
         id: 2,
       },
       {
         name: 'Walter',
         description: 'Friend for life',
         id: 3,
       },
     ];
     ```

* Open `01-Props/Solved/src/components/Card.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * The `Card` component imports React at the top of the file:

     ```js
     import React from 'react';
     ```

  * We pass the props argument to the `Card` component so that we can reference the data passed from the parent:

     ```js
     export default function Card(props) {
     ```

  * In the return statement for the card, we take the `name` and `description` that were passed as props and render them in the Bootstrap card:

     ```jsx
     return (
       <div>
         <div className="card" style={cardStyle}>
           <img
             className="card-img-top"
             src={`http://placecorgi.com/${randomWidth()}`}
             alt="Card cap"
           />
           <div className="card-body">
             <h5 className="card-title">{props.name}</h5>
             <p className="card-text">{props.description}</p>
             <a href="#" className="btn btn-primary">
               Adopt {props.name}
             </a>
           </div>
         </div>
       </div>
     );
     ```

* Open `01-Props/Solved/src/components/Display.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * Now that we've looked at the `Card` component and what it does, let's check what is happening in the return statement for `Display`.

  * First map through each of the animals and return a new `Card` component for each dog.

  * Each card is made unique to that dog by the props that we pass to it -- specifically, the `name` and `description` props.

  * 🔑 It is important to provide a unique `key` attribute when mapping through lists like this one. It helps React distinguish one element from another:

     ```js
     export default function Display() {
       return (
         <div>
           {canines.map((dog) => (
             <Card name={dog.name} description={dog.description} key={dog.id} />
           ))}
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are some different ways that we can pass props to a child component?

  * 🙋 We can pass props to the child component by passing a `props` object as an argument, or we can use object destructuring assignment.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [React Docs on props](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: State (5 min)

* Open `02-State/Solved` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 Again, we will need to copy the [src](../../01-Class-Content/20-React/01-Activities/02-State/Solved/src) folder and replace the `src` folder in the `00-practice-app` app with this one.

  * 🔑 Then we navigate to `00-practice-app` and start the app in dev mode by running `npm start` from the command line.

  * 🔑 This will automatically open the browser to <http://localhost:3000>.

  * 🔑 There is a list of users with a welcome message above them.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used the `useState` hook in Lesson 3 to manage the categories.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

    * 🙋 We will be using React Hooks in the Challenge to manage state within a component.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We need to use `useState` in order to declare a new state variable access those variables inside the JSX.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: State (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-State/README.md`, which are also shown here:

  ```md
  # 🐛 Hardcoded Values in JSX

  ## Before We Begin

  Before you begin this activity, complete the following steps:

  1. Delete the `/src` folder in [00-practice-app](../00-practice-app/).

  2. Copy the `/src` folder from [Unsolved](./Unsolved/src/) and paste it into [00-practice-app](../00-practice-app/).

  3. Import Bootstrap into the [index.js](./Unsolved/src/index.js) file:

    `import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'`

  ## Activity

  Work with a partner to resolve the following issue:

  * As a user, I want to be able to welcome some students to class by displaying their names in an unordered list on the page along with a welcome message.

  * As a developer, I want to use state variables using the `useState` hook and access those variables inside the JSX.

  ## Expected Behavior

  Loading the page will show a greeting message and a list of students from the class in an unordered list. These values should be declared as state variables using the `useState` Hook and accessed inside the JSX with curly braces.

  ## Actual Behavior

  The page seems to have hardcoded values inside the JSX for the greeting and student names.

  ## 💡 Hints

  * What do we need to import in order to use the `useState` Hook?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What are some other Hooks that we can use with React?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 8. Instructor Review: State (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `useState` Hook

  * ✔️ Default state values

* Open `02-State/Solved/src/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * First we want to import Bootstrap to make sure that the `className` attributes apply the proper styles to the page:

    ```js
    import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
    ```

* Open `02-State/Solved/src/App.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * Inside the `App.js` file, we can see that we import something called `Greeting.js` and return it in the `App` component:

    ```js
    import React from "react";
    import Greeting from "./components/Greeting";

    function App() {
      return <Greeting />;
    }

    export default App;
    ```

* Open `02-State/Solved/src/components/Greeting.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * To use the `useState` Hook from React, we have to modify the import statement at the top of the file:

    ```js
    import React, { useState } from 'react';
    ```

  * With the `useState` Hook, we declare a state variable called `greeting` and a function to update `setGreeting`. The `useState` Hook accepts only one argument, which will be the initial value for `greeting`. In this case, this is `Welcome the following students to class!`:

    ```js
    function Greeting() {
      const [greeting, setGreeting] = useState('Welcome the following students to class!');
    ```

  * Because the app will render a list of students, we also want to create a state variable called `group`. This will be an array that contains a few students from the class. Notice that we immediately set an initial value for the state variable with three names:

    ```js
    const [group, setGroup] = useState(["John", "Grace", "Jared"]);
    ```

  * In the return statement, we see the JSX that will render when this component loads. We use curly braces to render the greeting inside a `p` tag.

  * We also created a unordered list that will display the name of each person in `group` by accessing the array index position:

    ```js
    return (
      <div className="card text-center">
        <div className="card-header bg-primary text-white">State activity!</div>
        <div className="card-body">
          <p className="card-text">{greeting}</p>
          <ul>
            <li>{group[0]}</li>
            <li>{group[1]}</li>
            <li>{group[2]}</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
    );
    ```

  * 🔑 Remember that, for React to function properly, state variables shouldn't be updated directly. The **virtual DOM (VDOM)** only knows to update when the state of the application has changed. For this reason, if we wanted to update `greeting`, for example, we would use the method that is returned from the `useState` Hook, `setGreeting()`.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What two things does `useState` return?

  * 🙋 `useState` returns the state variable and a function to update it.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [React Docs on useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding.

### 9. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

    * 🙋 We learned about props and React Hooks, mainly `useState`.

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful.

    * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

    * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the Challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

    * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

    * 🙋 Props and state are covered in Lesson 3.

    * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Use student answers to transition to Office Hours.

### 10. Challenge Review (30 min)

* Take this time to help get students unblocked on the current Challenge that they are working through.

* Expect that students may ask for the following:

  * Further review on a particular subject

  * Debugging assistance

  * Help with computer issues

  * Guidance with a particular tool
