# Module 20 Virtual Class: React

## Overview 

In today's virtual class, students will use the `.map()` method to render JSX from an array of objects. Students will also use the React `useState` Hook to use state variables in a functional component.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Map over an array and render the items on the page

* Use the `useState` Hook to use state variables

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have. 

* **Important**: In order to avoid continuous NPM installs, all of today's activities' Solved and Unsolved folders include only a `src` folder. Use the given React app `00-React-App` and swap out the `src` folder for each activity. It's recommended that you completely restart the dev server between activities.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms and check if the group is having any problems using `00-React-App` for their activities.

* Mapping and rendering JSX on the page was covered in Lesson 1, and `useState` was covered in Lesson 3.

## Class Instructions 

### 1. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Invite students to post questions in the Zoom chat so TAs and/or the instructor can address them at the end of class.

* Open the lesson's [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14XK83zDCSaS4B6vM67GjvVIGEZu5CLxXs8vRf6OFX0M/edit?usp=sharing) and walk through the following slides on foundation setting:
 
    **Big Picture**: This is an opportunity to look at the big picture of where students are in the course. Take a moment to discuss a few real-world examples of why this week's topics are valuable.

    **Boot Camp Pointers**: Review some logistics that will help students stay on track. This is an opportunity to speak to what students might need at this particular point in the course. 

    **This Week**: Review the key skills students will be learning this week. 

    **This Week's Assignment**: Give a quick summary of this week's Challenge assignment and describe how the skills they learn throughout the week will be applied to it.

    **Career Connection**: Reinforce that students will use the skills they learn this week throughout their careers. It's important for them to know the "why" and "how" behind the "what." Give examples of how these skills are used on the job. If you feel comfortable, share examples of how you have used them in your professional career.

    * Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

        * ☝ This week, we're learning React, which you've likely already heard of throughout the boot camp from time to time. Is anyone familiar with any other web frameworks or libraries?

        * 🙋 Yes! Angular and Vue are two other popular frameworks/libraries.

        * ☝ Right. So why do we teach React?

        * 🙋 React is currently the most popular framework on the market, with rising demand every year.

        * ☝ And when you're looking for jobs, should you also apply to positions that want Angular and Vue developers even though we don't teach them in this course?

        * 🙋 Yes, because the skills are directly transferrable among frameworks! The frameworks are all fairly similar with just a few key differences among them.

    **How to Succeed This Week**: Remind students that they might experience moments of frustration as they learn complex concepts and tools, and that these times are actually proven opportunities to deepen knowledge. Consider sharing something about your personal learning journey. This helps students recognize that everyone starts somewhere and that they are not alone.

    **Today's Objectives**: Outline the concepts that will be covered in today's lesson. Remind students that they can find the relevant activity files in the "Getting Ready for Class" page in their course content.

### 2. Instructor Do: Student Check-In (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

    * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back at what we accomplished and acknowledge that it's a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed&mdash;as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic? 

    * 🙋 Let's do Fist to Five together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 3. Instructor Demo: Component Map (5 min) 

* Open `01-Component-Map/Solved` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 Today we will be using the provided [00-React-App](../../01-Class-Content/20-React/01-Activities/00-React-App) React app for all of our activities this week.

    * 🔑 First, we need to copy the [src](../../01-Class-Content/20-React/01-Activities/01-Component-Map/Solved/src) folder and paste it into the [00-React-App/](../00-React-App/) app. 

    * 🔑 Then we navigate to [00-React-App](../../01-Class-Content/20-React/01-Activities/00-React-App) and start the app in dev mode by running `npm start` from the command line.

    * 🔑 This will automatically open the browser to <http://localhost:3000>. 
    
    * 🔑 We will see a list of grocery items rendered on the page.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used this in Lesson 1 when we mapped over the categories and listed them on the page.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

    * 🙋 We will need to know how to map over an array of objects and display them on the page, like the projects for the portfolio.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We will map over the groceries and render a `<li>` tag for each item in order to display them on the page.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Component Map (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-Component-Map/README.md`, which are also shown here:

     ```md
     # Component Map

     In this activity, you will map over a list of groceries and render each item in an unordered list on the page.

     ## Instructions

     * **Note** You will be using the same React application, [00-React-App](../00-React-App), for all of our activities today.

     * Copy the [src](Unsolved/src) folder and paste it into the [00-React-App/](../00-React-App/) app. 

     * Navigate to [01-Activities/00-React-App](../00-React-App) and start the app in dev mode by running `npm start` from your command line.

     * Check out the application running on <http://localhost:3000> in your browser. Right now, we don't see any of the grocery items on the page.

     * Open [App.js](../00-React-App/src/App.js) and notice the array of groceries. It is passed into the `List` component.

     * Open [List.js](../00-React-App/src/components/List.js) and do the following:

         * Inside of the `<ul>` tags, `.map` over the groceries that were passed through props.

         * Render a `<li>` tag for each item and display the `name` property of each item.

     * Check the application in your browser to see all of the groceries listed.

     * Press `CTRL + C` to stop the server before moving on to the next activity.

     ## Hint(s)

     * You can refer to the React Docs on [Lists and Keys](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/lists-and-keys.html) and the MDN Web Docs on [Array.prototype.map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map).

     ## Bonus

     * For styling purposes, give each `<li>` tag a `className` of `list-group-item`.
     ```

### 5. Instructor Review: Component Map (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points (:key:) below to review the following key points (✔️):

    * ✔️ `.map()`

    * ✔️ `<li>`

* Open `01-Component-Map/Solved/src/components/List.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * First, we notice how the array of grocery objects is passed into the `List` component from inside `App`, making it available inside the `List` component as `props.groceries`.

         ```js
         function List(props) {
         ```

    * 🔑 Inside the `List` component, we insert JSX curly braces inside the `<ul>` element. We map over `props.groceries` and return one `<li>` tag for every item in `props.groceries`.

         ```js
         <ul className="list-group">
           {props.groceries.map(item => (
             <li className="list-group-item" key={item.id}>
         ```

    * 🔑 It is important to note that we need to include the `key` property attached to the `<li>` tag.

         ```js
         <li className="list-group-item" key={item.id}>
         ```

    * Finally, we render the `item.name` on the page.

         ```js
         {item.name}
         ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What type of value is returned by the map method here?

    * 🙋 The `.map()` method will always return an array&mdash;in our case, it is returning an array of JSX elements.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 1, read the [React Docs on Lists and Keys](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/lists-and-keys.html), and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: useState Counter (5 min) 

* Open `02-useState-Counter/Solved` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 Again, we will need to copy the [src](../../01-Class-Content/20-React/01-Activities/02-useState-Counter/Solved/src) folder and replace the `src` folder in the [00-React-App/](../00-React-App/) app with this one.

    * 🔑 Then we navigate to [00-React-App](../../01-Class-Content/20-React/01-Activities/00-React-App) and start the app in dev mode by running `npm start` from the command line.

    * 🔑 This will automatically open the browser to <http://localhost:3000>.

    * 🔑 There is a counter, and we can increment or decrement the value by clicking the buttons.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used React Hooks in Lesson 3. We used `useState` to manage the categories.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

    * 🙋 We will be using React Hooks in the Challenge to manage state within a component.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We need to use `useState` in order to declare a new state variable and then add a click handler to the two buttons so that when they are clicked, it will change the state.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: useState Counter (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-useState-Counter/README.md`, which are also shown here:

     ```md
     # useState Counter

     In this activity, you will use the `useState` Hook to declare a state variable and update it by incrementing or decrementing using click handlers on buttons. 

     ## Instructions

     * **Note** You will be using the same React application, [00-React-App](../00-React-App), for all of our activities today. Stop the server if it is still running.

     * Copy the [src](Unsolved/src) folder and swap out the previous `src` folder in the [00-React-App/](../00-React-App/) app with this one.

     * Navigate to [01-Activities/00-React-App](../00-React-App) and start the app in dev mode by running `npm start` from your command line.

     * Check out the application running on <http://localhost:3000> in your browser. We see two buttons but nothing happens when we click them. Also the "Click Count" is blank.

     * Open [Counter.js](../00-React-App/src/components/Counter.js) and implement the following:

         * Import `useState` Hook from React.

         * Inside the `Counter` component, using `useState`, declare a new state variable `count` and initialize it to zero by passing `0` as the `useState` argument. Name the returned setter method `setCount`.

         * Show the current `count` value.

         * Add a click handler to the two buttons so that when the buttons are clicked, `setCount` is called and `count` is assigned a new incremented or decremented value respectively.

     * Check the application in your browser to see if the counter works properly.

     * Press `CTRL + C` to stop the server.

     ## Hint(s)

     * You can refer to the React Docs on [Using the State Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html).
     ```

### 8. Instructor Review: useState Counter (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points (:key:) below to review the following key points (✔️):

    * ✔️ `useState`

    * ✔️ `{count}`

    * ✔️ `onClick`

* Open `02-useState-Counter/Solved/src/components/Counter.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * First, we need to import `useState` from React.

         ```js
         import React, { useState } from 'react';
         ```

    * 🔑 Next we declare a new state variable called `count` and initialize it to zero. We name the setter method `setCount`. We will use this later to change the state.

         ```js
         const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
         ```

    * 🔑 On the page, we need to render the current count.

         ```js
         <p className="card-text">Click Count: {count}</p>
         ```

    * 🔑 Then, on the buttons, we add a click handler to call `setCount` and change the `count` value by 1, whether that's through adding or subtracting.

         ```js
         <button className="btn btn-primary" onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
           Increment
         </button>{' '}
         <button className="btn btn-danger" onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>
           Decrement
         </button>
         ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What exactly are Hooks?

    * 🙋 Hooks are just JavaScript functions that follow two rules:

        1. Only call Hooks from React functions

        2. Only call Hooks at the top level

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 3, read the [React Docs on Using the State Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html), and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding.

### 9. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

    * 🙋 We learned how to use the `.map()` method in order to render JSX from an array of objects. We also learned about React Hooks, mainly `useState`.

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful. 

    * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

    * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the Challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer. 

    * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

    * 🙋 Mapping to render JSX is covered in Lesson 1, and React Hooks are covered in Lesson 3. 

    * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Use student answers to transition to Office Hours.

### 10. Challenge Review (30 min)

* Take this time to help get students unblocked on the current Challenge that they are working through.

* Expect that students may ask for the following:

  * Further review on a particular subject

  * Debugging assistance

  * Help with computer issues

  * Guidance with a particular tool
