# Module 20 Virtual Class: React

## Overview

In today's virtual class, students will practice using React Hooks, conditional rendering, and forms.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Explain the `useEffect` Hook and how it can be used inside a React app.

* Build dynamic components that conditionally render based on the state of their app.

* Create functional forms in React.

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* **Important**: In order to avoid continuous NPM installs, all of today's activities' Solved and Unsolved folders include only a `src` folder. Swap out the `src` folder for each activity in `00-practice-app`. It's recommended that you completely restart the dev server between activities.

* To avoid errors due to conflicting versions of ESLint in the repo, navigate to `00-practice-app` in the command line and run the following command:

  ```sh
  echo "SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true" > .env
  ```

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms and check if the group is having any problems using `00-practice-app` for their activities.

* React Hooks and conditional rendering were all covered in Lesson 3. React forms was covered in Lesson 4.

## Office Hours

Encourage students to work on the remaining module algorithms during Office Hours. Review the algorithm solutions 5–10 minutes before class begins or during Office Hours after class.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What did you learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

  * 🙋 We learned about React! We learned about JSX basics, functional components, props, hooks, state, and more! We are moving fast compared to traditional learners. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

  * ☝️ Did anyone have an "Aha!" or "Eureka!" moment this week? When was it and why did things suddenly click for you?

  * 🙋 Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we're thinking about it.

  * ☝️ Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

  * 🙋 It's easy to get stuck when you're learning web development. It's important to learn how to get unstuck because it happens to the pros too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the tool's official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups are great because explaining your problems to someone else often reveals the solution.

### 2. Review Current Challenge (5 min)

* Navigate to `01-Class-Content/20-React/02-Challenge/Main` from the command line and run `npm start`.

  * We are creating our own portfolio using our new React skills!

  * We have a "About Me", "Portfolio", "Contact", and "Resume" page.

  * The header includes a navigation bar and the footer includes icon links to various third platform profiles.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What recently acquired skills will help us build this challenge?

  * 🙋 This challenge is all about React! You will need to use JSX, React Hooks, functional components, and conditional rendering to make this.

  * ☝️ How are these skills relevant to a career in web development?

  * 🙋 Ever since React was released in 2013, it was quickly adopted by companies large and small and continues to gain in popularity as the library matures. Users now demand increased interactivity and speed in a web application. As the complexity of an application grows, so too does the number of DOM manipulations required to render content, thus resulting in a slower user-experience. React addresses this performance issue using the concept of a virtual DOM.

  * ☝️ How will this challenge improve your portfolio?

  * 🙋 It will demonstrate your ability to use React to create a high-quality, professional portfolio.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 3. Instructor Demo: Hooks useEffect (5 min)

* Open `03-Hooks-useEffect/Solved` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 Again, today we will be using the `00-practice-app` React app from the last class for all of our activities. Delete the `src` folder in the `00-practice-app`.

  * 🔑 We need to copy the [src](../../01-Class-Content/20-React/01-Activities/03-Hooks-useEffect/Solved/src) folder from this activity and paste it into the `00-practice-app` app.

  * 🔑 Then, we navigate to `00-practice-app` and start the app in dev mode by running `npm start` from the command line.

  * 🔑 This will automatically open the browser to <http://localhost:3000>.

  * 🔑 We see the current temperature on the browser tab. When we raise or lower the temperature, it is reflected immediately on the browser tab.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We used `useEffect` to update the browser tab in Lesson 3.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  * 🙋 We will be using React Hooks in the challenge to change the DOM.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We will use `useEffect` to set the `document.title` to the current temperature.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Hooks useEffect  (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `03-Hooks-useEffect/README.md`.

  ```md
  # 📖 Implement the useEffect Hook

  ## Before We Begin

  Before you begin this activity, complete the following steps:

  1. Delete the `/src` folder in [00-practice-app](../00-practice-app/).

  2. Copy the `/src` folder from [Unsolved](./Unsolved/) and paste it into [00-practice-app](../00-practice-app/).

  ## Activity

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to be able to use the `useEffect` Hook to update the browser tab to reflect the current temperature.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when I have imported `useEffect` into `Thermostat.js`.

  * It's done when I have set a value for the `temp` variable.

  * It's done when I have used the `useEffect` Hook to set the `document.title` to the current temperature.

  ## 📝 Notes

  Refer to the documentation:

  [React Docs on the Effect Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html)

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What are some other use cases for the `useEffect()` Hook?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 5. Instructor Review: Hooks useEffect  (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with the `useEffect` Hook? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help.

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ React Hooks

  * ✔️ Optional dependency array

* Open `03-Hooks-useEffect/Solved/src/components/Thermostat.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * This application updates the `document.title` every time the user clicks one of the buttons to raise or lower the temperature.

  * This is accomplished by using the `useEffect` Hook, which we imported with React:

    ```js
    import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
    ```

  * We start by creating a `temp` variable and `setTemp` as a function to update it. We also set an initial value of `75`:

    ```js
    const [temp, setTemp] = useState(75);
    ```

  * Next, we create a `useEffect` Hook that will update the `document.title` as a side effect whenever the state is changed:

    ```js
    useEffect(() => {
      document.title = `${temp}° Fahrenheit`;
    });
    ```

  * Finally, we have the render method that returns the JSX we see on the page. It contains two button elements that have the inline `onClick` attribute set to `increaseTemp` or `decreaseTemp`:

    ```jsx
    <button
      type="button"
      className="btn btn-danger"
      onClick={increaseTemp}
    >
      Raise temperature
    </button>{' '}
    <button
      type="button"
      className="btn btn-primary"
      onClick={decreaseTemp}
    >
    ```

  * Both of the click handlers are responsible for updating the state of the temp variable:

    ```js
    const increaseTemp = () => {
      setTemp(temp + 1);
    };

    const decreaseTemp = () => {
      setTemp(temp - 1);
    };
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What would happen if we provided an empty array as the second argument to the `useEffect` Hook?

  * 🙋 The `document.title` would only update one time.

  * ☝️ When does `useEffect` run?

  * 🙋 The function passed to `useEffect` will run after the render is committed to the screen. By default, effects run after every completed render, but you can choose to fire them only when certain values have changed.

  * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 3, read the [React Docs on Using the Effect Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Conditional Rendering (5 min)

* Open `04-Conditional-Rendering/Solved` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 Be sure to stop the server if it is still running.

  * 🔑 Again, we will need to copy the [src](../../01-Class-Content/20-React/01-Activities/04-Conditional-Rendering/Solved/src) folder and replace the `src` folder in the `00-practice-app` app with this one.

  * 🔑 Then, we navigate to `00-practice-app` and start the app in dev mode by running `npm start` from the command line.

  * 🔑 This will automatically open the browser to <http://localhost:3000>.

  * 🔑 We see a navbar on top, and when we click on a tab, the corresponding page is rendered under the navbar.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We conditionally rendered the gallery pages in Lesson 3.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  * 🙋 The challenge will require us to conditionally render different components of our portfolio.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We need to use a ternary operator to check which page needs to be rendered depending on the state of the `currentPage`.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Conditional Render  (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Conditional-Rendering/README.md`.

  ```md
  # 📐 Add Comments to Implementation of Conditional Rendering

  ## Before We Begin

  Before you begin this activity, complete the following steps:

  1. Delete the `/src` folder in [00-practice-app](../00-practice-app/).

  2. Copy the `/src` folder from [Unsolved](./Unsolved/) and paste it into [00-practice-app](../00-practice-app/).

  3. This project uses Bootstrap, so don't forget to import it inside `index.js`:

    `import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'`

  ## Activity

  Work with a partner to add comments that describe the functionality of the code found in the [PortfolioContainer](../00-practice-app/src/components/PortfolioContainer.js) and [NavTabs](../00-practice-app/src/components/NavTabs.js) components.

  ## 📝 Notes

  Refer to the documentation:

  * [React Docs on conditional rendering](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html)

  ---

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * Can you think of some scenarios where conditional rendering would be beneficial?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 8. Instructor Review: Conditional Render (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ Ternary operators

  * ✔️ Object destructuring

* Open `04-Conditional-Rendering/Solved/src/components/PortfolioContainer.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * This component, `PortfolioContainer`, imports a few other components that will be used in the return method.

  * Also, because we will use the `useState` Hook, we import it using React:

    ```js
    import React, { useState } from 'react';
    import NavTabs from './NavTabs';
    import Home from './pages/Home';
    import About from './pages/About';
    import Blog from './pages/Blog';
    import Contact from './pages/Contact';
    ```

  * We declare a state variable called `currentPage` that has an initial value of `Home`. We also provide a state management method as the second item in the array, called `setCurrentPage()`:

    ```js
    const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState('Home');
    ```

  * The `renderPage()` method returns a component based on the value of `currentPage`:

    ```js
    const renderPage = () => {
      if (currentPage === 'Home') {
        return <Home />;
      }
      if (currentPage === 'About') {
        return <About />;
      }
      if (currentPage === 'Blog') {
        return <Blog />;
      }
      return <Contact />;
    };
    ```

  * We update the value of `currentPage` by passing an event handler `handlePageChange()` to the `NavTabs` component. This method accepts one argument (the current page) and then invokes the `setCurrentPage()` method:

    ```js
    const handlePageChange = (page) => setCurrentPage(page);
    ```

  * In the return method, we return the `NavTabs` component while passing `currentPage` and `handlePageChange()` as props. This will allow us to pass down the state variable and a function to update it to the child component:

    ```js
    return (
      <div>
        <NavTabs currentPage={currentPage} handlePageChange={handlePageChange} />
        {renderPage()}
      </div>
    );
    ```

* Open `04-Conditional-Rendering/Solved/src/components/NavTabs.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 In the `NavTabs` component, first we use object destructuring to assign `currentPage` and `handleCurrentPage` to their own variable names:

    ```js
    function NavTabs({ currentPage, handlePageChange }) { ... }
    ```

  * In the `return()` method, we are rendering an ordered list and changing the style based on what the current tab is. To do this, we created a ternary statement inside the class attribute.

  * Remember that because we imported Bootstrap into this project, those `className` attributes reference classes that Bootstrap has created for us. We are simply referencing them:

    ```js
    return (
      <ul className="nav nav-tabs">
        <li className="nav-item">
          <a
            href="#home"
            onClick={() => handlePageChange('Home')}
            className={currentPage === 'Home' ? 'nav-link active' : 'nav-link'}
          >
            Home
          </a>
        </li>
        ...
    )
    ```

  * First, we check whether the `currentPage` is strictly equal to a string, `Home`. If it is, we set the `className` to `nav-link active`. Otherwise, we set it to `nav-link`.

  * 🔑 `nav-link active` is a Bootstrap class and the reason that the selected tab appears with a blue outline.

  * We repeat this logic for every item in the unordered list.

    ```jsx
    className={currentPage === 'Home' ? 'nav-link active' : 'nav-link'}
    ```

* Open `04-Conditional-Rendering/Solved/src/components/pages/Home.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * Each of these components found in `components/pages` returns some static JSX.

  * Notice that they do not accept props or perform any sort of conditional rendering logic; they are simply there to return some JSX. This is by design so that we can keep the state and methods contained inside the parent components:

    ```js
    import React from 'react';

    function Home() {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Home Page</h1>
          <p>
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.Sed neque velit,
            lobortis ut magna varius, blandit rhoncus sem.Morbi lacinia nisi ac du
            fermentum, sed luctus urna tincidunt.Etiam ut feugiat ex.Cras non risu
            mi.Curabitur mattis rutrum ipsum, ut aliquet urna imperdiet ac.Sed ne
            nulla aliquam, bibendum odio eget, vestibulum tortor.Cras rutrum ligu in
            tincidunt commodo.Morbi sit amet mollis orci, in tristique ex.Don nec
            ornare elit.Donec blandit est sed risus feugiat porttitor.Vestibul
            molestie hendrerit massa non consequat.Vestibulum vitae lorem tortor.
            elementum ultricies tempus.Interdum et malesuada fames ac ante ipsum
            primis in faucibus.
          </p>
        </div>
      );
    }

    export default Home;
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What is another way we could've conditionally rendered the pages without a ternary operator?

  * 🙋 We could've used an `if/else` statement.

  * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 3, read the [React Docs on Conditional Rendering](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/conditional-rendering.html), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Instructor Demo: React Form  (5 min)

* Open `05-React-Forms/Solved` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 Be sure to stop the server if it is still running.

  * 🔑 Again, we will need to copy the [src](../../01-Class-Content/20-React/01-Activities/05-Friends-List/Solved/src) folder and replace the `src` folder in the `00-practice-app` app with this one.

  * 🔑 Then, we navigate to `00-practice-app` and start the app in dev mode by running `npm start` from the command line.

  * 🔑 This will automatically open the browser to <http://localhost:3000>.

  * 🔑 We see a React form with front-end validation.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We created a "Contact me" form in Lesson 4.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  * 🙋 We will need to add a form to our portfolio page.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We will need to implement form validation.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 10. Student Do: React Forms (20 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `05-React-Forms/README.md`.

  ```md
  # 🏗️ Implement Functionality for the Forms Section

  ## Before We Begin

  Before you begin this activity, complete the following steps:

  1. Delete the `/src` folder in [00-practice-app](../00-practice-app/).

  2. Copy the `/src` folder from [Unsolved](./Unsolved/) and paste it into [00-practice-app](../00-practice-app/).

  ## Activity

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to prevent empty input for the email and username fields of a form.

  * As a developer, I want to improve the user experience by automatically clearing the input fields after the user clicks submit.

  * As a developer, I want to make the application more robust by adding a password input field.

  * As a developer, I want to ensure that the email and password provided by the user are valid.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  This activity is complete when the following criteria are met:

  * It's done when I have created a state variable, `password`.

  * It's done when I have added a condition to check if the input type is `password` and to update state using `setPassword`.

  * It's done when I have used the methods in the `helper.js` file to validate the format of the email and the strength of the password.

  * It's done when I have set the input fields back to empty strings after the user clicks submit.

  * It's done when I have added a new input field in the return statement with `name`, `type`, `placeholder`, `value`, and `onChange` attributes.

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * How could we have implemented basic form validation without using helper functions?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 11. Instructor Review: React Forms  (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `event.preventDefault()`

  * ✔️ Destructuring assignment syntax

* Open `05-React-Forms/Solved/src/components/Form/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * At the top of the `index.js` for the `Form` component, we need to import `useState` with React first. We are also importing some helper functions that will check the `password` and `email` for validity. These are located in the `/utils` folder:

    ```js
    import React, { useState } from 'react';
    import { checkPassword, validateEmail } from '../../utils/helpers';
    ```

  * If we open `index.js`, we can see that the `Form` component initializes some state variables by using the `useState` Hook. Each of them is set to empty strings to start:

    ```js
    function Form() {
      const [email, setEmail] = useState('');
      const [userName, setUserName] = useState('');
      const [password, setPassword] = useState('');
      const [errorMessage, setErrorMessage] = useState('');
    ```

  * If we look at the return method, we have another form, but this time we also have a `password` input. Notice how each input has a `value`, `name`, and `onChange` prop.

  * 🔑 When dealing with passwords, remember to set the input type to `password` instead of `text`, which tells the browser to hide the user's input as they type it:

    ```js
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Hello {userName}</p>
        <form className="form">
          <input
            value={email}
            name="email"
          onChange={handleInputChange}
            type="email"
            placeholder="email"
          />
          <input
            value={userName}
            name="userName"
            onChange={handleInputChange}
            type="text"
            placeholder="username"
          />
          <input
            value={password}
            name="password"
            onChange={handleInputChange}
            type="password"
            placeholder="Password"
          />
          <button type="button" onClick={handleFormSubmit}>Submit</button>
        </form>
        ...
      </div>
    );
    ```

  * The `onChange` attribute for each of these input fields is responsible for calling the `handleInputChange()` whenever the user enters anything.

  * First we check the `name` attribute of each element and, depending on its value, update the corresponding state variable:

    ```js
    const handleInputChange = (e) => {
      const { target } = e;
      const inputType = target.name;
      const inputValue = target.value;

      if (inputType === 'email') {
        setEmail(inputValue);
      } else if (inputType === 'userName') {
        setUserName(inputValue);
      } else {
        setPassword(inputValue);
      }
    };
    ```

  * When it comes time for the user to actually submit the form, we have an event for that. It is attached to the `onSubmit` attribute of the form, which then calls `handleFormSubmit()`.

  * In the logic, we check whether the `email` is invalid or `userName` is empty. If so, we set an error message and return out of the code block.

  * We do the same with the password. If `password` is not valid, set an error message and return out of the code block.

  * In the event that everything checks out, we send an alert to the user and set the state variables back to empty strings:

    ```js
    const handleFormSubmit = (e) => {
      e.preventDefault();

      if (!validateEmail(email) || !userName) {
        setErrorMessage('Email or username is invalid');
        return;
      }
      if (!checkPassword(password)) {
        setErrorMessage(
          `Choose a more secure password for the account: ${userName}`
        );
        return;
      }
      alert(`Hello ${userName}`);

      setUserName('');
      setPassword('');
      setEmail('');
    };
    ```

  * State is updated when we enter any character into the first name and last name inputs, due to the `handleInputChange()` method. As a result, the page updates in real time when we type:

    ```jsx
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Hello {userName}</p>
      ...
      </div>
    )
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why do we use `event.preventDefault()` in the function to handle the form submission?

  * 🙋 With single-page apps and React, we don't want the page to refresh when the user clicks submit.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [React Docs on forms](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 12. Recap & Promote Additional Resources (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What do you think you absolutely need to know to succeed at the challenge?

  * 🙋 You need to understand the fundamentals of React: JSX, props, state, hooks, and functional components.

  * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

  * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it is not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful.

  * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material prior to class as possible?

  * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

* Direct students to the additional resources available to them:

  * Reflection and Retrieval

  * Career Connection

  * Dessert Menu

### 13. Introduce Upcoming Challenge (5 min)

* Navigate to `01-Class-Content/21-MERN/02-Challenge/Main` from the command line and run `npm start`.

  * In this challenge, we are taking an existing book search engine and adding the ability to pull book data from the Google Books API on the front end, and allow users to save book searches to the back end.

  * The app is built using the MERN stack! It has a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.

  * However, this app utilizes GraphQL as an alternative to RESTful API patterns.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are we learning?

  * 🙋 We are learning GraphQL next week! We will use the fetch API on the front end to pull book data from the Google Books API. We will also use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data. We will utilize JSON Web Tokens to add authentication.

  * ☝️ How does this project build off or extend previously learned material?

  * 🙋 We are using MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js - the MERN stack!

  * ☝️ How does this project relate to your career goals?

  * 🙋 By using GraphQL, we're showing employers our knowledge and skill in a new API tool that's recently gained a lot of attention in web development. This gives us the opportunity to review and expand upon previously learned topics such as Mongoose and React, but also learn new tools and concepts to make us more well-versed as developers.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.
