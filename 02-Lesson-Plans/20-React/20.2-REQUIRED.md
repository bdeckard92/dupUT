# Module 20 Virtual Class (Required): React

## Overview 

In today's required virtual class, students will practice using React Hooks and conditional rendering. 


## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* use the `useEffect` and `useState` Hooks 

* use the `switch` statement to conditionally render different pages

* Map and filter through arrays to render different pages


## Instructor Notes 

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have. 

* **Important**: In order to avoid continuous NPM installs, all of today's activities' Solved and Unsolved folders include only a `src` folder. Use the given React app `00-react-app` and swap out the `src` folder for each activity. It's recommended that you completely restart the dev server between activities.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms and check if the group is having any problems using `00-react-app` for their activities.

* React Hooks and conditional rendering were all covered in Lesson 3.


## Office Hours

Encourage students to work on the remaining module algorithms during Office Hours. Review the algorithm solutions 5–10 minutes before class begins or during Office Hours after class.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What did you learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

    * 🙋 We learned about React! We learned about JSX basics, functional components, props, hooks, state, and more! We are moving fast compared to traditional learners. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ Did anyone have an "Aha!" or "Eureka!" moment this week? When was it and why did things suddenly click for you? 

    * 🙋 Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we're thinking about it.

    * ☝️ Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

    * 🙋 It's easy to get stuck when you're learning web development. It's important to learn how to get unstuck because it happens to the pros too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the tool's official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups are great because explaining your problems to someone else often reveals the solution. 


### 2. Review Current Challenge (5 min)

* Navigate to `01-Class-Content/20-React/02-Challenge/Master` from the command line and run `npm start`.

    * We are creating our own portfolio using our new React skills!

    * We have a "About Me", "Portfolio", "Contact", and "Resume" page.

    * The header includes a navigation bar and the footer includes icon links to various third platform profiles.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What recently acquired skills will help us build this challenge?

    * 🙋 This challenge is all about React! You will need to use JSX, React Hooks, functional components, and conditional rendering to make this.

    * ☝️ How are these skills relevant to a career in web development?

    * 🙋 Ever since React was released in 2013, it was quickly adopted by companies large and small and continues to gain in popularity as the library matures. Users now demand increased interactivity and speed in a web application. As the complexity of an application grows, so too does the number of DOM manipulations required to render content, thus resulting in a slower user-experience. React addresses this performance issue using the concept of a virtual DOM.

    * ☝️ How will this challenge improve your portfolio?

    * 🙋 It will demonstrate your ability to use React to create a high-quality, professional portfolio.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 3. Instructor Demo: useEffect Thermostat (5 min) 

* Open `03-useEffect-Thermostat/Solved` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 Today we will be using the provided [00-react-app](../../01-Class-Content/20-React/01-Activities/00-react-app) React app for all of our activities this week.

    * 🔑 First, we will need to copy the [src](../../01-Class-Content/20-React/01-Activities/03-useEffect-Thermostat/Solved/src) folder and paste it into the [00-react-app](../../01-Class-Content/20-React/01-Activities/00-react-app) app. 

    * 🔑 Then, we navigate to [00-react-app](../../01-Class-Content/20-React/01-Activities/00-react-app) and start the app in dev mode by running `npm start` from the command line.

    * 🔑 This will automatically open the browser to <http://localhost:3000>. 

    * 🔑 We see the current temperature on the browser tab. When we raise or lower the temperature, it is reflected immediately on the browser tab.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used `useEffect` to update the browser tab in Lesson 3.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We will be using React Hooks in the challenge to change the DOM.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We will use `useEffect` to set the `document.title` to the current temperature.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 4. Student Do: useEffect Thermostat  (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `03-useEffect-Thermostat/README.md`.

```md
# useEffect Thermostat

In this activity, you will use the `useEffect` Hook to update the browser tab to reflect the current temperature.

## Instructions

* **Note** You will be using the same React application, [00-react-app](../00-react-app), for all of our activities today.

* Copy the [src](Unsolved/src) folder and paste it into the [00-react-app](../00-react-app/) app. 

* Navigate to [01-Activities/00-react-app](../00-react-app) and start the app in dev mode by running `npm start` from your command line.

* Check out the application running on <http://localhost:3000> in your browser. The browser tab says "React App" but we want it to show our current temperature, which right now is set to 0.

* Open [Thermostat.js](../00-react-app/src/components/Thermostat.js) and do the following:

  * Import `useEffect` Hook from React.

  * Set the `temp` variable to any starting temperature of your choice.

  * Use the `useEffect` Hook to set the `document.title` to the current temperature.

* Check the application in your browser to see if the browser tab now reflects the current temperature. Raise and lower the temperature to see the browser tab automatically updated!

* Press `CTRL + C` to stop the server before moving on to the next activity.

## Hint(s)

* You can refer to the React Docs on [Using the Effect Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html).
```

### 5. Instructor Review: useEffect Thermostat  (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ `useEffect`

    * ✔️ `document.title`

* Open `03-useEffect-Thermostat/Solved/src/components/Thermostat.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * First, we need to import `useEffect` from React.

    ```js
    import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
    ```

    * Next, we change the initial value of `temp` to something more realistic, like 75 degrees.

    ```js
    const [temp, setTemp] = useState(75);
    ```

    * 🔑 Then, we use the `useEffect` Hook we imported by invoking the function. 

    ```js
    useEffect(() => {
        
    })
    ```

    * 🔑 Lastly, set the `document.title` to show the current `temp` value.

    ```js
    useEffect(() => {
        document.title = `${temp}° Fahrenheit`;
    })
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ When does `useEffect` run?

    * 🙋 The function passed to `useEffect` will run after the render is committed to the screen. By default, effects run after every completed render, but you can choose to fire them only when certain values have changed.

    * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 3, read the [React Docs on Using the Effect Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 6. Instructor Demo: Conditional Render (5 min) 

* Open `04-Conditional-Render/Solved` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 Be sure to stop the server if it is still running.

    * 🔑 Again, we will need to copy the [src](../../01-Class-Content/20-React/01-Activities/04-Conditional-Render/Solved/src) folder and replace the `src` folder in the [00-react-app](../../01-Class-Content/20-React/01-Activities/00-react-app) app with this one.

    * 🔑 Then, we navigate to [00-react-app](../../01-Class-Content/20-React/01-Activities/00-react-app) and start the app in dev mode by running `npm start` from the command line.

    * 🔑 This will automatically open the browser to <http://localhost:3000>.

    * 🔑 We see a navbar on top, and when we click on a tab, the corresponding page is rendered under the navbar.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We conditionally rendered the gallery pages in Lesson 3.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 The challenge will require us to conditionally render different components of our portfolio.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We need to use a `switch` statement to check which page needs to be rendered depending on the state of the `currentPage`.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 7. Student Do: Conditional Render  (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Conditional-Render/README.md`.

```md
# Conditional Render

In this activity, you will render one of four different components based upon the component's state using a `switch` statement.

## Instructions

* **Note** You will be using the same React application `00-react-app` for all of our activities today. Stop the server if it is still running.

* Copy the [src](Unsolved/src) folder and paste it into the [00-react-app](../00-react-app/) app. 

* Navigate to [01-Activities/00-react-app](../00-react-app) and start the app in dev mode by running `npm start` from your command line.

* Check out the application running on <http://localhost:3000> in your browser. At the top of the page, there's a Bootstrap NavTabs component. Whenever a nav element is clicked, the nav element goes into an "active" state. But nothing is rendered on the page.

* Open [NavTabs.js](../00-react-app/src/components/NavTabs.js) and observe the code.
  
  * We are mapping through the tabs and creating the `<li>` nav items for each tab.
  
  * Whenever a nav item is clicked, it sets the `currentPage` inside of the `PortfolioContainer` component to the selected tab through the `handlePageChange` method.

* Open [PortfolioContainer.js](../00-react-app/src/components/PortfolioContainer.js) and do the following:

  * Add a `switch` statement to `renderPage()` so that depending on the `currentPage`, a different component is returned in order to be rendered on the page.

    * Return the `About` component when `currentPage`is "About".
  
    * Return the `Blog` component when `currentPage` is "Blog".

    * Return the `Contact` component when `currentPage` is "Contact".

    * Return the `Home` component as default.

  * Under the `<NavTabs>`, render the component returned by `renderPage()`.

* Check the application in your browser to see if the page changes when you click the different nav items.

* Press `CTRL + C` to stop the server before moving on to the next activity.

### Hints

* You can refer to the React Docs on [Conditional Rendering](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/conditional-rendering.html) and MDN Web Docs on [switch statements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch).
```

### 8. Instructor Review: Conditional Render (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ `handlePageChange()`

    * ✔️ `switch` statement

    * ✔️ `renderPage()`

* Open `04-Conditional-Render/Solved/src/components/PortfolioContainer.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * We see a state variable called `currentPage` and the setter method called `handlePageChange`.

    ```js
    const [currentPage, handlePageChange] = useState('Home');
    ```

    * We see that those are passed as props to `NavTabs`.

    ```js
    <NavTabs currentPage={currentPage} handlePageChange={handlePageChange} />
    ```

* Open `04-Conditional-Render/Solved/src/components/NavTabs.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * We are mapping through the tabs and creating the `<li>` nav items for each tab.

    ```js
    {tabs.map(tab => (
      <li className="nav-item" key={tab}>
        <a
          href={'#' + tab.toLowerCase()}
          onClick={() => props.handlePageChange(tab)}    
          className={
            props.currentPage === tab ? 'nav-link active' : 'nav-link'
            }
        >
        {tab}
        </a>
      </li>
    ))}
    ```

    * 🔑 Whenever a nav item is clicked, it sets the `currentPage` inside of the `Portfolio` component to the selected tab through the `handlePageChange` method.

    ```js
    onClick={() => props.handlePageChange(tab)}
    ```

* Open `04-Conditional-Render/Solved/src/components/PortfolioContainer.js` in your IDE again and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 Back in the `Portfolio` component, we use a `switch` statement inside the `renderPage()` function to render the appropriate pages according to `currentPage`.

    ```js
    const renderPage = () => {
      switch (currentPage) {
        case 'About':
            return <About />;
        case 'Blog':
            return <Blog />;
        case 'Contact':
            return <Contact />;
        default:
            return <Home />;
      }
    };
    ```
    
    * 🔑 Finally, we will call the `renderPage()` function under `<NavTabs>` to render the `currentPage` on the screen.

    ```js
    <div>{renderPage(currentPage)}</div>
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What is another way we could've conditionally rendered the pages without using the `switch` statement?

    * 🙋 We could've used an `if/else` statement.

    * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 3, read the [React Docs on Conditional Rendering](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/conditional-rendering.html), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 9. Instructor Demo: Friends List  (5 min) 

* Open `05-Friends-List/Solved` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 Be sure to stop the server if it is still running.

    * 🔑 Again, we will need to copy the [src](../../01-Class-Content/20-React/01-Activities/05-Friends-List/Solved/src) folder and replace the `src` folder in the [00-react-app](../../01-Class-Content/20-React/01-Activities/00-react-app) app with this one.

    * 🔑 Then, we navigate to [00-react-app](../../01-Class-Content/20-React/01-Activities/00-react-app) and start the app in dev mode by running `npm start` from the command line.

    * 🔑 This will automatically open the browser to <http://localhost:3000>.

    * 🔑 We see many cards of cartoon friends on the page. If we click the red X on the card, it is removed from the page.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used the `.filter()` method to filter through the photos according to the category for the Gallery page in Lesson 3.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We will need to `map` and `filter` through arrays to render the items onto the page of our portfolios.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We need to use the `.filter()` method to filter out the `FriendCard` that needs to be removed from the page. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 10. Student Do: Friends List (20 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `05-Friends-List/README.md`.

```md
# Friends List

In this activity, you will map through `friendsList` and render a `FriendCard` component for each friend. You will also add functionality to remove a `FriendCard` from the page.

## Instructions

* **Note** You will be using the same React application `00-react-app` for all of our activities today. Stop the server if it is still running.

* Copy the [src](Unsolved/src) folder and paste it into the [00-react-app](../00-react-app/) app.

* Navigate to [01-Activities/00-react-app](../00-react-app) and start the app in dev mode by running `npm start` from your command line.

* Check out the application running on <http://localhost:3000> in your browser. None of the `FriendCard`s are rendered on the page.

* Open [App.js](../00-react-app/src/App.js) and do the following:
  
  * Import the `useState` Hook from React. 
  
  * Using `useState`, declare a new state variable `friendsList` and set the initial value to the imported `friends` array from `friends.json`. Name the returned setter method `setFriendsList`.

  * Create a method `removeFriend()` that accepts an `id` parameter and then utilizes the `.filter()` method to create a new array of friends without the passed `id`. Update the state with this new filtered array.

  * Map through `friendsList` to render a `FriendCard` for each friend. Remember to pass the `removeFriend()` method into each `FriendCard` along with each property of a `friend`.

* Keep checking the application in your browser as you make the changes. You should be able to see all of the `FriendCard`s rendered on the page and when you click the red X icon, that `FriendCard` should be removed from the page.

* Press `CTRL + C` to stop the server.

## Hint(s)

* Check `friends.json` for the properties of `friend` to pass into `FriendCard`.

* You can refer to the React Docs on [Using the State Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html), [Lists and Keys](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html), and the [MDN Web Docs on filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter).
```


### 11. Instructor Review: Friends List  (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ `useState`

    * ✔️ `removeFriend()`

    * ✔️ `.filter()`

    * ✔️ `.map()`

* Open `05-Friends-List/Solved/src/App.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * First, we need to import `useState` Hook from React.

    ```js
    import React, { useState } from 'react';
    ```

    * 🔑 Then we declare a new state variable `friendsList` and set the initial value to the imported `friends` array. We name the setter method `setFriendsList`.

    ```js
    const [friendsList, setFriendsList] = useState(friends);
    ```

    * 🔑 Next, we create a method called `removeFriend` that takes in an `id` of the `FriendCard` we want to remove.

    ```js
    const removeFriend = id => {
        
    };
    ```

    * 🔑 We use the `.filter()` method to create a new array. Then we set the `friendsList` to this new array using the `setFriendsList` setter method.

    ```js
    const newList = friendsList.filter(friend => friend.id !== id);
    setFriendsList(newList);
    ```

    * 🔑 Finally, we map through the `friendsList` to render a `FriendCard` component for each friend. We pass in the `removeFriend()` method, as well as the properties of a `friend` to each one.

    ```js
    {friendsList.map(friend => (
        <FriendCard
          removeFriend={removeFriend}
          id={friend.id}
          key={friend.id}
          name={friend.name}
          image={friend.image}
          occupation={friend.occupation}
          location={friend.location}
        />
    ))}
    ```

* Open `05-Friends-List/Solved/src/components/FriendCard/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * If we look at the `FriendCard` component, we see how the `onClick` handler is attached to the `<span>`. When clicked, it calls the `removeFriend` method and passes in `props.id`.

    ```js
    <span onClick={() => props.removeFriend(props.id)} className="remove">
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Why do we have the `removeFriend` handler wrapped inside of another function?

    * 🙋 Since our event handlers need to be callbacks, we normally can't pass in arguments without invoking them right away. But by wrapping the `removeFriend` method in an another function, we can pass the `id` prop into the inner `removeFriend` method. When the `span` is clicked, it calls the anonymous callback function, which then calls the `removeFriend` method with the friend's `id` as an argument.

    * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 3, read the [MDN Web Docs on filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 12. Recap & Promote Additional Resources (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What do you think you absolutely need to know to succeed at the challenge?

    * 🙋 You need to understand the fundamentals of React: JSX, props, state, hooks, and functional components.

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it is not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful. 

    * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material prior to class as possible?

    * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

* Direct students to the additional resources available to them:

    * Reflection and Retrieval

    * Career Connection

    * Dessert Menu

### 13. Introduce Upcoming Challenge (5 min)

* Navigate to `01-Class-Content/21-MERN/02-Challenge/Master` from the command line and run `npm start`.

    * In this challenge, we are taking an existing book search engine and adding the ability to pull book data from the Google Books API on the front end, and allow users to save book searches to the back end. 

    * The app is built using the MERN stack! It has a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.

    * However, this app utilizes GraphQL as an alternative to RESTful API patterns.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What are we learning?

    * 🙋 We are learning GraphQL next week! We will use the fetch API on the front end to pull book data from the Google Books API. We will also use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data. We will utilize JSON Web Tokens to add authentication. 

    * ☝️ How does this project build off or extend previously learned material?

    * 🙋 We are using MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js - the MERN stack!

    * ☝️ How does this project relate to your career goals?

    * 🙋 By using GraphQL, we're showing employers our knowledge and skill in a new API tool that's recently gained a lot of attention in web development. This gives us the opportunity to review and expand upon previously learned topics such as Mongoose and React, but also learn new tools and concepts to make us more well-versed as developers.
