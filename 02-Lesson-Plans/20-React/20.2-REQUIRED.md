# Module 20 Virtual Class (Required): React

## Overview 

In today's required virtual class, students will practice using React Hooks and conditional rendering. 


## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* use the `useEffect` Hook 

* use the `switch` statement to conditionally render different pages

* use the `useState` Hook

* Map and filter through arrays to render different pages


## Instructor Notes 

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have. 

* **Important**: In order to avoid continuous NPM installs, all of today's activities' Solved and Unsolved folders include only a `src` folder. Use the given React app `reactpractice` and swap out the `src` folder for each activity. It's recommended that you completely restart the dev server between activities.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms and check if the group is having any problems using `reactpractice` for their activities.

* React Hooks and conditional rendering were all covered in Lesson 3.


## Office Hours

Encourage students to work on the remaining module algorithms during Office Hours. Review the algorithm solutions 5–10 minutes before class begins or during Office Hours after class.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What did you learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

    * 🙋 We learned about React! We learned about JSX basics, functional components, props, hooks, state, and more! We are moving fast compared to traditional learners. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ Did anyone have an "Aha!" or "Eureka!" moment this week? When was it and why did things suddenly click for you? 

    * 🙋 Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we're thinking about it.

    * ☝️ Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

    * 🙋 It's easy to get stuck when you're learning web development. It's important to learn how to get unstuck because it happens to the pros too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the tool's official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups are great because explaining your problems to someone else often reveals the solution. 


### 2. Review Current Challenge (5 min)

* Navigate to `01-Class-Content/20-React/02-Challenge/Master` from the command line and run `npm start`.

    * We are creating our own portfolio using our new React skills!

    * We have a "About Me", "Portfolio", "Contact", and "Resume" page.

    * The header includes a navigation bar and the footer includes icon links to various third platform profiles.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What recently acquired skills will help us build this challenge?

    * 🙋 This challenge is all about React! You will need to use JSX, React Hooks, functional components, and conditional rendering to make this.

    * ☝️ How are these skills relevant to a career in web development?

    * 🙋 Ever since React was released in 2013, it was quickly adopted by companies large and small and continues to gain in popularity as the library matures. Users now demand increased interactivity and speed in a web application. As the complexity of an application grows, so too does the number of DOM manipulations required to render content, thus resulting in a slower user-experience. React addresses this performance issue using the concept of a virtual DOM.

    * ☝️ How will this challenge improve your portfolio?

    * 🙋 It will demonstrate your ability to use React to create a high-quality, professional portfolio.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 3. Instructor Demo: useEffect Thermostat (5 min) 

* Open `03-useEffect-Thermostat/Solved` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 Today we will be using the provided [reactpractice](../../01-Class-Content/20-React/01-Activities/reactpractice) React app for all of our activities this week.

    * 🔑 First, we will need to copy the [src](../../01-Class-Content/20-React/01-Activities/03-useEffect-Thermostat/Solved/src) folder and paste it into the [reactpractice/](../reactpractice/) app. 

    * 🔑 Then, we navigate to [reactpractice](../../01-Class-Content/20-React/01-Activities/reactpractice) and start the app in dev mode by running `npm start` from the command line.

    * 🔑 This will automatically open the browser to <http://localhost:3000>. 

    * 🔑 We see the current temperature on the browser tab. When we raise or lower the temperature, it is reflected immediately on the browser tab.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used `useEffect` to update the browser tab in Lesson 3.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We will be using React Hooks in the challenge to change the DOM.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We will use `useEffect` to set the `document.title` to the current temperature.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.
