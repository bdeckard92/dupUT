# Module 20 Virtual Class (Recommended): React

## Overview 

In today's recommended virtual class, students will utilize the `.map()` method in order to render JSX from an array of objects. Students will also use the React `useState` Hook to use state variables in a functional component. Lastly, students will solve a new algorithm in CodeSignal.


## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* solve the CodeSignal algorithm `changeToOnes`

* map over an array and render the items on the page

* use the `useState` Hook to use state variables


## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have. 

* **Important**: In order to avoid continuous NPM installs, all of today's activities' Solved and Unsolved folders include only a `src` folder. Use the given React app `00-react-app` and swap out the `src` folder for each activity. It's recommended that you completely restart the dev server between activities.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms and check if the group is having any problems using `00-react-app` for their activities.

* Mapping and rendering JSX on to the page was covered in Lesson 1 and `useState` was covered in Lesson 3.

## Class Instructions 

### 1. Introduction (5 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Direct students to post individual questions in the Zoom chat to be addressed by TAs and/or at the end of class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

    * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back and see what we accomplished, and acknowledge that it's a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic? 

    * 🙋 Let's do "fist to five" together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).


### 2. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)


* [Click here for CodeSignal challenge](https://app.codesignal.com/public-test/jYHQ873GTw8sCwmDv/3LodRHTbsfXA6s) 

* Remind students that practicing algorithm-based interview questions is one of the best ways to prep for interviews because:

    * companies often use algorithm questions to test candidates knowledge, despite not using these kinds of algorithms every day

    * it is great practice to learn new JavaScript methods and to solidify knowledge

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Did anyone attempt the Code Signal algorithm?

    * 🙋 It is encouraged to take advantage of the CodeSignal practice because it reflects real-world online interviewing.

* Open your IDE and review the solution to the CodeSignal algorithm:

    * The algorithm is called `changeToOnes`. We are given an input string, `s` and we are asked to replace each digit to the corresponding number of ones (1s).

    * For `s = "abc5bc3"`, the output should be `changeToOnes(s) = "abc11111bc111"`.

    * The instructions provide the following details regarding input and output:

    ```md
    [execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)

    [input] string s

    The string consisting of Latin letters and digits.

    Guaranteed constraints:
    1 ≤ s.length ≤ 100.

    [output] string

    The input string with digits replaced to the corresponding number of ones.
    ```

    * We are also provided the following starter code:

    ```js
    function changeToOnes(s) {

    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝) and call on students for answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What is the first step to solve this problem?

    * 🙋 We will want a placeholder to hold the new string while we loop through the original string and replace any digits with ones.

    * ☝️ Right! So setting up the template of our answer might look something like this:

    ```js
    // empty string for the result
    let result = '';
    
    // set up the for loop
    for(let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {

        // our logic here

    }
    ```

    * ☝️ What did you do next?

    * 🙋 So inside the `for` loop, we need to check if each of the characters is a string digit between '0' and '9', and if it is, replace it with the corresponding number of ones.

    * ☝️ Yes, but how would we check whether the value is a digit?

    * 🙋 One way is to just use less than and greater than, with string digits, it'll still work:

    ```js
    if (s[i] >= '0' && s[i] <= '9') {
        // replace with the right number of ones
    }
    ```

     * ☝️ Perfect, so let's go ahead and change the digit to ones. This can be done with a simple for loop as long as we remember to `parseInt()` the string digit.

     ```js
    for (let j = 0; j < parseInt(s[i]); j++) {

        // here we are adding those 1s into the placeholder result variable
        result += '1';
    }
     ```

    * 🙋 And for those that are not digits, we can just concatenate them straight into the placeholder variable!

    * ☝️ Exactly, so our logic as a whole will look like this:

    ```js
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (s[i] >= '0' && s[i] <= '9') {
            for (let j = 0; j < parseInt(s[i]); j++) {
                result += '1';
            }
        } else {
            result += s[i];
        }
    }
    return result;
    ```

* Full solution:

```js
function changeToOnes(s) {
    let result = '';
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if ('0' <= s[i] && s[i] <= '9') {
            for (let j = 0; j < parseInt(s[i]); j++) {
                result += '1';
            }
        } else {
            result += s[i];
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

* Answer any remaining questions and move on to the next activity. 

### 3. Instructor Demo: Component Map (5 min) 

* Open `01-Component-Map/Solved` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 Today we will be using the provided [00-react-app](../../01-Class-Content/20-React/01-Activities/00-react-app) React app for all of our activities this week.

    * 🔑 First, we will need to copy the [src](../../01-Class-Content/20-React/01-Activities/01-Component-Map/Solved/src) folder and paste it into the [00-react-app/](../00-react-app/) app. 

    * 🔑 Then, we navigate to [00-react-app](../../01-Class-Content/20-React/01-Activities/00-react-app) and start the app in dev mode by running `npm start` from the command line.

    * 🔑 This will automatically open the browser to <http://localhost:3000>. 
    
    * 🔑 We see a list of grocery items rendered on the page.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used this in Lesson 1 when we mapped over the categories and listed them on the page.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We will need to know how to map over an array of objects and display them on the page, like the projects for the portfolio.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We will need to map over the groceries and render a `<li>` tag for each item to display them on the page.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 4. Student Do: Component Map (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-Component-Map/README.md`.

```md
# Component Map

In this activity, you will map over a list of groceries and render each item in an unordered list on the page.

## Instructions

* **Note** You will be using the same React application, [00-react-app](../00-react-app), for all of our activities today.

* Copy the [src](Unsolved/src) folder and paste it into the [00-react-app/](../00-react-app/) app. 

* Navigate to [01-Activities/00-react-app](../00-react-app) and start the app in dev mode by running `npm start` from your command line.

* Check out the application running on <http://localhost:3000> in your browser. Right now, we don't see any of the grocery items on the page.

* Open [App.js](../00-react-app/src/App.js) and notice the array of groceries. It is passed into the `List` component.

* Open [List.js](../00-react-app/src/components/List.js) and do the following:

  * Inside of the `<ul>` tags, `.map` over the groceries that were passed through props.

  * Render a `<li>` tag for each item and display the `name` property of each item.

* Check the application in your browser to see all of the groceries listed.

* Press `CTRL + C` to stop the server before moving on to the next activity.

## Hint(s)

* You can refer to the React Docs on [Lists and Keys](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/lists-and-keys.html) and the MDN Web Docs on [Array.prototype.map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map).

## Bonus

* For styling purposes, give each `<li>` tag a `className` of `list-group-item`.
```

### 5. Instructor Review: Component Map (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ `.map()`

    * ✔️ `<li>`

* Open `01-Component-Map/Solved/src/components/List.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * First, we notice how the array of grocery objects is passed into the `List` component from inside of `App`, making it available inside of the `List` component as `props.groceries`.

    ```js
    function List(props) {
    ```

    * 🔑 Inside of the `List` component, we insert JSX curly braces inside of the `<ul>` element. We map over `props.groceries` and return one `<li>` tag for every item in `props.groceries`.

    ```js
    <ul className="list-group">
      {props.groceries.map(item => (
        <li className="list-group-item" key={item.id}>
    ```

    * 🔑 It is important to note that we need to include the `key` property attached to the `<li>` tag.

    ```js
    <li className="list-group-item" key={item.id}>
    ```

    * Finally, we render the `item.name` on to the page.

    ```js
    {item.name}
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What type of value is returned by the map method here?

    * 🙋 The `.map()` method will always return an array — in our case, it is returning an array of JSX elements.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 1, read the React Docs on [Lists and Keys](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/lists-and-keys.html), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 6. Instructor Demo: useState Counter (5 min) 

* Open `02-useState-Counter/Solved` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 Again, we will need to copy the [src](../../01-Class-Content/20-React/01-Activities/02-useState-Counter/Solved/src) folder and replace the `src` folder in the [00-react-app/](../00-react-app/) app with this one.

    * 🔑 Then, we navigate to [00-react-app](../../01-Class-Content/20-React/01-Activities/00-react-app) and start the app in dev mode by running `npm start` from the command line.

    * 🔑 This will automatically open the browser to <http://localhost:3000>.

    * 🔑 There is a counter and we can increment or decrement the value by clicking the buttons.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used React Hooks in Lesson 3. We used `useState` to manage the categories.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We will be using React Hooks in the challenge to manage state within a component.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We need to use `useState` in order to declare a new state variable and then add a click handler to the two buttons so that when they are clicked, it will change the state.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 7. Student Do: useState Counter (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-useState-Counter/README.md`.

```md
# useState Counter

In this activity, you will use the `useState` Hook to declare a state variable and update it by incrementing or decrementing using click handlers on buttons. 

## Instructions

* **Note** You will be using the same React application, [00-react-app](../00-react-app), for all of our activities today. Stop the server if it is still running.

* Copy the [src](Unsolved/src) folder and swap out the previous `src` folder in the [00-react-app/](../00-react-app/) app with this one.

* Navigate to [01-Activities/00-react-app](../00-react-app) and start the app in dev mode by running `npm start` from your command line.

* Check out the application running on <http://localhost:3000> in your browser. We see two buttons but nothing happens when we click them. Also the "Click Count" is blank.

* Open [Counter.js](../00-react-app/src/components/Counter.js) and implement the following:

  * Import `useState` Hook from React.

  * Inside the `Counter` component, using `useState`, declare a new state variable `count` and initialize it to zero by passing `0` as the `useState` argument. Name the returned setter method `setCount`.

  * Show the current `count` value.

  * Add a click handler to the two buttons so that when the buttons are clicked, `setCount` is called and `count` is assigned a new incremented or decremented value respectively.

* Check the application in your browser to see if the counter works properly.

* Press `CTRL + C` to stop the server.

## Hint(s)

* You can refer to the React Docs on [Using the State Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html).
```


### 8. Instructor Review: useState Counter (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ `useState`

    * ✔️ `{count}`

    * ✔️ `onClick`

* Open `02-useState-Counter/Solved/src/components/Counter.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * First, we need to import `useState` from React.

    ```js
    import React, { useState } from 'react';
    ```

    * 🔑 Next, we declare a new state variable called `count` and initialize it to zero. We name the setter method `setCount`. We will use this later to change the state.

    ```js
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    ```

    * 🔑 On the page, we need to render the current count.

    ```js
    <p className="card-text">Click Count: {count}</p>
    ```

    * 🔑 Then, on the buttons, we add a click handler to call `setCount` and change the `count` value by 1, whether that's through adding or subtracting.

    ```js
    <button className="btn btn-primary" onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Increment
    </button>{' '}
    <button className="btn btn-danger" onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>
      Decrement
    </button>
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What exactly are Hooks?

    * 🙋 Hooks are just JavaScript functions that follow two rules:

        1. Only call Hooks from React functions

        2. Only call Hooks at the top level

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 3, read the React Docs on [Using the State Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 09. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

    * 🙋 We learned how to utilize the `.map()` method in order to render JSX from an array of objects. We also learned about React Hooks, mainly `useState`.

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful. 

    * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

    * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer. 

    * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

    * 🙋 Mapping to render JSX is covered in Lesson 1 and React Hooks are covered in Lesson 3. 

    * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Use student answers to transition to Office Hours.


### 10. Office Hours (30 min)

* Announce Office Hours and invite students to stay on the Zoom and start the challenge while they have live support from instructional staff.
