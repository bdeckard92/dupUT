## Class Instructions 

### 1. Introduction (5 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Direct students to post individual questions in the Zoom chat to be addressed by TAs and/or at the end of class.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è How are you feeling about your progress so far?

    * üôã We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back and see what we accomplished, and acknowledge that it's a lot! It‚Äôs also okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don‚Äôt give up.

    * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with this topic? 

    * üôã Let's do "fist to five" together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).


### 2. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)


* [Click here for CodeSignal challenge](https://app.codesignal.com/public-test/jYHQ873GTw8sCwmDv/3LodRHTbsfXA6s) 

* Remind students that practicing algorithm-based interview questions is one of the best ways to prep for interviews because:

    * companies often use algorithm questions to test candidates knowledge, despite not using these kinds of algorithms every day

    * it is great practice to learn new JavaScript methods and to solidify knowledge

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è Did anyone attempt the Code Signal algorithm?

    * üôã It is encouraged to take advantage of the CodeSignal practice because it reflects real-world online interviewing.

* Open your IDE and review the solution to the CodeSignal algorithm:

    * The algorithm is called `missingOnes`. We are given an input string, `s` and we are asked to replace each digit to the corresponding number of ones (1s).

    * For `s = "abc5bc3"`, the output should be `changeToOnes(s) = "abc11111bc111"`.

    * The instructions provide the following details regarding input and output:

    ```md
    [execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)

    [input] string s

    The string consisting of Latin letters and digits.

    Guaranteed constraints:
    1 ‚â§ s.length ‚â§ 100.

    [output] string

    The input string with digits replaced to the corresponding number of ones.
    ```

    * We are also provided the following starter code:

    ```js
    function changeToOnes(s) {

    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òù) and call on students for answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What is the first step to solve this problem?

    * üôã We will want a placeholder to hold the new string while we look through the original string and replace any digits with ones.

    * ‚òùÔ∏è Right! So setting up the template of our answer might look something like this:

    ```js
    // empty string for the result
    let result = '';
    
    // set up the for loop
    for(let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {

        // our logic here

    }
    ```

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What did you do next?

    * üôã So inside the for loop, we need to check if each of the characters is a string digit between '0' and '9', and if it is, replace it with the corresponding number of ones.

    * ‚òùÔ∏è Yes, but how would we check whether the value is a digit?

    * üôã One way is to just use less than and greater than, with string digits, it'll still work:

    ```js
    if (s[i] >= '0' && s[i] <= '9') {
        // replace with the right number of ones
    }
    ```

     * ‚òùÔ∏è Perfect, so let's go ahead and change the digit to ones. This can be done with a simple for loop as long as we remember to `parseInt()` the string digit.

     ```js
    for (let j = 0; j < parseInt(s[i]); j++) {

        // here we are adding those 1s into the placeholder result variable
        result += '1';
    }
     ```

    * üôã And for those that are not digits, we can just concatenate them straight into the placeholder variable!

    * ‚òùÔ∏è Exactly, so our logic as a whole will look like this:

    ```js
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (s[i] >= '0' && s[i] <= '9') {
            for (let j = 0; j < parseInt(s[i]); j++) {
                result += '1';
            }
        } else {
            result += s[i];
        }
    }
    return result;
    ```
* Answer any remaining questions and move on to the next activity. 

* Full solution:

```js
function changeToOnes(s) {
    let result = '';
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if ('0' <= s[i] && s[i] <= '9') {
            for (let j = 0; j < parseInt(s[i]); j++) {
                result += '1';
            }
        } else {
            result += s[i];
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer. 

    * ‚òùÔ∏è Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

    * üôã @TODO { YES, WHERE? }

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Use student answers to transition to Office Hours.


### 10. Office Hours (30 min)

* Announce Office Hours and invite students to stay on the Zoom and start the challenge while they have live support from instructional staff.
