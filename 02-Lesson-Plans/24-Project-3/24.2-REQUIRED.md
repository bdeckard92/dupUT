## Class Instructions

### 0. Office Hours (30 min)

* Use office hours to assist with any last minute debugging and deployment issues.

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

* Welcome students to class. Congratulate your class for developing their projects to a state worth presenting!

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What needs to be included in your 10-minute presentation? 

    * 🙋 Elevator pitch, Concept, Process, Demo, Directions for future development, and links to the deployed application and GitHub repo.

* Ask which groups would like to go first and write them down on a list. When groups stop responding, assign the remaining teams to random slots. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the presentations.

### 2. Project Presentations & Superlatives (105 min)

* Divide this time block by the number of student groups presenting.

* Follow each of these presentations up with questions about their projects. Let TAs and classmates ask questions, too.

* When the Q&A session ends, point out what you found impressive and what they can improve on for future demonstrations.

* Present superlative 'awards' after all of the presentations are complete and congratulate each group for accomplishing this huge milestone!

### 3. Recap & Promote Additional Resources (5 min)

* Congratulate the students on finishing their final project presentations! It's challenging to conceive, develop and present a new web application. Remind them how much they've learned over the past 6 months:

    * They started by mastering the foundational front-end technologies that all websites use. 
    
    * Next, they added back-end technologies to create full-stack applications. 
    
    * Finally, they learned how to make applications more performant and efficient by using cutting-edge technologies to create scalable MERN stack applications.

* Remind the class that **each member of the group** is required to submit the deployed application, GitHub repository, and their portfolio with the project added to it by **this upcoming Sunday**. 

* Encourage the students to RSVP for the upcoming **Demo Day**. An invitation email will be sent out or they can reach out to their Program Support Manager for the link.

* Direct students to the additional resources available to them:

    * Reflection and Retrieval

    * Career Connection

### 4. Office Hours (30 min)

* Announce Office Hours and encourage students to stay on the Zoom and continue working on their final project while they have live support from instructional staff. 

### 5. End
