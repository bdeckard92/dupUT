# Module 24 Virtual Class: Project 3 (Continued)

## Overview

In today's virtual class, students will present their projects in groups.


## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Demonstrate deployed projects

* Explain the technical implementation of their projects

* Describe their individual roles and contributions to their projects


## Instructor Notes 

* This is a major milestone for students. Be sure to congratulate them!

* At the beginning of today‚Äôs class, please let students know they will be prompted to complete the **End-of-Course Survey** that covers their journey thus far. It‚Äôs important that they are aware of this in advance and that they take their time to complete the survey. This will ultimately help us understand how the program, the curriculum, the instruction, and our support can be improved!

* Keep an eye on time to ensure every group has an opportunity to present. 

* If you haven't already, prepare [Superlative Awards](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QlPJhHnHvLLtKheKl4opm7tibkjjALZeAzwVvZdJDO0/edit?usp=sharing) to give each group at the end of this session.

* Remind students about Demo Day.

## Office Hours

Use office hours to assist with any last minute debugging and deployment issues, or to provide feedback on presentations.

## Class Instructions

### 0. Office Hours (30 min)

* Use office hours to assist with any last minute debugging and deployment issues.

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

* Welcome students to class. Congratulate your class for developing their projects to a state worth presenting!

* Remind students to complete the End of Course survey!

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What needs to be included in your 10-minute presentation? 

    * üôã Elevator pitch, Concept, Process, Demo, Directions for future development, and links to the deployed application and GitHub repo.

* Ask which groups would like to go first and write them down on a list. When groups stop responding, assign the remaining teams to random slots. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the presentations.

### 2. Project Presentations & Superlatives (105 min)

* Divide this time block by the number of student groups presenting.

* Follow each of these presentations up with questions about their projects. Let TAs and classmates ask questions, too.

* When the Q&A session ends, point out what you found impressive and what they can improve on for future demonstrations.

* Present superlative 'awards' after all of the presentations are complete and congratulate each group for accomplishing this huge milestone!

### 3. Recap & Promote Additional Resources (5 min)

* Congratulate the students on finishing their final project presentations! It's challenging to conceive, develop, and present a new web application. Remind them how much they've learned over the past 6 months:

    * They started by mastering the foundational front-end technologies that all websites use. 
    
    * Next, they added back-end technologies to create full-stack applications. 
    
    * Finally, they learned how to make applications more performant and efficient by using cutting-edge technologies to create scalable MERN stack applications.

* Remind the class that **each member of the group** is required to submit the deployed application, GitHub repository, and their portfolio with the project added to it by **this upcoming Sunday**. 

* Encourage the students to RSVP for the upcoming **Demo Day**. An invitation email will be sent out or they can reach out to their Student Success Manager for the link.

* Direct students to the additional resources available to them:

    * Reflection and Retrieval

    * Career Connection
