# Module 24 Instructor Overview: Project 3 (Continued)

## Overview

In this week's virtual classes, students will continue working on their projects, deploy their projects, and present their projects as groups to their classmates. 

## Virtual Classes

[Required](./24.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* There is no lesson plan for the Recommended session. Use the entirety of the class time as office hours to assist students with their projects. In place of lecture and activities, hold stand-up meetings with each group to gauge progress and advise as necessary.

* Share the [Project Presentation Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_u8TKy5zW5UlrVQVnyDEZ0unGI2tjQPDEpA0FNuBKAw/edit) with students early in the week to give them ample time to prepare for their presentations.

* Prepare a slide deck of superlative 'awards' to give to each group. Use [this example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QlPJhHnHvLLtKheKl4opm7tibkjjALZeAzwVvZdJDO0/edit?usp=sharing), feeling free to customize as you see fit for your cohort. 

* Divide the Required session class time by the number of groups presenting to give each group sufficient time to discuss their projects. Be sure to leave time for you and the TAs to present superlatives at the end of class.
