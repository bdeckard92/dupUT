# Module 24 Instructor Overview: Project 3 (Continued)

## Overview

In this week's virtual classes, students will finish their projects, deploy and submit their projects, and present their projects as groups to their classmates. 

## Virtual Classes

[Virtual Class 24.2](./24.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* There is no lesson plan for the first virtual class this week. Use the entirety of the class time as office hours to assist students with their projects. In place of lecture and activities, hold stand-up meetings with each group to gauge progress and advise as necessary.

* Share the [Project Presentation Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10QaO9KH8HtUXj__81ve0SZcpO5DbMbqqQr4iPpbwKks/edit?usp=sharing) with students early in the week to give them ample time to prepare for their presentations.

* Prepare a slide deck of superlative awards to give to each group. Use [this example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QlPJhHnHvLLtKheKl4opm7tibkjjALZeAzwVvZdJDO0/edit?usp=sharing), and feel free to customize it as you see fit for your cohort.

* Divide this week's second virtual class time by the number of groups presenting to give each group sufficient time to discuss their projects. Be sure to leave time for you and the TAs to present superlatives at the end of class.

* Remind students to complete the End-of-Course Survey that covers their journey through this bootcamp. It’s important that they are aware of this in advance and that they take their time to complete the survey. This will ultimately help us understand how the program, the curriculum, the instruction, and our support can be improved!

## Career Connection

Now that you are in the last week of boot camp, it's more important than ever that students meet with their Career Coach more than ever.  Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Coach and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp).

## Heads-Up

* Remind the class that **each member of the group** is required to submit the deployed application, GitHub repository, and their portfolio with the project added to it by **this week's second Virtual Class**. 

* Encourage the students to RSVP for the upcoming **Demo Day**. An invitation email will be sent out or they can reach out to their Student Success Manager for the link.
