# Module 24 Instructor Overview: Project 03

## Overview

In this module, students will finish their projects, deploy and submit their projects, and present their projects as groups to their classmates.

## Virtual Classes

Here are the lesson plans for this week's virtual classes:

* [24.1 Virtual Class](./24.1-REQUIRED.md)

* [24.2 Virtual Class](./24.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* Early in the week, share the [project presentation template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10QaO9KH8HtUXj__81ve0SZcpO5DbMbqqQr4iPpbwKks/edit?usp=sharing) with students so they have ample time to prepare for their presentations.

* Students must have a deployed project by presentation day, so encourage students to deploy their projects by the class before presentation day at the latest. Deployed projects can always be updated, so it is recommended that students deploy early on and update their live version with every new feature.

* Prepare a slide deck of superlative awards to give to each group. Use this [example of a superlative awards slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fJGzsclaQ5TKBk3EnL7Gc-bg1ijSGM6_oB1gvpKYnZE/edit?usp=sharing), and feel free to customize it for your cohort.

* Divide this week's second virtual class time by the number of groups presenting in order to give each group enough time to discuss their projects. Be sure to leave time for you and the TAs to present superlatives at the end of class.

* Remind students to complete the **End-of-Course Survey** that covers their journey through this boot camp. It’s important that they are aware of this in advance and that they take their time to complete the survey. This will ultimately help us understand how the program, the curriculum, the instruction, and our support can be improved!

## Career Connection

Now that you are in the last week of boot camp, it's more important than ever that students meet with their Career Coach more than ever. Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Coach and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp).

If you'd like more information on career services, visit the [career services resources page](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp).

## Heads-Up

* Remind the class that **each member of the group** is required to submit the deployed application, GitHub repository, and their portfolio with the project added to it by **this week's second Virtual Class**.

* Encourage the students to RSVP for the upcoming **Demo Day**. An invitation email will be sent out or they can reach out to their Student Success Manager for the link.
