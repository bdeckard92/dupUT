# Module 01 Required Session: HTML-Git-CSS

## Overview

In today's required session, students will review CSS, relative paths, and deploying to GitHub Personal Pages.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Use CSS to style and layout a simple HTML 'portfolio'

* Implement relative paths to connect files between directories

- Deploy a project using GitHub Personal Pages.

## Instructor Notes

* In today's class, you will introduce and demonstrate the module challenge. Find time prior to class to install dependencies, read the acceptance criteria, and familiarize yourself with the application functionality so you are prepared to answer any questions.

* The solution to the first activity requires floats. Students wlll likely struggle finding it. If it's been awhile, you may want to refresh your knowledge on floats in order to improvise demos and field any questions.

- If you are unfamiliar with GitHub Pages, you will want to perform a dry run of a deployment prior to class.  Consult the [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) documentation for instructions. If you are already using GitHub Pages for a Personal site, you will either need to demo a Project page or create a dummy GitHub account.

* @TODO { REFERENCE TO ASYNC }

## Office Hours

Use Office Hours to assist students in troubleshooting installations and configurations of their development tools.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

- Welcome students to class.

- Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  - ☝️ What did you learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

  - 🙋 @TODO We learned { X, Y & Z }. We are moving fast compared to traditional learners. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

  - ☝️ Did anyone have an "Aha!" or "Eureka!" moment this week? When was it and why did things suddenly click for you?

  - 🙋 Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we're thinking about it.

  - ☝️ Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

  - 🙋 It's easy to get stuck when you're learning web development. It's important to learn how to get unstuck because it happens to the pros too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the tool's official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups are great because explaining your problems to someone else often reveals the solution.

### 2. Instructor Do: Introduce Module Challenge (5 min)

- Open `01-Class-Content/01-HTML-Git-CSS/02-Challenge/Master/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  - The challenge is a landing page for a marketing agency. It features a navbar, three sections and a sidebar.

  - When we click a link in the navigation, the window scrolls to the corresponding section.

- Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  - ☝️ What recently acquired skills will help us build this challenge?

  - 🙋 HTML and CSS!

  - ☝️ How are these skills relevant to a career in web development?

  - 🙋 HTML and CSS are two of the three fundamental pillars of web development.

  - ☝️ How will this challenge improve your portfolio?

  - 🙋 This challenge is a first step towards building our own portfolios.

- Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 3. Instructor Demo: HTML + CSS (5 min)

- Use the prompts and talking points below to demonstrate the following key (🔑) points:

  - ✔️ Using CSS to position elements

  - ✔️ Heading, paragraph, image, list and anchor HTML elements.

@TODO USE THE FOLLOWING FOR BROWSER AND/OR COMMAND LINE DEMOS, RESPECTIVELY. REMOVE IF UNUSED

- Open `03-Stu_HTML-CSS/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  - 🔑 This is a simple portfolio built using HTML and CSS. It follows accessible standards by using only one top-level section heading and two second-level headings. We also see it features an image, using a placeholder. We can update this with our own. The portfolio uses an unordered list in the contact section to display important information. We use anchor tags to create links for email, and GitHub and LinkedIn profiles.

  - 🔑 The portfolio uses CSS for "style" and to position the contact section.

- Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  - ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  - 🙋 @TODO We used this to accomplish { X, Y, Z }, in { CORRESPONDING ASYNCHRONOUS LESSON PLAN }.

  - ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  - 🙋 This activity requires us to use HTML and CSS to build a static site.

  - ☝️ How would we build this?

  - 🙋 We would start by scaffolding our HTML document with `<html>`, `<head>` and `<body>` tags. We would then create sections with relevant headings and corresponding content, such as the `<image>` and `<ul>` elements. Lastly, we would use CSS to add style and position elements.

- Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: HTML + CSS (15 min)

- Divide students into breakout rooms.

- Direct students to the activity instructions found in `03-Stu_HTML-CSS/README.md`.

```md
    # HTML + CSS

    ## Instructions

    Using the starter code found in the `Unsolved` folder, use CSS to style the page and position elements according to the design in the following image:

    ![](html-css-mockup.png)
```

### 5. Instructor Review: HTML + CSS (10 min)

- Bring students back from breakout rooms.

- Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  - ✔️ Positioning elements with CSS float

  - ✔️ Linking an external stylesheet

- Open `03-Stu_HTML-CSS/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

  - 🔑 We use the `<link>` tag in the `<head>` of our document to _link_ our stylesheet.

  ```html
    <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>HTML + CSS</title>

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./css/style.css" />
  </head>
  ```

  - The body of our document is very simliar to previous activity files. 

  ```html
  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>Your Name</h1>
    </header>

    <div class="container">
      <section id="main-bio">
        <h2>Portfolio</h2>

        <img
          id="bio-image"
          src="https://placehold.it/200x200"
          alt="Your Name"
        />

        <p>
          Write a short paragraph or two about yourself, or use placeholder text
          from <a href="http://www.lipsum.com/">www.lipsum.com</a>
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="contact-info">
        <h2>Contact Info</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="#">someplace@gmail.com</a></li>
          <li><strong>Github:</strong> <a href="#">sampleName</a></li>
          <li><strong>LinkedIn:</strong> <a href="#">coming soon</a></li>
        </ul>
      </section>
    </div>
  </body>
  ```

  - 📝 Note that we add a `container` class to our `<div>` and ids to each of our sections, `main-bio` and `contact-info`. 

- Open `03-Stu_HTML-CSS/Solved/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

    - Our `container` class declaration constrains the width of the `<div>` to which it is applied to 1024px. We center the `<div>` using the `margin` property and set its values to 0 and `auto`. 

  ```css
  .container {
    width: 1024px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    }
  ```

  - 📝 This is referred to as a **shorthand property**. The first value, 0, represents the vertical (top and bottom) values, the second, `auto`, represents the horizontal (left and right) values. It is the same as writing out, `margin: 0 auto 0 auto`.

  * 🔑 We float the elements with the `#main-bio`, the `#contact-info`, and the `bio-image` using the `left` value.

  ```css
    #main-bio,
    #contact-info,
    #bio-image {
        float: left;
    }

    #main-bio {
    width: 70%;
    }

    #contact-info {
    width: 30%;
    }
  ```

- Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  - ☝️ Why do we our `#main-bio` and `#contact-info` sections width percentages of 70 and 30?

  - 🙋 In order to get our `#main-bio` and `#contact-info` sections side-by-side, we assign the elements `width` properties with percentage values that total 100.

  - ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

  - 🙋 We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [MDN float documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/float), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

- Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Relative Paths (5 min)

- Use the prompts and talking points below to demonstrate the following key (🔑) points:

  - ✔️ Relative paths

- Open `04-Sty_Relative-Paths/Unsolved/WorkingExample/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  - This is the portfolio we styled in the previous activity. 

- Open `04-Sty_Relative-Paths/Unsolved/WorkingExample/index.html` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  - 🔑 We link our stylesheet using a relative path. 

  ```html
    href="./assets/style.css"
  ```

  - We refer to it as a "relative path" because the location of our `style.css` file is _relative_ to the location of our `index.html`. An absolute path, on the other hand, would look something like the following: 

  ```html
  href="/home/jarednielsen/apps/fullstack-online/01-Class-Content/01-HTML-Git-CSS/01-Activities/04-Stu_Relative-Paths/Unsolved/RelativePaths_WorkingExample/assets/style.css"
  ```

- Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  - ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  - 🙋 @TODO We used this to accomplish { X, Y, Z }, in { CORRESPONDING ASYNCHRONOUS LESSON PLAN }.

  - ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  - 🙋 We will need to create one or more CSS files in addition to our `index.html` file. We need to ensure they are linked by their relative path to render correctly through GitHub Pages.

- Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Relative Paths (15 min)

- Divide students into breakout rooms.

- Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Stu_Relative-Paths`.

```md
    # Relative Paths

    ## Instructions

    Correctly link the `style.css` for each of the four `index.html` files in their containing folders. Don't move either the CSS or HTML files. 

    ## Hint(s):

    You only need to change the relative path in the `<link>` tag.
```

### 8. Instructor Review: Relative Paths (10 min)

- Bring students back from breakout rooms.

- Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  - ✔️ Relative paths

- Open `04-Stu_Relative-Paths/Solved/01/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

  - 🔑 Our stylesheet is in the same directory as our HTML file, so we simply add the name and extension of our file to the `<link>` tag.

  ```HTML
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./style.css">
  ```

- Open `04-Stu_Relative-Paths/Solved/02/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

  - 🔑 Our stylesheet is in an `assets` folder which is in the same directory as our HTML file. We need to declare the relative path to our stylesheet.

    ```HTML
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./assets/style.css">
    ```

- Open `04-Stu_Relative-Paths/Solved/03/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

    * 🔑 Our stylesheet is now in a `style` directory inside our `assets` directory.

    ```html
      <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="assets/style/style.css">
    ```

- Open `04-Stu_Relative-Paths/Solved/04/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

    * A trick question! Our HTML file is in a direcotry, but our stylesheet is outside it. If we want to link to a file that is in a parent directory, we use two dots, rather than one. 

    ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../style.css">
    ```

- Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  - ☝️ What does one dot, `.`, represent?

  - 🙋 One dot represents the current directory.

  - ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understanding this?

  - 🙋 We can refer to the lesson plan, read the MDN article on [Dealing with files](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Dealing_with_files)), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

- Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

- Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  - ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  - 🙋 @TODO We used this to accomplish { X, Y, Z }, in { CORRESPONDING ASYNCHRONOUS LESSON PLAN }.

  - ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  - 🙋 A functional, _deployed_ application is requirement of every challenge.

  - ☝️ How would we build this?

  - 🙋 @TODO { YES, HOW? }

- Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 10. Student Do: GitHub Pages Personal (20 min)

  ```

  - 🔑 @TODO DON'T FORGET TO USE THE KEY EMOJI ON KEY POINTS, BUT ONLY KEY POINTS, NOT _EVERY_ POINT

- Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  - ☝️ @TODO { DO WE END OUR REVIEWS WITH A QUESTION? }

  - 🙋 @TODO { YES, WE DO! }

  - ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understanding this?

- Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  - ☝️ What do you think you absolutely need to know to succeed at the challenge?

  - 🙋 To succeed at the challenge, we need to know how to add CSS to our HTML by linking stylesheets via relative paths, how to position HTML elements with floats, and how to deploy our projects to GitHub Pages.

  - ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

  - 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it is not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful.

  - ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material prior to class as possible?

  - 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp.
