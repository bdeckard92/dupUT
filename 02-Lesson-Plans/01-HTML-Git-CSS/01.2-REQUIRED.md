# Module 01 Required Session: HTML-Git-CSS

## Overview

In today's required session, students will review CSS, relative paths, and deploying to GitHub Personal Pages.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

- Use CSS to style and layout a simple HTML 'portfolio'

- Implement relative paths to connect files between directories

- Deploy a project using GitHub Personal Pages.

## Instructor Notes

- In today's class, you will introduce and demo the module challenge. Find time prior to class to install any dependencies, read the acceptance criteria, and familiarize yourself with the application functionality so you are prepared to answer any questions.

* The solution to the first activity requires floats. Students wlll likely struggle finding it. If it's been awhile, you may want to refresh your knowledge on floats in order to improvise demos and field any questions.

* If you are unfamiliar with GitHub Pages, you will want to perform a dry run of a deployment prior to class. Consult the [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) documentation for instructions.

* @TODO { REFERENCE TO ASYNC }

## Office Hours

Use Office Hours to assist students in troubleshooting installations and configurations of their development tools.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

- Welcome students to class.

- Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  - ☝️ What did you learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

  - 🙋 @TODO We learned { X, Y & Z }. We are moving fast compared to traditional learners. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

  - ☝️ Did anyone have an "Aha!" or "Eureka!" moment this week? When was it and why did things suddenly click for you?

  - 🙋 Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we're thinking about it.

  - ☝️ Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

  - 🙋 It's easy to get stuck when you're learning web development. It's important to learn how to get unstuck because it happens to the pros too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the tool's official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups are great because explaining your problems to someone else often reveals the solution.

### 2. Instructor Do: Introduce Module Challenge (5 min)

- Open `01-Class-Content/01-HTML-Git-CSS/02-Challenge/Master/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  - The challenge is a landing page for a marketing agency. It features a navbar, three sections and a sidebar.

  - When we click a link in the navigation, the window scrolls to the corresponding section.

- Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  - ☝️ What recently acquired skills will help us build this challenge?

  - 🙋 HTML and CSS!

  - ☝️ How are these skills relevant to a career in web development?

  - 🙋 HTML and CSS are two of the three fundamental pillars of web development.

  - ☝️ How will this challenge improve your portfolio?

  - 🙋 This challenge is a first step towards building our own portfolios.

- Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 3. Instructor Demo: HTML + CSS (5 min)

- Use the prompts and talking points below to demonstrate the following key (🔑) points:

@TODO USE THE FOLLOWING FOR BROWSER AND/OR COMMAND LINE DEMOS, RESPECTIVELY. REMOVE IF UNUSED

- Open `03-Stu_HTML-CSS/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  - 🔑 This is a simple portfolio built using HTML and CSS. It follows accessible standards by using only one top-level section heading and two second-level headings. We also see it features an image, using a placeholder. We can update this with our own. The portfolio uses an unordered list in the contact section to display important information. We use anchor tags to create links for email, and GitHub and LinkedIn profiles.

  - 🔑 The portfolio uses CSS to position the contact section.

- Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  - ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  - 🙋 @TODO We used this to accomplish { X, Y, Z }, in { CORRESPONDING ASYNCHRONOUS LESSON PLAN }.

  - ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  - 🙋 This activity requires us to use HTML and CSS to build a static site.

  - ☝️ How would we build this?

  - 🙋 We would start by scaffolding our HTML document with `<html>`, `<head>` and `<body>` tags. We would then create sections with relevant headings and corresponding content, such as the `<image>` and `<ul>` elements. Lastly, we would use CSS to add style and position elements.

- Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.
