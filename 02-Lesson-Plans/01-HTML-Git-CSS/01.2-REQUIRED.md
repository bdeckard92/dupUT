# Module 01 Virtual Class: HTML, CSS, and Git

## Overview

In today's virtual class, students will review CSS Selectors, the box model, and CSS Positioning.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Select an HTML element to style using CSS selectors.

* Determine how an element is positioned in an HTML document using the CSS position property.

* Identify the box model and its role in web design and layout.

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try and anticipate questions students may have.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* In today's class, you will introduce and demonstrate the module Challenge. Find time prior to class to install dependencies, read the acceptance criteria, and familiarize yourself with the application functionality so you are prepared to answer any questions.

* If you are unfamiliar with GitHub Pages, you will want to perform a dry run of a deployment prior to class.  Consult the [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) documentation for instructions. If you are already using GitHub Pages for a Personal site, you will either need to demo a Project page or create a dummy GitHub account.

* Students learned how to use CSS, the box model, and positioning in lesson 2. A more advanced discussion of CSS Selectors, the box model and positioning is found in Lesson 3.

## Office Hours

Use Office Hours to assist students in troubleshooting installations and configurations of their development tools.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What did you learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

  * 🙋 We learned about the basics of HTML and CSS. We also started to learn about Git for version control. We are moving fast compared to traditional learners. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

  * ☝️ Did anyone have an "Aha!" or "Eureka!" moment this week? When was it and why did things suddenly click for you?

  * 🙋 Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we're thinking about it.

  * ☝️ Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

  * 🙋 It's easy to get stuck when you're learning web development. It's important to learn how to get unstuck because it happens to the pros too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the tool's official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups are great because explaining your problems to someone else often reveals the solution.

### 2. Instructor Do: Introduce Module Challenge (5 min)

* Open `01-Class-Content/01-HTML-Git-CSS/02-Challenge/Main/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * The challenge is a landing page for a marketing agency. It features a navbar, three sections and a sidebar.

  * When we click a link in the navigation, the window scrolls to the corresponding section.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What recently acquired skills will help us build this challenge?

  * 🙋 HTML and CSS!

  * ☝️ How are these skills relevant to a career in web development?

  * 🙋 HTML and CSS are two of the three fundamental pillars of web development.

  * ☝️ How will this challenge improve your portfolio?

  * 🙋 This challenge is a first step towards building our own portfolios.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 3. Instructor Demo: CSS Selectors (5 min) 

  * So far, we have focused on using `class` and `id` to select and style HTML elements. Alternatively, we can use a range of selectors to style the webpage&mdash;for an identical result in the browser.

  * Open `03-CSS-Selectors/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

    * We use a **universal selector** to apply a style to all the elements on a page:

      ```css
      font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode", "Lucida Grande", sans-serif;
      ```

    * We can also select by the element's tag name, which will apply the styles to all the elements with that name and any elements nested in that element. This approach allows us to apply the same font size to all the paragraphs or determine a uniform height and width for all sections:

      ```css
      header,
      footer {
        width: 100%;
        height: 100px;
        line-height: 100px;
        color: #f0ead6;
        background-color: #191970;
      }
      ```

    * We have already been using **class selectors**! Class selectors select all the elements that have that class attribute attached:

      ```css
      .highlighted-text {
        font-weight: bolder;
      }
      ```

    * We have also been using **id selectors**. Id selectors apply a style to a single element:

      ```css
      #contact-section {
        background-color: #f0ead6;
      }
      ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We used CSS Selectors in lesson 2. Although selectors do not change how the styles display on the page, we can choose selectors with a purpose in mind. If we want to style all the elements, we can use a universal selector. If we want to style only one specific element, we might choose an id selector.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  * 🙋 This activity requires us to use an external stylesheet and CSS selectors. Both are needed to understand the challenge. 

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We would start by examining the HTML elements in our `index.html` file and filling in the content with our own information. Then we would create a `style.css` file to add style and position elements.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: CSS Selectors (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

 ```md
  # 📐 Add Comments to Implementation of CSS Selectors

  Work with a partner to add comments describing the functionality of the code found in [Unsolved](./Unsolved/assets/css/style.css).

  ## 📝 Notes

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What are pseudo-class selectors? 

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 5. Instructor Review: CSS Selectors (15 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with selectors? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ Universal selectors

  * ✔️ Element selectors

  * ✔️ Class selectors

  * ✔️ Id selectors

* Open `03-CSS-Selectors/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * For this activity, you were asked to provide comments on existing code, allowing you to solidify your understanding and practice explaining code in plain language.

  * 🔑 For this code snippet, you might write a comment that explains that because this is a universal selector, the font family will be applied to all the elements on the page:

    ```css
    * {
      font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode", "Lucida Grande", sans-serif;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 This element selector applies a background color to the body element:

    ```css
    body {
      background-color: lemonchiffon;
    }
    ```

  * This rule block looks different because there are two selectors. When rule blocks have more than one selector, the styling will apply to all the elements of both selectors. (If code looks unfamiliar, it is a good opportunity to check the documentation.)

    ```css
    header,
    footer {
      width: 100%;
      height: 100px;
      line-height: 100px;
      color: #f0ead6;
      background-color: #191970;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 We use a class selector to select all the HTML elements with that class attribute. To specify that the selector is a class selector, we place a `.` in front of the name in the CSS:

    ```css
    .highlighted-text {
      font-weight: bolder;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 We use an id selector to select a single element. The style will be applied to that element alone:

    ```css
    #contact-section {
      background-color: #f0ead6;
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How do selectors help us style code?

  * 🙋 Selectors define the elements to which a set of CSS rules apply. Universal selectors will apply styles to all the elements on the page, while id selectors will style on a single element. We pick the selectors based on the specificity required.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on CSS selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Box Model (5 min)

* Open `17-Ins_CSS-box-model/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * In HTML, all elements are boxes. We use the **box model** to describe the amount of space that each element will occupy.

  * The innermost layer of the box is the content itself. The content has height and width.

  * The next layer is the **padding** that surrounds the content. We use CSS to set the width of the padding.

  * The **border** surrounds the padding. Like the padding, the width of the border is set by CSS.

  * Finally, the **margin** is the area outside the border.

* Open `03-Box-Model/assets/css/style.css` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * We use CSS to set the width of the padding, border, and margins.

  * The CSS `padding` property sets the width of the padding. In this case, all sides will have a width of 20px:

    ```css
    padding: 20px;
    ```

  * The CSS `border` property sets the width of the border, the type of the border, and the color:

    ```css
    border: 9px solid darkblue;
    ```

  * The CSS `margin` property sets the width of the margin. The margin on each side is 20px here:

    ```css
    margin: 20px;
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are the four components of the box model?

  * 🙋 The content, padding, border, and margin.

  * ☝️ How can the box model help us understand layout and design?

  * 🙋 The box model explains how much space an element will occupy on a page, which can inform the overall layout and design.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Box Model (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Box-Model/README.md`.

```md

  ```

### 8. Instructor Review: Box Model (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

 * Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `margin`

  * ✔️ `padding`

  * ✔️ `border`

* Open `04_Box-Model/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * To meet the acceptance criteria, we must center all four images inside the box.

  * The box has a width of 600px and a height of 600px. For the images to fit inside the box, the total combined space they occupy&mdash;including the content, padding, border, and margin&mdash;will have to be less than that:

    ```css
    section {
      width: 600px;
      height: 600px;
      text-align: center;
      border: 15px solid black;
    }
    ```

  * The width and height of the content is 200px:

    ```css
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
    ```

  * 🔑 First we set the margin on every side to 20px:

    ```css
    margin: 20px;
    ```

  * 🔑 We set the padding to 20px as well:

    ```css
    padding: 20px;
    ```

  * 🔑 Finally, we set the width of the border to 9px, make it a solid border, and give it a color of dark blue:

    ```css
    border: 9px solid darkblue;
    ```

* Open `04_Box-Model/Solved/index.html` in your browser and explain the following:

  * The total width of the image is now 20px (left margin) + 9px (border) + 20px (left padding) + 200px (image) + 20px (right padding) + 9px (border) + 20px (right margin)&mdash;for a total of 298px.

  * The total height of the image is also 298px.

  * Because the width of the containing box is 600px and the height is 600px, the boxes fit evenly.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What is the difference between the padding and margin?

  * 🙋 The padding is the space between the content and the border. Padding surrounds the content. Margins determine the space surrounding an element. Both are often adjusted to make an element fit in a space.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on the box model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Instructor Demo: CSS Positioning (5 min)

* Open `19-Ins_CSS-positioning/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * We use the CSS `position` property to set how the element is positioned in a document.

  * The default position is `static`, meaning that the element is positioned based on the normal flow.

  * When an element's position is `relative`, it stays in the normal flow but can be offset by a value provided in the CSS.

  * When an element's position is `absolute`, it is no longer in the normal flow but instead is positioned relative to its ancestor element and is determined by values provided for top, bottom, left, and right.

  * An element in the `fixed` position is also not in the normal flow. However, unlike `absolute`, the position is determined in relation to the viewport.

* Open `19-Ins_CSS-positioning/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We use `position: relative` to set the body element to `relative`. An element that is positioned `relative` means that it is positioned relative to its normal position. Setting the `body` element to relative will make it easy to position the child elements relative to the entire visible page. 
    ```css
    body {
     position: relative;
     margin: 0;
     padding: 0;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 To set an element to `absolute`, we first set the parent element to `relative`:

    ```css
    .absolute-container {
       position: relative;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 We then use `position: absolute` and use the values of `top` and `left` to position the item relative to the parent container. Here, we position the element 0 from the top and 700px from the left. We can also use `bottom` and `right` to position items.

    ```css
    #absolute-box-2 {
      position: absolute;
      top: 0;
      left: 700px;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 To set an inner element to `relative` we use `position:relative` and then set how far we want it adjusted away from its normal position. In this case, we want it adjust 200 px to the left of the normal position. We can also use `right`, `top`, and `bottom` to position an element using relative positioning. 

    ```css
    #relative-box-2 {
      position: relative;
      left: 200px;
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How can we use the CSS `position` property to change the layout of the webpage?

  * 🙋 We use the `position` property to set how an element is positioned in the document, allowing us to move and rearrange elements or even fix them in a certain position relative to the viewport.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 10. Student Do: CSS Positioning (20 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `05-Github-Pages-Personal/README.md`.

  ```md
  # 🏗️ Implement Absolute and Relative Positioning to Change Layout

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to use the CSS position property to change the layout of my page.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when `box 2` is positioned in the middle of `square 1` using relative positioning.

  * It's done when `box 2` is positioned outside of the upper-right corner of `square 2` using absolute positioning.

  * It's done when the finished page matches the mockup.

  ## Assets

  The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

  ![Box 2 is positioned in the center of Square 1, while in Square 2, Box 2 is positioned outside the square.](./assets/image-1.png)

  ---

  ## 💡 Hints

  How does the CSS `position` property change the document's normal flow?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What is the `z-index` property?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 11. Instructor Review: CSS Positioning (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `position: relative`

  * ✔️ `position: absolute`

* Open `05_CSS-Positioning/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * In this activity, we need to use absolute and relative positioning to reposition `box 2` in each of the squares.

  * To start, we look at the dimensions of `square 1` and `square 2`, which have a class of `container`. The height is 600px, and the width is 600px:

    ```css
    .container {
      width: 600px;
      height: 600px;
      margin: 20px auto;
      border: 15px solid black;
    }
    ```

  * We can fit three boxes vertically in the square, so we can deduce that the dimensions of the boxes are 200px. This information will be useful in deciding how much to offset the box so that it is positioned in the middle.

  * 🔑  To position `box 2` in the middle of `square 1`, we will need to set the position of `relative-box-2` to `relative`. Then we offset it from its original position, 200px to the left&mdash;moving the box to the center of the square:

    ```css
    #relative-box-2 {
      position: relative;
      left: 200px;
    }
    ```

  * To use absolute positioning, we first need to set the parent element to `relative`. Therefore, `square 2` has an additional class of `absolute-container`:

    ```css
    .absolute-container {
      position: relative;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑  Then, to move `box 2` outside of `square 2`, we set the position of `absolute-box-2` to `absolute`, and we set the top to 0 and the left to 700px:

    ```css
    #absolute-box-2 {
      position: absolute;
      top: 0;
      left: 700px;
    }
    ```

* If time allows, explain the other CSS using the comments provided.

* Open `05_CSS-Positioning/Solved/index.html` in your browser and explain the following:

  * When we open the webpage, we see that the acceptance criteria has been met and the webpage matches the mockup.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What is the difference between absolute and relative positioning?

  * 🙋 Relative positioning offsets an image relative to its original position but does not change the layout of the other elements around it. Absolute positioning positions the image relative to its parent container and removes it from the flow, changing the layout of other elements around it.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on position](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position), and stay for office hours to ask for help.


* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 12. Recap & Promote Resources (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What do you think you absolutely need to know to succeed at the challenge?

  * 🙋 To succeed at the challenge, we need to know how to add CSS to our HTML by linking stylesheets via relative paths, how to position HTML elements with floats, and how to deploy our projects to GitHub Pages.

  * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

  * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it is not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful.

  * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material prior to class as possible?

  * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

* Direct students to the additional resources available to them:

  * Reflection and Retrieval

  * Career Connection

  * Dessert Menu

### 13. Introduce Upcoming Challenge (5 min)

* As students start working on their weekly Challenges, they will need to create good professional READMEs for every Challenge they complete.

* Go over the [Professional README Guide](../../01-Class-Content/01-HTML-Git-CSS/04-Supplemental/professional-readme-guide/README.md) before they get started on their first Challenge.
