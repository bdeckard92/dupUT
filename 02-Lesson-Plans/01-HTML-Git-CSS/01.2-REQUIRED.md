# Module 01 Virtual Class: HTML, CSS, and Git

## Overview

In today's virtual class, students will review CSS Selectors, the box model, and CSS Positioning.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Select an HTML element to style using CSS selectors.

* Determine how an element is positioned in an HTML document using the CSS position property.

* Identify the box model and its role in web design and layout.

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try and anticipate questions students may have.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* In today's class, you will introduce and demonstrate the module Challenge. Find time prior to class to install dependencies, read the acceptance criteria, and familiarize yourself with the application functionality so you are prepared to answer any questions.

* If you are unfamiliar with GitHub Pages, you will want to perform a dry run of a deployment prior to class.  Consult the [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) documentation for instructions. If you are already using GitHub Pages for a Personal site, you will either need to demo a Project page or create a dummy GitHub account.

* Students learned how to use CSS, the box model, and positioning in lesson 2. A more advanced discussion of CSS Selectors, the box model and positioning is found in Lesson 3.

## Office Hours

Use Office Hours to assist students in troubleshooting installations and configurations of their development tools.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What did you learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

  * 🙋 We learned about the basics of HTML and CSS. We also started to learn about Git for version control. We are moving fast compared to traditional learners. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

  * ☝️ Did anyone have an "Aha!" or "Eureka!" moment this week? When was it and why did things suddenly click for you?

  * 🙋 Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we're thinking about it.

  * ☝️ Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

  * 🙋 It's easy to get stuck when you're learning web development. It's important to learn how to get unstuck because it happens to the pros too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the tool's official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups are great because explaining your problems to someone else often reveals the solution.

### 2. Instructor Do: Introduce Module Challenge (5 min)

* Open `01-Class-Content/01-HTML-Git-CSS/02-Challenge/Main/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * The challenge is a landing page for a marketing agency. It features a navbar, three sections and a sidebar.

  * When we click a link in the navigation, the window scrolls to the corresponding section.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What recently acquired skills will help us build this challenge?

  * 🙋 HTML and CSS!

  * ☝️ How are these skills relevant to a career in web development?

  * 🙋 HTML and CSS are two of the three fundamental pillars of web development.

  * ☝️ How will this challenge improve your portfolio?

  * 🙋 This challenge is a first step towards building our own portfolios.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 3. Instructor Demo: CSS Selectors (5 min) {TODO: Add Code snippet}

  * So far, we have focused on using `class` and `id` to select and style HTML elements. Alternatively, we can use a range of selectors to style the webpage&mdash;for an identical result in the browser.

  * Open `03-CSS-Selectors/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

    * We use a **universal selector** to apply a style to all the elements on a page:

    * We can also select by the element's tag name, which will apply the styles to all the elements with that name and any elements nested in that element. This approach allows us to apply the same font size to all the paragraphs or determine a uniform height and width for all sections:

    * We have already been using **class selectors**! Class selectors select all the elements that have that class attribute attached:

    * We have also been using **id selectors**. Id selectors apply a style to a single element:

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We used CSS Selectors in lesson 2. Although selectors do not change how the styles display on the page, we can choose selectors with a purpose in mind. If we want to style all the elements, we can use a universal selector. If we want to style only one specific element, we might choose an id selector.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  * 🙋 This activity requires us to use an external stylesheet and CSS selectors. Both are needed to understand the challenge. 

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We would start by examining the HTML elements in our `index.html` file and filling in the content with our own information. Then we would create a `style.css` file to add style and position elements.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: CSS Selectors (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

 ```md
  # 📐 Add Comments to Implementation of CSS Selectors

  Work with a partner to add comments describing the functionality of the code found in [Unsolved](./Unsolved/assets/css/style.css).

  ## 📝 Notes

  Refer to the documentation: 

  [MDN Web Docs on HTML elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)

  [MDN Web Docs on attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Attribute)

  [MDN Web Docs on CSS selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors)

  ---

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What are pseudo-class selectors? 

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 17. Instructor Review: CSS Selectors (15 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with selectors? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ Universal selectors

  * ✔️ Element selectors

  * ✔️ Class selectors

  * ✔️ Id selectors

* Open `03-CSS-Selectors/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * For this activity, you were asked to provide comments on existing code, allowing you to solidify your understanding and practice explaining code in plain language.

  * 🔑 For this code snippet, you might write a comment that explains that because this is a universal selector, the font family will be applied to all the elements on the page:

    ```css
    * {
      font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode", "Lucida Grande", sans-serif;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 This element selector applies a background color to the body element:

    ```css
    body {
      background-color: lemonchiffon;
    }
    ```

  * This rule block looks different because there are two selectors. When rule blocks have more than one selector, the styling will apply to all the elements of both selectors. (If code looks unfamiliar, it is a good opportunity to check the documentation.)

    ```css
    header,
    footer {
      width: 100%;
      height: 100px;
      line-height: 100px;
      color: #f0ead6;
      background-color: #191970;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 We use a class selector to select all the HTML elements with that class attribute. To specify that the selector is a class selector, we place a `.` in front of the name in the CSS:

    ```css
    .highlighted-text {
      font-weight: bolder;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 We use an id selector to select a single element. The style will be applied to that element alone:

    ```css
    #contact-section {
      background-color: #f0ead6;
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How do selectors help us style code?

  * 🙋 Selectors define the elements to which a set of CSS rules apply. Universal selectors will apply styles to all the elements on the page, while id selectors will style on a single element. We pick the selectors based on the specificity required.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on CSS selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Relative Paths (5 min)

* Open `04-Relative-Paths/Unsolved/public/index.html` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * This is the portfolio we styled in the previous activity. 

  * 🔑 We link our stylesheet using a **relative path**. 

  ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./assets/style.css" />
  ```

  * 🔑 We refer to it as a relative path because the location of our `style.css` file is linked _relative_ to the location of our `index.html`. An absolute path, on the other hand, would look something like the following: 

  ```html
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      type="text/css"
      href="/home/username/apps/fullstack-online/01-Class-Content/01-HTML-Git-CSS/01-Activities/04-Stu_Relative-Paths/Unsolved/RelativePaths_WorkingExample/assets/style.css"
    />  
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why do we want to use relative paths rather than absolute paths?

  * 🙋 An absolute path points to the location of a file on a specific computer. In this example, `index.html` is on the laptop belonging to user `username`. Relative paths allow us to link files on _any_ computer.

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We were introduced to absolute paths in lesson 2 when contrasted with relative paths.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  * 🙋 We will need to create one or more CSS files in addition to our `index.html` file. We need to ensure they are linked by their relative path to render correctly through GitHub Pages.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Relative Paths (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Relative-Paths/README.md`.

```md
# Relative Paths

In this activity, you will correctly link the various `style.css` files using relative paths.

## Instructions

* Open the `index.html` file and notice the `<head>` section with the links to the CSS stylesheets.

* Correctly link the three `style.css` files found in the `public` directory to the `index.html` file to ensure the HTML file renders according to the following image:

  ![A portfolio with a dark gray header with the student's name, a photo, text on the left and contact info in an unordered list on the right](html-css-mockup.png)

  * Do not move any of the files! You only need to add the relative paths in the `<link>` tags.
```

### 8. Instructor Review: Relative Paths (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ Relative paths

* Open `04-Relative-Paths/Solved/public/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * Our first stylesheet is outside the parent directory of our HTML file. If we want to link to a file that is in a parent directory, we use two dots, rather than one. 

  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../style.css">
  ```

  * 🔑 One of the stylesheets is in the same directory as our HTML file, so we simply add the name and extension of our file to the `<link>` tag.

  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./style.css">
  ```

  * 🔑 Another stylesheet is in an `assets` folder, which is in the same directory as our HTML file. We need to declare the relative path to our stylesheet.

  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./assets/style.css">
  ```

  * 🔑 The last stylesheet is in a `style` directory inside our `assets` directory.

  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="assets/style/style.css">
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What does one dot, `.`, represent?

  * 🙋 One dot represents the current directory.

  * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to the lessons, read the [MDN Web Docs on Dealing with files](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Dealing_with_files), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Instructor Demo: GitHub Pages Personal (5 min)

* Navigate to [GitHub.com](http://github.com) and demonstrate the following: 

  * 🔑 If we want to deploy to GitHub Pages, we need to create a new repository that follows a specific naming schema:

    ```
    <your-GitHub-username>.github.io
    ```

  * We then need to clone our repository and change into the local directory. 

  * GitHub pages expects to find an `index.html`, so we create `index.html` and add boilerplate HTML.

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  </body>
  </html>
  ```

  * We then need to perform the standard Git workflow and `git add`, `git commit` and `git push` the `index.html` to our remote. GitHub will automatically detect the `index.html` file when using `<your-GitHub-username>.github.io` and deploy it for you. 

* Navigate to `http://<your-GitHub-username>.github.io` to demonstrate the following: 

  * Our `index.html` file is now live!

  * 🔑 If we are receiving an error or a blank page, we may need to wait a few minutes for the GitHub servers to update. 
  
  * We may also need to specify the path to `index.html` in the browser, for example: `http://<your-GitHub-username>.github.io/index.html`. 
  
  * If we need to further troubleshoot our deployment, we navigate to the Setttings of our repository, and ensure Pages is enabled and the branch is set to `main`. 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We learned how to deploy the Run Buddy website in lesson 6.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  * 🙋 A functional, _deployed_ application is a requirement of every challenge, along with a professional README following the [Professional README Guide](../../01-Class-Content/01-HTML-Git-CSS/04-Supplemental/professional-readme-guide/README.md).

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 10. Student Do: GitHub Pages Personal (20 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `05-Github-Pages-Personal/README.md`.

```md
# GitHub Pages Personal

In this activity, you will publish your own Personal site using GitHub Pages.

## Instructions

1. Create a new repo that is named `<<YOUR USERNAME>>.github.io` where `<<YOUR USERNAME>>` is your GitHub username. 

  * Double check that you use your exact username. (For example, `janedoe.github.io` would be the GitHub pages repo name for the GitHub user `janedoe`)

2. Clone your repository into your work directory.

3. Add an HTML file named `index.html` and code out a basic webpage.

4. Add, commit, and push your changes into the repository.

5. Navigate to `<<YOUR_USERNAME>>.github.io` and you will find that your new web page has gone live! (again, where <<YOUR USERNAME>> is your GitHub username.)

## Hint(s)

If you need help, consult the [GitHub Pages documentation](https://pages.github.com/).
```

### 11. Instructor Review: GitHub Pages Personal (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ Creating a repository for GitHub Personal Pages

  * ✔️ Deploying a simple 'portfolio' to GitHub Pages

* Delete your `<<YOUR_USERNAME>>.github.io` repository and repeat the process above if necessary. Or use this time to help students who are struggling to deploy their Github page.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why does our file need to be named `index.html`? 

  * 🙋 `index.html` is the default file a server expects to find. The GitHub Pages servers require us to use `index.html`, but if we were to configure our own server, we could specify a different name for the landing page.

  * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to the lessons, read the [GitHub Page documentation](https://pages.github.com/), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 12. Recap & Promote Resources (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What do you think you absolutely need to know to succeed at the challenge?

  * 🙋 To succeed at the challenge, we need to know how to add CSS to our HTML by linking stylesheets via relative paths, how to position HTML elements with floats, and how to deploy our projects to GitHub Pages.

  * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

  * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it is not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful.

  * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material prior to class as possible?

  * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

* Direct students to the additional resources available to them:

  * Reflection and Retrieval

  * Career Connection

  * Dessert Menu

### 13. Introduce Upcoming Challenge (5 min)

* As students start working on their weekly Challenges, they will need to create good professional READMEs for every Challenge they complete.

* Go over the [Professional README Guide](../../01-Class-Content/01-HTML-Git-CSS/04-Supplemental/professional-readme-guide/README.md) before they get started on their first Challenge.
