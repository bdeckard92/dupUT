# Module 01 Virtual Class (Required): HTML, CSS, and Git

## Overview

In today's required virtual class, students will review CSS, relative paths, and deploying to GitHub Personal Pages.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Use CSS to style and layout a simple HTML portfolio

* Implement relative paths to connect files between directories

* Deploy a project using GitHub Personal Pages

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try and anticipate questions students may have.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* In today's class, you will introduce and demonstrate the module Challenge. Find time prior to class to install dependencies, read the acceptance criteria, and familiarize yourself with the application functionality so you are prepared to answer any questions.

* The solution to the first activity requires floats. Students will likely struggle finding it. If it's been awhile, you may want to refresh your knowledge on floats in order to improvise demos and field any questions.

* If you are unfamiliar with GitHub Pages, you will want to perform a dry run of a deployment prior to class.  Consult the [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) documentation for instructions. If you are already using GitHub Pages for a Personal site, you will either need to demo a Project page or create a dummy GitHub account.

* Students learned how to use CSS and relative paths in lesson 2 and deployment to GitHub pages in lesson 6.

## Office Hours

Use Office Hours to assist students in troubleshooting installations and configurations of their development tools.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What did you learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

  * üôã We learned about the basics of HTML and CSS. We also started to learn about git for version control. We are moving fast compared to traditional learners. It‚Äôs okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don‚Äôt give up.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Did anyone have an "Aha!" or "Eureka!" moment this week? When was it and why did things suddenly click for you?

  * üôã Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we're thinking about it.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

  * üôã It's easy to get stuck when you're learning web development. It's important to learn how to get unstuck because it happens to the pros too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the tool's official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups are great because explaining your problems to someone else often reveals the solution.

### 2. Instructor Do: Introduce Module Challenge (5 min)

* Open `01-Class-Content/01-HTML-Git-CSS/02-Challenge/Main/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * The challenge is a landing page for a marketing agency. It features a navbar, three sections and a sidebar.

  * When we click a link in the navigation, the window scrolls to the corresponding section.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What recently acquired skills will help us build this challenge?

  * üôã HTML and CSS!

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How are these skills relevant to a career in web development?

  * üôã HTML and CSS are two of the three fundamental pillars of web development.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How will this challenge improve your portfolio?

  * üôã This challenge is a first step towards building our own portfolios.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 3. Instructor Demo: HTML + CSS (5 min)

* Open `03-HTML-CSS/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë This is a simple portfolio built using HTML and CSS. It follows accessible standards by using only one top-level section heading and two second-level headings. We also see it features an image, using a placeholder. We can update this with our own. The portfolio uses an unordered list in the contact section to display important information. We use anchor tags to create links for email, and GitHub and LinkedIn profiles.

  * üîë The portfolio uses CSS for "style" and to position the contact section.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Where have we used this before?

  * üôã We used CSS positioning in lesson 3 to position the form in the hero section. We were also introduced to HTML elements in lesson 1 and used HTML elements to start building the header and footer in lesson 2.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  * üôã This activity requires us to use HTML and CSS to build a static site.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?

  * üôã We would start by examining the HTML elements in our `index.html` file and filling in the content with our own information. Then we would create a `style.css` file to add style and position elements.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: HTML + CSS (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `03-HTML-CSS/README.md`.

```md
# HTML + CSS

In this activity, you will use CSS to add style to the portfolio.

## Instructions

* Open the `index.html` file and examine the HTML elements.

  * Replace the content with your own information to make this portfolio your own!

* Create a CSS stylesheet and name it `style.css`.

  * Using CSS, style the page and position the elements according to the design in the following image:

  ![A portfolio with a dark gray header with the student's name, a photo, text on the left and contact info in an unordered list on the right](html-css-mockup.png)
```

### 5. Instructor Review: HTML + CSS (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Linking an external stylesheet

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Positioning elements with CSS float

* Open `03-HTML-CSS/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * üîë Notice, we used the `<link>` tag in the `<head>` of our document to _link_ our stylesheet.

  ```html
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>HTML + CSS</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./style.css" />
  </head>
  ```

  * The body of our document is very similar to the activity from the Recommended Class. We filled in the content with our own information.

  ```html
  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>Student Bio</h1>
    </header>

    <div class="container">
      <section id="main-bio">
        <h2>My Name</h2>

        <img
          id="bio-image"
          src="https://placehold.it/200x200"
          alt="My Name"
        />

        <p>
          I am a full-stack web developer!
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="contact-info">
        <h2>Contact Info</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="#">myemail@gmail.com</a></li>
          <li><strong>Github:</strong> <a href="#">my Github username</a></li>
          <li><strong>LinkedIn:</strong> <a href="#">my LinkedIn profile</a></li>
        </ul>
      </section>
    </div>
  </body>
  ```

  * Note that we add a `container` class to our `<div>` and ids to each of our sections, `main-bio` and `contact-info`. 

* Open `03-HTML-CSS/Solved/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * Our `container` class declaration constrains the width of the `<div>` to which it is applied to 1024px. We center the `<div>` using the `margin` property and set its values to 0 and `auto`. 

  ```css
  .container {
    width: 1024px;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }
  ```

  * This is referred to as a **shorthand property**. The first value, 0, represents the vertical (top and bottom) values, the second, `auto`, represents the horizontal (left and right) values. It is the same as writing out, `margin: 0 auto 0 auto`.

  * üîë We float the elements with the `#main-bio`, the `#contact-info`, and the `bio-image` using the `left` value.

  ```css
  #main-bio,
  #contact-info,
  #bio-image {
    float: left;
  }

  #main-bio {
    width: 70%;
  }

  #contact-info {
    width: 30%;
  }
  ```

  * The other styling can be different from what is shown, which is fine!

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why do we give our `#main-bio` and `#contact-info` sections width percentages of 70 and 30?

  * üôã In order to get our `#main-bio` and `#contact-info` sections side-by-side, we assign the elements `width` properties with percentage values that total 100.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to the lessons, read the [MDN Web Docs on float](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/float), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Relative Paths (5 min)

* Open `04-Relative-Paths/Unsolved/public/index.html` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * This is the portfolio we styled in the previous activity. 

  * üîë We link our stylesheet using a **relative path**. 

  ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./assets/style.css" />
  ```

  * üîë We refer to it as a relative path because the location of our `style.css` file is linked _relative_ to the location of our `index.html`. An absolute path, on the other hand, would look something like the following: 

  ```html
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      type="text/css"
      href="/home/username/apps/fullstack-online/01-Class-Content/01-HTML-Git-CSS/01-Activities/04-Stu_Relative-Paths/Unsolved/RelativePaths_WorkingExample/assets/style.css"
    />  
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why do we want to use relative paths rather than absolute paths?

  * üôã An absolute path points to the location of a file on a specific computer. In this example, `index.html` is on the laptop belonging to user `username`. Relative paths allow us to link files on _any_ computer.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Where have we used this before?

  * üôã We were introduced to absolute paths in lesson 2 when contrasted with relative paths.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  * üôã We will need to create one or more CSS files in addition to our `index.html` file. We need to ensure they are linked by their relative path to render correctly through GitHub Pages.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Relative Paths (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Relative-Paths/README.md`.

```md
# Relative Paths

In this activity, you will correctly link the various `style.css` files using relative paths.

## Instructions

* Open the `index.html` file and notice the `<head>` section with the links to the CSS stylesheets.

* Correctly link the three `style.css` files found in the `public` directory to the `index.html` file to ensure the HTML file renders according to the following image:

  ![A portfolio with a dark gray header with the student's name, a photo, text on the left and contact info in an unordered list on the right](html-css-mockup.png)

  * Do not move any of the files! You only need to add the relative paths in the `<link>` tags.
```

### 8. Instructor Review: Relative Paths (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Relative paths

* Open `04-Relative-Paths/Solved/public/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * Our first stylesheet is outside the parent directory of our HTML file. If we want to link to a file that is in a parent directory, we use two dots, rather than one. 

  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../style.css">
  ```

  * üîë One of the stylesheets is in the same directory as our HTML file, so we simply add the name and extension of our file to the `<link>` tag.

  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./style.css">
  ```

  * üîë Another stylesheet is in an `assets` folder, which is in the same directory as our HTML file. We need to declare the relative path to our stylesheet.

  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./assets/style.css">
  ```

  * üîë The last stylesheet is in a `style` directory inside our `assets` directory.

  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="assets/style/style.css">
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What does one dot, `.`, represent?

  * üôã One dot represents the current directory.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to the lessons, read the [MDN Web Docs on Dealing with files](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Dealing_with_files), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Instructor Demo: GitHub Pages Personal (5 min)

* Navigate to [GitHub.com](http://github.com) and demonstrate the following: 

  * üîë If we want to deploy to GitHub Pages, we need to create a new repository that follows a specific naming schema:

    ```
    <your-GitHub-username>.github.io
    ```

  * We then need to clone our repository and change into the local directory. 

  * GitHub pages expects to find an `index.html`, so we create `index.html` and add boilerplate HTML.

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  </body>
  </html>
  ```

  * We then need to perform the standard Git workflow and `git add`, `git commit` and `git push` the `index.html` to our remote. GitHub will automatically detect the `index.html` file when using `<your-GitHub-username>.github.io` and deploy it for you. 

* Navigate to `http://<your-GitHub-username>.github.io` to demonstrate the following: 

  * Our `index.html` file is now live!

  * üîë If we are receiving an error or a blank page, we may need to wait a few minutes for the GitHub servers to update. 
  
  * We may also need to specify the path to `index.html` in the browser, for example: `http://<your-GitHub-username>.github.io/index.html`. 
  
  * If we need to further troubleshoot our deployment, we navigate to the Setttings of our repository, and ensure Pages is enabled and the branch is set to `main`. 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Where have we used this before?

  * üôã We learned how to deploy the Run Buddy website in lesson 6.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  * üôã A functional, _deployed_ application is a requirement of every challenge, along with a professional README following the [Professional README Guide](../../01-Class-Content/01-HTML-Git-CSS/04-Supplemental/professional-readme-guide/README.md).

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 10. Student Do: GitHub Pages Personal (20 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `05-Github-Pages-Personal/README.md`.

```md
# GitHub Pages Personal

In this activity, you will publish your own Personal site using GitHub Pages.

## Instructions

1. Create a new repo that is named `<<YOUR USERNAME>>.github.io` where `<<YOUR USERNAME>>` is your GitHub username. 

  * Double check that you use your exact username. (For example, `janedoe.github.io` would be the GitHub pages repo name for the GitHub user `janedoe`)

2. Clone your repository into your work directory.

3. Add an HTML file named `index.html` and code out a basic webpage.

4. Add, commit, and push your changes into the repository.

5. Navigate to `<<YOUR_USERNAME>>.github.io` and you will find that your new web page has gone live! (again, where <<YOUR USERNAME>> is your GitHub username.)

## Hint(s)

If you need help, consult the [GitHub Pages documentation](https://pages.github.com/).
```

### 11. Instructor Review: GitHub Pages Personal (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Creating a repository for GitHub Personal Pages

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Deploying a simple 'portfolio' to GitHub Pages

* Delete your `<<YOUR_USERNAME>>.github.io` repository and repeat the process above if necessary. Or use this time to help students who are struggling to deploy their Github page.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why does our file need to be named `index.html`? 

  * üôã `index.html` is the default file a server expects to find. The GitHub Pages servers require us to use `index.html`, but if we were to configure our own server, we could specify a different name for the landing page.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to the lessons, read the [GitHub Page documentation](https://pages.github.com/), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 12. Recap & Promote Resources (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What do you think you absolutely need to know to succeed at the challenge?

  * üôã To succeed at the challenge, we need to know how to add CSS to our HTML by linking stylesheets via relative paths, how to position HTML elements with floats, and how to deploy our projects to GitHub Pages.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

  * üôã All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it is not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material prior to class as possible?

  * üôã It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

* Direct students to the additional resources available to them:

  * Reflection and Retrieval

  * Career Connection

  * Dessert Menu

### 13. Introduce Upcoming Challenge (5 min)

* As students start working on their weekly Challenges, they will need to create good professional READMEs for every Challenge they complete.

* Go over the [Professional README Guide](../../01-Class-Content/01-HTML-Git-CSS/04-Supplemental/professional-readme-guide/README.md) before they get started on their first Challenge.

### 14. Office Hours (30 min)

* Announce Office Hours and encourage students to stay on the Zoom and start the challenge while they have live support from instructional staff.

### 15. End
