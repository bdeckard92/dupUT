# Module 01 Virtual Class (Recommended): Git and HTML

## Overview

In today's recommended virtual class, students will review the importance of Git and GitHub for both workflow and professional development. Students will also review command-line basics and HTML.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Explain what it takes to become employer-ready

* Explain the importance of Git and GitHub

* Create and remove files and folders from the command line

* Create a simple portfolio using only HTML

## Instructor Notes

* This is your first virtual class! Congratulations! Be yourself and make it fun. If you're having a good time, your students will too. Good luck!

* Students will likely struggle to adapt to the command line. The associated activity may not take the entire time allotted, so use any remainder to demonstrate other commands, such as `cd`, `pwd`, `cat`, etc.

* In today's first activity, Career Connection, you will navigate to the Career Services website and play a short video introducing Career Services. You will want to load this in your browser prior to class. If there is time remaining in the Career Connection activity, use the remainder to discuss your personal experience in gaining employment in the field. Share your GitHub and/or LinkedIn profiles as well as your portfolio if you feel comfortable doing so.

* In Lesson 1 of the asynchronous content, students are introduced to the terminal and how to navigate folders using the command-line interface.

### 3. Instructor Demo: Command Line (5 min)

* Use the prompts and talking points below to demonstrate the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ Creating files and folders from the command line

  * ✔️ Opening and editing files from the command line

  * ✔️ Removing files and folders from the command line

* Run the following commands from the command line and explain the following:

  * 🔑 To create a directory, we use the make directory command, `mkdir`:

  ```sh
  mkdir demo-project
  ```

  * 🔑 To create a file, we use the `touch` command:

  ```sh
  touch README.md
  ```

  * 🔑 To open our `README.md` in VSCode, we use the `code` command:

  ```sh
  code README.md
  ```

  * A good README begins with the title of its project. `# Demo Project` is good enough for this one.

  * 🔑 To copy our `README.md` into our `demo-project` folder, we use the copy command, `cp`:

  ```sh
  cp README.md demo-project/README.md
  ```

  * 🔑 To delete the original `README.md`, we use the remove command, `rm`:

  ```sh
  rm README.md
  ```

  * 🔑 To delete the `demo-project` directory, we also use the `rm` command, but because it's not empty, we need to use the `-r` switch:

  ```sh
  rm -r demo-project
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We learned how to create and remove files and directories from the terminal in lesson 1.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  * 🙋 Many developer tools, such as Git, are primarily used from the command line. Also, working from the command line will speed up our development workflow.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: HTML (5 min)

* Use the prompts and talking points below to demonstrate the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ Headings

  * ✔️ Image

  * ✔️ Paragraph

  * ✔️ Anchors

  * ✔️ Unordered list

* Open `02-HTML/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 This is a simple portfolio built using only HTML. It follows accessible standards by using only one top-level section heading and two second-level headings.

  * 🔑 We also see it features an image, using a placeholder. We can update this with our own.

  * 🔑 There is a paragraph element below the image, where we can write a bit about ourselves.

  * 🔑 The portfolio uses an unordered list in the contact section to display important information.

  * 🙋 This activity is a review of the fundamentals of HTML.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We would start by creating an HTML file, declaring its `DOCTYPE`, then add a head and body elements. Within the head element, we would add a title tag. Within the body element, we would add semantic elements for each of the sections, headings for those sections, image and paragraph elements, and an unordered list containing anchor tags.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: HTML (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-HTML/README.md`.

```md
# HTML

In this activity, you will use HTML to create a simple portfolio. 

## Instructions

* Create an HTML file and name it `index.html`.

* Using HTML, create a simple portfolio similar to the following image:

![A portfolio mockup with a title, student's name, a photo, text, and contact info in an unordered list](html-mockup.png)

  * Add a title to the head element.

  * Use semantic elements for each section.

  * Include a photo of yourself or use <https://placehold.it/200x200> as an image placeholder.

  * Include a short paragraph about yourself or use placeholder text.

  * Include links to an email address, Github profile, and LinkedIn profile in an unordered list.
```

### 8. Instructor Review: HTML (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ DOCTYPE

  * ✔️ HTML, head and body tags

  * ✔️ Title

  * ✔️ Semantic elements

  * ✔️ Headings

  * ✔️ Image

  * ✔️ Paragraph

  * ✔️ Anchors

  * ✔️ Unordered list

* Open `02-HTML/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We first created a new file, `index.html`. On the first line we add the document type declaration:

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  ```

  * 🔑 We next add an `<html>` tag with a language attribute, followed by a `<head>` tag.

  ```html
  <html lang="en-us">
    <head></head>
  </html>
  ```

  * Our closing `</html>` tag is at the bottom of the file, wrapping all of our content.

  * 🔑 Our head contains a `<meta>` tag specifying the character encoding and a `<title>` tag. The text in the title tag will be rendered in the browser tab.

  ```html
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>HTML</title>
  </head>
  ```

  * None of the content in the `<head>` will be rendered in the browser window.

  * 🔑 Below our closing `</head>` tag, we add a `<body>` tag. The first element we create is a `<header>`, containing an `<h1>` with placeholder text for "Your Name".

  ```html
  <body>
    <!-- Site Header -->
    <header>
      <!-- h1: The most important headline -->
      <h1>Your Name</h1>
    </header>
  </body>
  ```

  * 🔑 Below our `<header>`, we add a `<main>` section. Inside the `<main>` section, we add two sections using the `<section>` tag. Our first section contains a second-level heading, an image, and a paragraph containing an anchor.

  ```html
  <main>
    <!-- Section 1: Bio -->
    <section>
      <!-- h2: Tier-2 Headline (Not as important as the h1 header, but more than one allowed). -->
      <h2>Portfolio</h2>

      <!-- Image with link -->
      <img src="https://placehold.it/200x200" alt="Your Name" />

      <!-- Paragraph with embedded link -->
      <p>
        Write a short paragraph or two about yourself, or use
        <a href="http://www.lipsum.com/">Lorem Ipsum</a> placeholder text.
      </p>
    </section>
  ```

  * 🔑 Our second section also contains a second-level heading and an unordered list of anchors.

  ```html
    <!-- Section 2: Contact Info -->
    <section>
      <!-- h2: Tier-2 Headline -->
      <h2>Contact Info</h2>

      <!-- Unordered list -->
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Email:</strong>
          <a href="mailto:someone@somesite.com">someone@somesite.com</a>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Github:</strong> <a href="#">username</a></li>
        <li><strong>LinkedIn:</strong> <a href="#">LinkedIn</a></li>
      </ul>
    </section>
  </main>
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why did we name our HTML file `index.html`?

  * 🙋 `index.html` is the default name a server expects to find in order to _serve_ our HTML.

  * ☝️ Which of these HTML elements are semantic?

  * 🙋 All of them! Every element serves a specific purpose related to the content that it contains.

  * ☝️ What is an example of an HTML element that _is not_ semantic?

  * 🙋 A `<div>` is an example of an HTML element that is not semantic.

  * ☝️ Why did we use `<h2>` elements in our sections?

  * 🙋 For accessibility and SEO purposes, it is considered best practice to only use one `<h1>` and follow heading rank, which means don't skip levels.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [MDN Web Docs for HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 09. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

  * 🙋 Git and GitHub are important tools for developers, not just for workflow, but for making oneself employer-competitive. Command line basics and HTML are two additional fundamental skills for success as a developer.

  * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

  * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful.

  * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

  * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

  * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

  * 🙋 We can learn more about terminal commands and basic HTML elements in lesson 1 and more advanced HTML elements in lesson 2.

  * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

  * 🙋 In the next session, we will review CSS, relative paths, and deployment of our sites using GitHub Personal Pages.

### 10. Office Hours (30 min)

* Announce Office Hours and invite students to stay on the Zoom and start the challenge while they have live support from instructional staff.
