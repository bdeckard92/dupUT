# Module 01 Instructor Overview: HTML, CSS, and Git

Welcome and thank you so much for being a part of our program! Thanks to instructors/TAs like yourself, we're helping thousands of students around the world achieve their professional goals and their creative dreams. You'll have plenty of time to work with these students, and their progress will astound you. Get ready! You're in for a fun ride!

## Overview

In this module, students will learn the foundations of JavaScript. By learning JavaScript, students will develop the skills needed to understand other programming languages. Learning the fundamentals of JavaScript is an investment in their long-term success as a full-stack web developer.

In this week's virtual classes, you will be welcoming our students to their first module of our Full-Stack Web Development Boot Camp. You'll be walking them through the very basics of HTML, CSS, Git Version Control, and Terminal/Console commands.

| Day | Topic          | Location  |
| --- | -------------- | --------- |
| 1   | CLI            | 1.1       |
| 1   | HTML           | 1.1 - 1.7 |
| 2   | CSS            | 1.1 - 1.7 |
| 2   | Relative Paths | 1.2       |
| 2   | GitHub Pages   | 1.1       |

## Overview of Asynchronous Material

Why are students learning HTML, CSS, and Git?

* Git is an essential skill that employers will expect students to have on day one of their new positions. It is important to impart knowledge of the essential Git commands in order to help students save their work and collaborate effectively.
* HTML allows students to scaffold their pages and organize elements on the page. It's important to help students achieve greater understanding of this markup language so that they have a solid foundation for the skills that come later.
* As one of the three fundamental technologies used for web development, CSS is an important skill for students to have in order to style their pages. CSS allows students to organize their code in such a way that style is separate from content.

Throughout the async module this week, students will use HTML, CSS and Git to do the following:

* Identify the difference between HTML and CSS, what each technology does, and how they interact with each other
* Understand semantic HTML and the best practices for structuring HTML files
* Structure HTML elements to satisfy specific accessibility standards that allow tools such as screen readers to explain the page's content in a meaningful way to those who have a disability such as vision or hearing loss
* Follow best practices for structuring CSS files
* Add comments to CSS files to make the code easier to read
* Use GitHub Pages to publish a webpage to the internet

**Reminder**: If students need help with an async activity, encourage them to attend Office Hours for help! If you can’t get through all of it, remind them that they can lean on Learning Assistants with the AskBCS bot for more help.

## Virtual Classes

If your class started AFTER January 1, 2021, use these lesson plans:

* [Virtual Class 01.1](./01.1-REQUIRED.md)

* [Virtual Class 01.2](./01.2-REQUIRED.md)

If your class started BEFORE January 1, 2021, use these lesson plans:

  * Slack
  * Chrome/Firefox
  * Insomnia
  * VS Code
  * `zsh` (Mac)
  * `brew` (Mac)
  * Git Bash (Windows)
  * SSH keys

### Common Pain Points

According to our class data, students might experience some of the following pain points throughout the week:

## Career Connection

During each lesson that students work through, they will also view a Career Connection section that will tie together the academic content with Career Services and how this material will be applicable to them in their future career.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Director and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careerservicesonlineevents.splashthat.com/).

If you'd like more information on Career Services, visit the [Career Services resources page](https://mycareerspot.org/).

## Module Challenge

Students will refactor an existing webpage and make it accessible.

[Module 01 Challenge](../../01-Class-Content/01-HTML-Git-CSS/02-Challenge)

Specific skills students will need to implement in order to be successful:

* DRY design pattern -- Consolidate CSS selectors
* Ensuring all links function properly
* Implementation of semantic structure of HTML elements
* Well documented code -- include comments
* Implementation of `alt` attributes for images
* Ordering elements in sequence

## Heads-Up

Next week, you will review flexbox, CSS Grid, and other advanced CSS topics. If these are new or it's been awhile, be sure to review the activities in advance.

**Important**: As students start working on their weekly Challenges, they will need to create good professional READMEs for every Challenge they complete. Refer them to this [Professional README Guide](../../01-Class-Content/01-HTML-Git-CSS/04-Supplemental/professional-readme-guide/README.md) as they work on their first Challenge.
