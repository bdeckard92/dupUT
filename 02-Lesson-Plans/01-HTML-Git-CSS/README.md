# Module 01 Instructor Overview: HTML, CSS, and Git

Welcome, and thank you so much for being a part of our program! Thanks to instructors and TAs like you, we're helping thousands of students around the world achieve their professional goals and their creative dreams. You'll have plenty of time to work with these students, and their progress will astound you. Get ready! You're in for a fun ride!

## Overview

In this module, students learn three web development technologies that are essential to success as a web developer. Students learn HTML as they create the basic structure for webpages. They also learn CSS so that they can organize and style elements on the page. Finally, students will become familiar with Git and with navigating the file system using the command line.

In this week's virtual classes, you will welcome students to their first module of the Full-Stack Web Development Boot Camp. You'll walk them through the very basics of HTML, CSS, Git version control, and terminal/console commands.

| Day | Topic          | Location  |
| --- | -------------- | --------- |
| 1   | CLI            | 1.1       |
| 1   | HTML           | 1.1 - 1.7 |
| 2   | CSS            | 1.1 - 1.7 |
| 2   | Relative Paths | 1.2       |
| 2   | GitHub Pages   | 1.1       |

## Overview of Asynchronous Material

Why are students learning HTML, CSS, and Git?

* Git is an essential skill that employers will expect students to have on day one of their new positions. It is important to impart knowledge of the essential Git commands to help students save their work and collaborate effectively.

* HTML allows students to scaffold pages so that they can display content to the end user. It's important to help students achieve greater understanding of this markup language so that they have a solid foundation for the skills that come later.

* As one of the three fundamental technologies used for web development, CSS is an important skill for students to have to style content on the page. CSS allows students to organize their code so that style is separate from content.

Throughout the async module this week, students will use HTML, CSS, and Git to do the following:

* Identify the difference between HTML and CSS, what each technology does, and how they interact with each other.

* Learn semantic HTML and the best practices for structuring HTML files.

* Structure HTML elements to satisfy specific accessibility standards that allow tools such as screen readers to explain the page's content in a meaningful way to those who have a disability like impaired vision or hearing loss.

* Follow best practices for structuring CSS files.

* Add comments to CSS files to make the code easier to read.

* Publish a webpage to the internet using GitHub Pages.

**Reminder**: If students need help with an async activity, encourage them to attend Office Hours for help! If you can’t get through all of it, remind them that they can lean on Learning Assistants with the AskBCS bot for more help.

* [Virtual Class 01.2](./01.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* Review with students the difference between a Module Project and a Challenge. A Challenge can be thought of as homework, while the Module Project is asynchronous material in Canvas. While the Module Project is not required, students are advised to be familiar with the material before attending class.

* Students will likely struggle to get all of their development tools installed and configured. Use Office Hours to assist students in troubleshooting installations and configurations. The following tools take top priority for success in this module:

  * Slack

  * Chrome/Firefox
  
  * Insomnia
  
  * VS Code
  
  * `zsh` (macOS)
  
  * `brew` (macOS)
  
  * Git Bash (Windows)
  
  * SSH keys

### Common Pain Points

According to our class data, students might experience some of the following pain points throughout the week:

| Pain Point        | Recommendation                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SSH Keys          | Refer students to [Generating a new SSH key](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent). |
| Account Setup     | Refer students to [GitHub](https://github.com) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/).                                                                                 |
| Out of class help | Explain how to contact Learning Assistants in Slack, Office Hour times, tutors, classmates. Encourage study groups.                                              |

## Career Connection

During each lesson that students work through, they will also view a Career Connection section that will tie together the academic content with Career Services and how this material will be applicable to them in their future career.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Director and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careerservicesonlineevents.splashthat.com/).

If you'd like more information on Career Services, visit the [Career Services resources page](https://mycareerspot.org/).

## Module Challenge

Students will refactor an existing webpage that currently falls short of acceptable accessibility standards for web development. Students will make the page easier to access by implementing a semantic structure of HTML elements and adding `alt` attributes to images. These changes will improve SEO and allow technologies like screen readers to properly understand the layout of the page.

[Module 01 Challenge](../../01-Class-Content/01-HTML-Git-CSS/02-Challenge)

Specific skills that students will need to implement in order to be successful:

* DRY design pattern -- consolidating CSS selectors

* Ensuring that all links function properly

* Implementation of semantic structure of HTML elements

* Well-documented code -- including comments

* Implementation of `alt` attributes for images

* Ordering elements in sequence

## Heads-Up

Next week, you will review flexbox, CSS Grid, and other advanced CSS topics. If these are new to you or it's been a while, be sure to review the activities in advance.

**Important**: As students start working on their weekly Challenges, they will need to create professional READMEs for every Challenge they complete. Refer them to this [Professional README Guide](../../01-Class-Content/01-HTML-Git-CSS/04-Supplemental/professional-readme-guide/README.md) as they work on their first Challenge.
