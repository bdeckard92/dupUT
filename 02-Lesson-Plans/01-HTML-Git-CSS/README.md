# Module 01 Instructor Overview: HTML, CSS, and Git

Welcome and thank you so much for being a part of our program! Thanks to instructors/TAs like yourself, we're helping thousands of students around the world achieve their professional goals and their creative dreams. You'll have plenty of time to work with these students, and their progress will astound you. Buckle in! You're in for a fun ride!

## Overview

In this week's virtual classes, you'll introduce students to the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, GitHub, and the command line.

## Virtual Classes

[Recommended](./01.1-RECOMMENDED.md)

[Required](./01.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* Students will likely struggle to get all of their development tools installed and configured. Use Office Hours to assist students in troubleshooting installations and configurations. The following tools take top priority for success in this module:

  * Slack

  * Chrome

  * VS Code (including the Open in Browser extension)

  * Git

  * Terminal emulator (Git BASH for Windows)

  * SSH keys, added to both GitHub and the class repository

* Students often encounter errors while configuring their SSH keys. The prework directs students to the [Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) article on GitHub. Many students simply forget to add their newly generated key to the ssh-agent. The others will most likely need to be regenerated.

* Students will also need the following accounts:

  * GitHub (for their work)

  * GitLab (for the class repo)

## Heads-Up

* Next week, you will review flexbox, CSS Grid, and other advanced CSS topics. If these are new or it's been awhile, be sure to review the activities in advance.

* As students start working on their weekly Challenges, they will need to create good professional READMEs for every Challenge they complete. Refer them to this [Professional README Guide](../../01-Class-Content/01-HTML-Git-CSS/04-Supplemental/professional-readme-guide/README.md) as they work on their first Challenge.
