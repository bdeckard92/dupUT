## Instructor Notes

* Students will likely struggle getting all of their development tools installed and configured. Use Office Hours to assist students in troubleshooting installations and configurations. The following are priority for success in this module:

  * Slack

  * Chrome

  * VSCode

  * Terminal emulator (Git BASH for Windows)

  * SSH keys, added to both GitHub and the class repository

* Students often encounter errors configuring their SSH keys. The pre-work directs students to the [Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) article on GitHub. Many students simply forget to add their newly generated key to the ssh-agent. The others will most likely need to be regenerated.
