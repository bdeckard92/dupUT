# Module 01 Instructor Overview: HTML-Git-CSS

Welcome and thank you so much for being a part of our program! Thanks to instructors/TAs like yourself, we're helping hundreds of students across the world achieve their career goals and their creative dreams. You have plenty of time to work with these students, and their progress will astound you. Buckle in! You're in for a fun ride!

## Overview

In this weeks virtual classes, you'll introduce students to the basics of HTML, CSS, Git and GitHub, and the command line.

## Virtual Classes

[Recommended](./01.1-RECOMMENDED.md)

[Required](./01.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* Students will likely struggle getting all of their development tools installed and configured. Use Office Hours to assist students in troubleshooting installations and configurations. The following are priority for success in this module:

  * Slack

  * Chrome

  * VSCode (incl. Open in Browser extension)

  * Git

  * Terminal emulator (Git BASH for Windows)

  * SSH keys, added to both GitHub and the class repository

* Students often encounter errors configuring their SSH keys. The pre-work directs students to the [Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) article on GitHub. Many students simply forget to add their newly generated key to the ssh-agent. The others will most likely need to be regenerated.

Students will also need the following accounts:

* GitHub (for _their_ work)

* GitLab (for the class repo)
