# Module 01 Instructor Overview: HTML, CSS, and Git

Welcome, and thank you so much for being a part of our program! Thanks to instructors and TAs like you, we're helping thousands of students around the world achieve their professional goals and creative dreams. You'll have plenty of time to work with these students, and their progress will astound you. Get ready! You're in for a fun ride!

## Overview

In this module, students learn three web development technologies that are essential to their success as a web developer. Students learn HTML as they create the basic structure for webpages. They learn CSS so that they can organize and style elements on the page. Finally, they learn how ot use Git and navigate the file system using the command line.

In this week's virtual classes, you will welcome students to the first module of the course. You'll also teach them about the basics of HTML, attributes, CSS selectors, the CSS Box Model, and CSS positioning.

| Day | Topic               | Location  |
| --- | --------------      | --------- |
| 1   | HTML                | 1.1 - 1.7 |
| 1   | Attributes          | 1.2 - 1.7 |
| 2   | CSS Selectors       | 1.1 - 1.7 |
| 2   | Box Model           | 1.3       |
| 2   | CSS Positioning     | 1.3       |

## Overview of Asynchronous Material

This week in the asynchronous content, students are introduced to HTML, CSS, and Git. These skills are important for the following reasons:

* HTML, CSS, and Git are the three fundamental technologies of web development.

* HTML allows students to scaffold webpages so they can display content to the end user. A solid foundation in HTML will help students learn more complex skills later in the course.

* CSS is an important skill to master, as it allows students to style the content on a webpage and organize their code so that style is separate from content.

* Git is an essential skill for developers, and employers will expect new hires to have a firm grasp of it on day one of any new position. Being well-practiced in essential Git commands will allow students to effectively save their work and collaborate effectively.

Throughout the async module this week, students will use HTML, CSS, and Git to do the following:

* Identify the difference between HTML and CSS, what each technology does, and how they interact with each other.

* Learn semantic HTML and the best practices for structuring HTML files.

* Structure HTML elements to satisfy specific accessibility standards that allow tools such as screen readers to explain a webpage's content in a meaningful way to people with disabilities.

* Follow best practices for structuring CSS files.

* Add comments to CSS files to make the code easier to read.

* Publish a webpage to the internet using GitHub Pages.

**Reminder**: If students need help with an async activity, encourage them to attend Office Hours. If they need more help, remind them that they can use Learning Assistants via the AskBCS bot.

The following table contains a description of each lesson's portion of the module project and the corresponding key points that are taught:

| 4 - Build the Two Main Content Sections | Create "What We Do" and "What You Do" sections of Run Buddy.                       | Chrome dev tools, multiple CSS classes                 |
| 5 - Meet the Trainers                   | Create section elements to build out the page.                                    | CSS `float`, CSS classes, specificity in elements      |

| 7 - Add a Privacy Policy                | Add a privacy policy page to the Run Buddy website.                               | Linking multiple CSS files                             |


## Virtual Classes

* [Virtual Class 01.1](./01.1-REQUIRED.md)

* [Virtual Class 01.2](./01.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* Review the difference between a module project and the Challenge. The Challenge can be thought of as homework, whereas the module project is what students build as they work through the asynchronous lessons in Canvas. Even though completion of the module project is not required, students are advised to be familiar with the material before attending class.

* Students will likely struggle to get all of their development tools installed and configured. Use Office Hours to assist students in troubleshooting installations and configurations. The following tools take top priority for success in this module:

  * Slack

  * Chrome/Firefox

  * Insomnia

  * VS Code

  * `zsh` (macOS)

  * `brew` (macOS)

  * Git Bash (Windows)

  * SSH keys

### Common Pain Points

According to our class data, students might experience some of the following pain points throughout the week:

| Pain Point        | Recommendation                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SSH keys          | Refer students to [Generating a New SSH Key](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent). |
| Account setup     | Refer students to [GitHub](https://github.com) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/).                                                                                 |
| Out-of-class help | Explain how to contact Learning Assistants using Slack, the value of Office Hours, and the role of tutors and classmates as sources of support. Encourage study groups.                                              |

## Career Connection

Every lesson contains a Career Connection section that links the academic content with Career Services and students' future career.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Director and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careerservicesonlineevents.splashthat.com/).

If you want to learn more about Career Services, visit the [Career Services resources page](https://mycareerspot.org/).

## Module Challenge

For the [Module 01 Challenge](../../01-Class-Content/01-HTML-Git-CSS/02-Challenge), students will refactor an existing webpage that currently falls short of acceptable accessibility standards for web development. Students will make the page easier to access by implementing a semantic structure of HTML elements and adding `alt` attributes to images. These changes will improve SEO and allow accessibility tools, such as screen readers, to effectively parse and communicate the page's layout and contents.

Students must know how to implement the following skills in order to succeed in this week's Challenge:

* Using the DRY design pattern and consolidating CSS selectors

* Ensuring that all links function properly

* Implementing semantic structure of HTML elements

* Writing well-documented code using comments

* Implementing the `alt` attribute for images

* Ordering elements in sequence

## Heads-Up

Next week, you will review flexbox, CSS Grid, and other advanced CSS topics. If these are new to you or it's been a while since you used them, be sure to review the activities in advance.

**Important**: Students must create a professional README file for every Challenge that they complete. Refer them to this [Professional README Guide](../../01-Class-Content/01-HTML-Git-CSS/04-Supplemental/professional-readme-guide/README.md) and remind them of its importance.
