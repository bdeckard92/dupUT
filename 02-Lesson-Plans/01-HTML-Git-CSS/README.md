## Overview of Asynchronous Material

Why are students learning HTML, CSS, and Git?

* Learning how to use Git is an essential skill that employers will expect you to have on day one of your new position. It is important to know the essential Git commands in order to save your work and collaborate effectively with your team.
* HTML is the backbone to your entire website. It's important to have a solid understanding of this markup language so that you have a solid base for everything that comes after.
* CSS is an important skill to have in order to create amazing looking websites. CSS allows you to be artistic but also keep things organized.

Throughout the async module this week, students will use HTML, CSS and Git to do the following:

* Know the difference between HTML and CSS, what each technology does, and how they interact with each other
* Understand semantic HTML and the best practices for structuring HTML files
* Structure HTML elements to satisfy specific accessibility standards that allow tools such as screen readers to explain the page's content in a meaningful way to those who have a disability such as vision or hearing loss
* Follow best practices for structuring CSS files
* Add comments to CSS files to make the code easier to read
* Use GitHub Pages to publish a webpage to the internet

**Reminder:** If students need help with an async activity, encourage them to attend Office Hours for help! If you can’t get through all of it, remind them that they can lean on Learning Assistants with the AskBCS bot for more help.

## Virtual Classes

If your class started AFTER January 1, 2021, use these lesson plans:

* [Virtual Class 01.1](./01.1-REQUIRED.md)

* [Virtual Class 01.2](./01.2-REQUIRED.md)

If your class started BEFORE January 1, 2021, use these lesson plans:

* [Virtual Class (Recommended) 01.1](./01.1-RECOMMENDED.md)

* [Virtual Class (Required) 01.2](./01.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* Students will likely struggle to get all of their development tools installed and configured. Use Office Hours to assist students in troubleshooting installations and configurations. The following tools take top priority for success in this module:

  * Slack
  * Chrome/Firefox
  * Insomnia
  * VS Code
  * `zsh` (Mac)
  * `brew` (Mac)
  * Git Bash (Windows)
  * SSH keys

### Common Pain Points

According to our class data, students might experience some of the following pain points throughout the week:

| Pain Point        | Recommendation                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SSH Keys          | Refer students to [Generating a new SSH key](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) |
| Needed accounts   | Refer students to [GitHub](https://github.com) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/)                                                                                 |
| Out of class help | Explain how to contact Learning Assistants in Slack, office hour times, tutors, classmates. Encourage study groups.                                              |

## Career Connection

During each lesson that students work through, they will also view a Career Connection section that will tie together the academic content with Career Services and how this material will be applicable to them in their future career.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Director and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careerservicesonlineevents.splashthat.com/).

If you'd like more information on Career Services, visit the [Career Services resources page](https://mycareerspot.org/).

## Module Challenge

Students will build a landing page using HTML and CSS for a company called "Run Buddy"

[Module 01 Challenge](../../01-Class-Content/01-HTML-Git-CSS/02-Challenge)

Specific skills students will need to implement in order to be successful:

* HTML
* CSS
* Git
* `bash` commands
* External Stylesheets
* Relative paths
* GitHub pages

## Heads-Up

* Next week, you will review flexbox, CSS Grid, and other advanced CSS topics. If these are new or it's been awhile, be sure to review the activities in advance.

**IMPORTANT**: As students start working on their weekly Challenges, they will need to create good professional READMEs for every Challenge they complete. Refer them to this [Professional README Guide](../../01-Class-Content/01-HTML-Git-CSS/04-Supplemental/professional-readme-guide/README.md) as they work on their first Challenge.
