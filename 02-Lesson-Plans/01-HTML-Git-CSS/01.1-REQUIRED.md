# Module 01 Virtual Class: HTML, CSS, and Git

## Overview

In today's virtual class, students will review the importance of Git and GitHub for workflow and professional development. Students will also review command-line basics and HTML.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Explain what it takes to become employer-ready

* Explain the importance of Git and GitHub

* Create and remove files and folders from the command line

* Create a simple portfolio using only HTML

## Instructor Notes

* Congratulations&mdash;this is your first virtual class! Be yourself and make it fun. If you're having a good time, your students will too. Good luck!

* It's likely that students will have a hard time adapting to the command line. If the command-line activity ends early, use the remaining time to demonstrate other commands, such as `cd`, `pwd`, and `cat`. Extra practice with the command line will help the students acclimate more quickly.

* In today's first activity, Career Connection, you will navigate to the Career Services website and play a short introduction video. Make sure to load this in your browser before class. If you have extra time, use it to discuss your personal experience with getting a developer job. If you feel comfortable doing so, share your professional portfolio and your GitHub and/or LinkedIn profiles.

* In the asynchronous content, students are introduced to the command line and basic HTML elements in Lesson 1, and more advanced HTML elements in Lesson 2.

### 2. Instructor Do: Student Check-In (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

  * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back at what we've accomplished and acknowledge that it is a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed&mdash;as long as you don’t give up.

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic?

  * 🙋 Let's do Fist to Five together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 3. Instructor Demo: Command Line (5 min)

* Use the prompts and talking points (:key:) below to review the following key points (✔️ ):

  * ✔️ Creating files and folders from the command line

  * ✔️ Opening and editing files from the command line

  * ✔️ Removing files and folders from the command line

* Run and explain the following commands from the command line:

  * 🔑 To create a directory, we use the "make directory" command, `mkdir`:

     ```sh
     mkdir demo-project
     ```

  * 🔑 To create a file, we use the `touch` command:

     ```sh
     touch README.md
     ```

  * 🔑 To open our `README.md` in VS Code, we use the `code` command:

     ```sh
     code README.md
     ```

  * A good README begins with the title of its project. `# Demo Project` is good enough for this one.

  * 🔑 To copy our `README.md` into the `demo-project` folder, we use the copy command, `cp`:

     ```sh
     cp README.md demo-project/README.md
     ```

  * 🔑 To delete the original `README.md`, we use the remove command, `rm`:

     ```sh
     rm README.md
     ```

  * 🔑 To delete the `demo-project` directory, we also use the `rm` command, and because it's not empty, we need to use the `-r` switch:

     ```sh
     rm -r demo-project
     ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We learned how to create and remove files and directories from the command line in Lesson 1.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

  * 🙋 Many developer tools, such as Git, are primarily used from the command line. Also, working from the command line will speed up our development workflow.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

     ```

  * 🔑 To open our `README.md` in VS Code, we use the `code` command:

     ```sh
     code README.md
     ```

  * We type `# My Awesome Project` as the title of this `README.md`.

  * 🔑 To copy our `README.md` into the `my-awesome-project` folder, we use the copy command, `cp`:

     ```sh
     cp README.md demo-project/README.md
     ```

  * 🔑 To delete the original `README.md`, we use the remove command, `rm`:

     ```sh

  * ☝️ How do you move a file or folder?

  * 🙋 To move a file or folder, we use the `mv` command.

  * ☝️ How would you write to a file without opening it?

  * 🙋 We can use the `echo` command to write to a file without opening, like so: `echo "Hello World!" > README.md`

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to the lessons, read the [Git command-line documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-The-Command-Line), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: HTML (5 min)

* Use the prompts and talking points (:key:) below to review the following key points (✔️ ):

  * ✔️ Headings

  * ✔️ Images

  * ✔️ Paragraphs

  * ✔️ Anchors

  * ✔️ Unordered lists

* Open `02-HTML/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 This is a simple portfolio built using only HTML. It adheres to accessibility guidelines by using only one top-level section heading and two second-level headings.

  * 🔑 We can also see that it features an image, using a placeholder. We can update this with our own image.

  * 🔑 There is a paragraph element below the image, where we can write a bit about ourselves.

  * 🔑 The portfolio uses an unordered list in the contact section to display important information.

  * 🔑 We use anchor tags to create links for email, and GitHub and LinkedIn profiles.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * 🙋 This activity is a review of the fundamentals of HTML.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We would start by creating an HTML file, declaring its `DOCTYPE`, then adding a `head` and `body` element. Within the `head` element, we would add a `title` element. Within the `body` element, we would add semantic elements for each of the sections, headings for those sections, image and paragraph elements, and an unordered list that contains anchor tags.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: HTML (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-HTML/README.md`, which are also shown here:

   ```md
   # HTML
   
   In this activity, you will use HTML to create a simple portfolio. 
   
   ## Instructions
   
   * Create an HTML file and name it `index.html`.

   * Using HTML, create a simple portfolio similar to the following image:

   ![A portfolio mockup with a title, student's name, a photo, text, and contact info in an unordered list](html-mockup.png)

  * Add a title to the head element.

  * Use semantic elements for each section.

   * Include a photo of yourself or use <https://placehold.it/200x200> as an image placeholder.

  * Include a short paragraph about yourself or use placeholder text.

  * Include links to an email address, Github profile, and LinkedIn profile in an unordered list.
   ```

### 8. Instructor Review: HTML (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points (:key:) below to review the following key points (✔️ ):

  * ✔️ DOCTYPE

  * ✔️ HTML, head, and body elements

  * ✔️ Title

  * ✔️ Semantic elements

  * ✔️ Headings

  * ✔️ Images

  * ✔️ Paragraphs

  * ✔️ Anchors

  * ✔️ Unordered lists

* Open `02-HTML/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We first created a new file, `index.html`. On the first line, we add the document type declaration:

     ```html
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     ```

  * 🔑 We next add an `<html>` element with a language attribute, followed by a `<head>` element:

     ```html
     <html lang="en-us">
       <head></head>
     </html>
     ```

  * Our closing `</html>` tag is at the bottom of the file, wrapping all of our content.

  * 🔑 Our head contains a `<meta>` tag that specifies the character encoding and a `<title>` element. The text in the `<title>` element will be rendered in the browser tab.

     ```html
     <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8" />
       <title>HTML</title>
     </head>
     ```

  * None of the content in the `<head>` element will be rendered in the browser window.

  * 🔑 Below our closing `</head>` tag, we add a `<body>` tag. The first element we create is a `<header>`, containing an `<h1>` with placeholder text for "Your Name":

     ```html
     <body>
       <!-- Site Header -->
       <header>
         <!-- h1: The most important headline -->
         <h1>Your Name</h1>
       </header>
     </body>
     ```

  * 🔑 Below our `<header>`, we add a `<main>` section. Inside the `<main>` section, we add two sections using the `<section>` tag. Our first section contains a second-level heading, an image, and a paragraph that contains an anchor:

     ```html
     <main>
       <!-- Section 1: Bio -->
       <section>
         <!-- h2: Tier-2 Headline (Not as important as the h1 header, but more than one allowed). -->
         <h2>Portfolio</h2>

         <!-- Image with link -->
         <img src="https://placehold.it/200x200" alt="Your Name" />

         <!-- Paragraph with embedded link -->
         <p>
           Write a short paragraph or two about yourself, or use
           <a href="http://www.lipsum.com/">Lorem Ipsum</a> placeholder text.
         </p>
       </section>
     ```

  * 🔑 Our second section also contains a second-level heading and an unordered list of anchors:

     ```html
       <!-- Section 2: Contact Info -->
       <section>
         <!-- h2: Tier-2 Headline -->
         <h2>Contact Info</h2>

         <!-- Unordered list -->
         <ul>
           <li>
             <strong>Email:</strong>
             <a href="mailto:someone@somesite.com">someone@somesite.com</a>
           </li>
           <li><strong>Github:</strong> <a href="#">username</a></li>
           <li><strong>LinkedIn:</strong> <a href="#">LinkedIn</a></li>
         </ul>
       </section>
     </main>
     ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why did we name our HTML file `index.html`?

  * 🙋 `index.html` is the default name a server expects to find in order to serve our HTML.

  * ☝️ Which of these HTML elements are semantic?

  * 🙋 All of them! Every element serves a specific purpose related to the content that it contains.

  * ☝️ What is an example of an HTML element that __is not__ semantic?

  * 🙋 A `<div>` is an example of an HTML element that is not semantic.

  * ☝️ Why did we use `<h2>` elements in our sections?

  * 🙋 For accessibility and SEO purposes, it is considered best practice to only use one `<h1>` per webpage, and to follow heading rank, which means not skipping heading levels.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [MDN Web Docs on HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

  * 🙋 Git and GitHub are important tools for developers, not just for workflow, but for becoming employer-competitive. Command-line basics and HTML are also fundamental to being a successful developer.

  * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

  * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely.

  * ☝️ Why is it important to complete as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

  * 🙋 It's important for two reasons: to be fully prepared to start the Challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic enough depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will also use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

  * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

  * 🙋 We can learn more about terminal commands and basic HTML elements in Lesson 1 and more advanced HTML elements in Lesson 2.

  * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

  * 🙋 In the next session, we will review CSS, relative paths, and deploying sites using GitHub Personal Pages.

### 10. Office Hours (30 min)

* Announce office hours and invite students to stay on the Zoom and start the Challenge while they have live support from instructional staff.
