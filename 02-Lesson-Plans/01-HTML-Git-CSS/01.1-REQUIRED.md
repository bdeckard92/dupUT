# Module 01 Virtual Class: HTML, CSS, and Git

## Overview

In today's virtual class, students will review the importance of Git and GitHub for workflow and professional development. Students will also review command-line basics and HTML.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Explain what it takes to become employer-ready

* Explain the importance of Git and GitHub

* Create and remove files and folders from the command line

* Create a simple portfolio using only HTML

## Instructor Notes

* Congratulations&mdash;this is your first virtual class! Be yourself and make it fun. If you're having a good time, your students will too. Good luck!

* It's likely that students will have a hard time adapting to the command line. If the command-line activity ends early, use the remaining time to demonstrate other commands, such as `cd`, `pwd`, and `cat`. Extra practice with the command line will help the students acclimate more quickly.

* In today's first activity, Career Connection, you will navigate to the career services website and play a short introduction video. Make sure to load this in your browser before class. If you have extra time, use it to discuss your personal experience with getting a developer job. If you feel comfortable doing so, share your professional portfolio and your GitHub and/or LinkedIn profiles. The first few questions are intended to get students talking, so make sure to manage your time effectively. Only plan to spend about 20&ndash;30 seconds on the first few questions so that you have more time to discuss how to become employer-ready.

* In the asynchronous content, students are introduced to the command line and basic HTML elements in Lesson 1, and more advanced HTML elements in Lesson 2.

* Open the lesson's [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dI5n5w5sXG4fNIKQzkQZcbhji7D1IR1zrurEuNhVyl8/edit?usp=sharing) and walk through the following slides on foundation setting:

  **Big Picture**: This is an opportunity to look at the big picture of where students are in the course. Take a moment to discuss a few real-world examples of why this week's topics are valuable.

  **Boot Camp Pointers**: Review some logistics that will help students stay on track. This is an opportunity to speak to what students might need at this particular point in the course.

  **This Week**: Review the key skills students will be learning this week.

  **This Week's Assignment**: Give a quick summary of this week's Challenge assignment and describe how the skills they learn throughout the week will be applied to it.

  **Career Connection**: Reinforce that students will use the skills they learn this week throughout their careers. It's important for them to know the "why" and "how" behind the "what." Give examples of how these skills are used on the job. If you feel comfortable, share examples of how you have used them in your professional career. The first few questions are intended to get students talking, so make sure to manage your time effectively. Only plan to spend about 20&ndash;30 seconds on the first few questions so that you have more time to discuss how to become employer-ready.

  * Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝ If your goal is to make a career transition or get a promotion after the boot camp, how can you ensure your success?

    * 🙋 Just completing the boot camp is not enough. We need to prepare for job applications and interviews.

    * ☝ What is career services?

    * 🙋 Career services is your partner in success. The career team has talked with thousands of employers and knows exactly what they are looking for in top candidates. Career services content is built around this knowledge to ensure your materials are ready for the positions you want.

    * ☝ What is a career services milestone?

    * 🙋 Career services curriculum is broken down into manageable milestones. Throughout the boot camp, we will direct you to complete a milestone where applicable. You can complete these in any order you wish.

    * ☝ Where do you find career services milestones?

    * 🙋 Career services milestones are found in our course calendar in BCS.

  * Navigate to the [Intro to career services webpage](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp).

    * If we navigate to the career services site, we find an overview of career services.

    * If we watch the [career services: Your Partner in Success video](https://youtu.be/VkVbyg707fI), we will learn about career services and who to contact during your boot camp experience.

  * Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝ What does it mean to be **employer-ready**?

    * 🙋 To be employer-ready, we need a resume, LinkedIn profile, and portfolio.

    * ☝ Why is it important to be employer-ready at graduation?

    * 🙋 Students that earn employer-ready status are the most successful in obtaining a new position after the boot camp.

    * ☝ What does it mean to be **employer-competitive**?

    * 🙋 Employer-competitive students go beyond the minimum requirements by engaging in activities such as networking, research,️ deploying projects, and creating a GitHub profile with high-quality README files and pinned repositories.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to the [career services website](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp), and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

  **How to Succeed This Week**: Remind students that they might experience moments of frustration as they learn complex concepts and tools, and that these times are actually proven opportunities to deepen knowledge. Consider sharing something about your personal learning journey. This helps students recognize that everyone starts somewhere and that they are not alone.

  **Today's Objectives**: Outline the concepts that will be covered in today's lesson. Remind students that they can find the relevant activity files in the "Getting Ready for Class" page in their course content.

### 2. Instructor Do: Student Check-In (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

  * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back at what we've accomplished and acknowledge that it is a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed&mdash;as long as you don’t give up.

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic?

  * 🙋 Let's do Fist to Five together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 3. Instructor Demo: Command Line (5 min)

* Use the prompts and talking points (:key:) below to review the following key points (✔️ ):

  * ✔️ Creating files and folders from the command line

  * ✔️ Opening and editing files from the command line

  * ✔️ Removing files and folders from the command line

* Run and explain the following commands from the command line:

  * 🔑 To create a directory, we use the "make directory" command, `mkdir`:

     ```sh
     mkdir demo-project
     ```

  * 🔑 To create a file, we use the `touch` command:

     ```sh
     touch README.md
     ```

  * 🔑 To open our `README.md` in VS Code, we use the `code` command:

     ```sh
     code README.md
     ```

  * A good README begins with the title of its project. `# Demo Project` is good enough for this one.

  * 🔑 To copy our `README.md` into the `demo-project` folder, we use the copy command, `cp`:

     ```sh
     cp README.md demo-project/README.md
     ```

  * 🔑 To delete the original `README.md`, we use the remove command, `rm`:

     ```sh
     rm README.md
     ```

  * 🔑 To delete the `demo-project` directory, we also use the `rm` command, and because it's not empty, we need to use the `-r` switch:

     ```sh
     rm -r demo-project
     ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We learned how to create and remove files and directories from the command line in Lesson 1.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

  * 🙋 Many developer tools, such as Git, are primarily used from the command line. Also, working from the command line will speed up our development workflow.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Command Line (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-Command-Line/README.md`, which are also shown here:

   ```md
   # Command Line

     ```

  * 🔑 To open our `README.md` in VS Code, we use the `code` command:

     ```sh
     code README.md
     ```

  * We type `# My Awesome Project` as the title of this `README.md`.

  * 🔑 To copy our `README.md` into the `my-awesome-project` folder, we use the copy command, `cp`:

     ```sh
     cp README.md demo-project/README.md
     ```

  * 🔑 To delete the original `README.md`, we use the remove command, `rm`:

     ```sh
     rm README.md
     ```

  * 🔑 To delete the `my-awesome-project` directory, we also use the `rm` command, but because it's not empty, we need to use the `-r` switch:

  * ☝️ How do you move a file or folder?

  * 🙋 To move a file or folder, we use the `mv` command.

  * ☝️ How would you write to a file without opening it?

  * 🙋 We can use the `echo` command to write to a file without opening, like so: `echo "Hello World!" > README.md`

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to the lessons, read the [Git command-line documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-The-Command-Line), and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: HTML (5 min)

* Use the prompts and talking points (:key:) below to review the following key points (✔️ ):

  * ✔️ Headings

  * ✔️ Images

  * ✔️ Paragraphs

  * ✔️ Anchors

  * ✔️ Unordered lists

* Open `02-HTML/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 This is a simple portfolio built using only HTML. It adheres to accessibility guidelines by using only one top-level section heading and two second-level headings.

  * 🔑 We can also see that it features an image, using a placeholder. We can update this with our own image.

  * 🔑 There is a paragraph element below the image, where we can write a bit about ourselves.

  * 🔑 The portfolio uses an unordered list in the contact section to display important information.

  * 🔑 We use anchor tags to create links for email, and GitHub and LinkedIn profiles.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We were introduced to HTML elements in Lesson 1 and Lesson 2 to build the Run Buddy website.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

  * 🙋 This activity is a review of the fundamentals of HTML.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We would start by creating an HTML file, declaring its `DOCTYPE`, then adding a `head` and `body` element. Within the `head` element, we would add a `title` element. Within the `body` element, we would add semantic elements for each of the sections, headings for those sections, image and paragraph elements, and an unordered list that contains anchor tags.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: HTML (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-HTML/README.md`, which are also shown here:

   ```md
   # HTML

   In this activity, you will use HTML to create a simple portfolio.

   ## Instructions

   * Create an HTML file and name it `index.html`.

   * Using HTML, create a simple portfolio similar to the following image:

   ![A portfolio mockup with a title, student's name, a photo, text, and contact info in an unordered list](html-mockup.png)

  * Add a title to the head element.

  * Use semantic elements for each section.

   * Include a photo of yourself or use <https://placehold.it/200x200> as an image placeholder.

  * Include a short paragraph about yourself or use placeholder text.

  * Include links to an email address, Github profile, and LinkedIn profile in an unordered list.
   ```

### 8. Instructor Review: HTML (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points (:key:) below to review the following key points (✔️ ):

  * ✔️ DOCTYPE

  * ✔️ HTML, head, and body elements

  * ✔️ Title

  * ✔️ Semantic elements

  * ✔️ Headings

  * ✔️ Images

  * ✔️ Paragraphs

  * ✔️ Anchors

  * ✔️ Unordered lists

* Open `02-HTML/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We first created a new file, `index.html`. On the first line, we add the document type declaration:

     ```html
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     ```

  * 🔑 We next add an `<html>` element with a language attribute, followed by a `<head>` element:

     ```html
     <html lang="en-us">
       <head></head>
     </html>
     ```

  * Our closing `</html>` tag is at the bottom of the file, wrapping all of our content.

  * 🔑 Our head contains a `<meta>` tag that specifies the character encoding and a `<title>` element. The text in the `<title>` element will be rendered in the browser tab.

     ```html
     <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8" />
       <title>HTML</title>
     </head>
     ```

  * None of the content in the `<head>` element will be rendered in the browser window.

  * 🔑 Below our closing `</head>` tag, we add a `<body>` tag. The first element we create is a `<header>`, containing an `<h1>` with placeholder text for "Your Name":

     ```html
     <body>
       <!-- Site Header -->
       <header>
         <!-- h1: The most important headline -->
         <h1>Your Name</h1>
       </header>
     </body>
     ```

  * 🔑 Below our `<header>`, we add a `<main>` section. Inside the `<main>` section, we add two sections using the `<section>` tag. Our first section contains a second-level heading, an image, and a paragraph that contains an anchor:

     ```html
     <main>
       <!-- Section 1: Bio -->
       <section>
         <!-- h2: Tier-2 Headline (Not as important as the h1 header, but more than one allowed). -->
         <h2>Portfolio</h2>

         <!-- Image with link -->
         <img src="https://placehold.it/200x200" alt="Your Name" />

         <!-- Paragraph with embedded link -->
         <p>
           Write a short paragraph or two about yourself, or use
           <a href="http://www.lipsum.com/">Lorem Ipsum</a> placeholder text.
         </p>
       </section>
     ```

  * 🔑 Our second section also contains a second-level heading and an unordered list of anchors:

     ```html
       <!-- Section 2: Contact Info -->
       <section>
         <!-- h2: Tier-2 Headline -->
         <h2>Contact Info</h2>

         <!-- Unordered list -->
         <ul>
           <li>
             <strong>Email:</strong>
             <a href="mailto:someone@somesite.com">someone@somesite.com</a>
           </li>
           <li><strong>Github:</strong> <a href="#">username</a></li>
           <li><strong>LinkedIn:</strong> <a href="#">LinkedIn</a></li>
         </ul>
       </section>
     </main>
     ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why did we name our HTML file `index.html`?

  * 🙋 `index.html` is the default name a server expects to find in order to serve our HTML.

  * ☝️ Which of these HTML elements are semantic?

  * 🙋 All of them! Every element serves a specific purpose related to the content that it contains.

  * ☝️ What is an example of an HTML element that **is not** semantic?

  * 🙋 A `<div>` is an example of an HTML element that is not semantic.

  * ☝️ Why did we use `<h2>` elements in our sections?

  * 🙋 For accessibility and SEO purposes, it is considered best practice to only use one `<h1>` per webpage, and to follow heading rank, which means not skipping heading levels.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [MDN Web Docs on HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Everyone Do: Git (30 min)

* Students have already reviewed the basics of creating a remote repository on GitHub as well as commonly used Git commands. This Git activity will focus on configuring the local Git default branch to `main`, using `git init` to create a local repository, and reviewing the `git pull` command (because they will use it frequently to pull down the class repository before every class).

* Open [Git Basics—Getting a Git Repository](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) in your browser and explain the following:

  * Git is an important tool that allows developers to track and store versions of content. Using a Git repository, we can save different versions of a project's code.

  * Creating a repository is an important part of the development process and should be done each time you start a new project.

  * We can create a repository and use it on a local machine in two ways&mdash;we can create the remote repository on GitHub first and then use `git clone` to clone it onto the local machine, or we can turn a local directory or project and into a Git repository using `git init`.

  * We already covered how to clone a remote repository, so today we will learn how to turn an existing local project into a Git repository.

  * But first we will need to configure the local Git default branch to `main`.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `Git-Guide/README.md`.

* Open your command line and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 Before you begin, you need to ensure that the default branch is `main`. If you have not done so yet, follow the instructions in the Git Guide and use `git config` to make that switch. If you have any issues, ask a TA for help or stay for office hours:

    ```bash
    git config --global init.defaultBranch main
    ```

* Open your command line and demonstrate the following:

  * Alternatively, we can use `git init` to create a repository. The results will be similar to if we used `git clone`, except that we start by creating a repository locally via the command line.

  * 🔑 Start by creating a new project directory named `git-init-sample` on your local machine. Ideally, you should store all of your coding projects for this course in a parent directory. Create this project directory inside that parent directory:

    ```bash
    mkdir git-init-sample
    ```

  * We use `cd` to navigate into new project directory and `touch` to add an `index.html` file:

    ```bash
    cd git-init-sample
    touch index.html
    ```

  * To initialize this folder as a Git repository, we will use `git init`&mdash;we need to be in the project folder when we run this command!

    ```bash
    git init
    ```

  * This creates a new subdirectory named `.git` that contains all of the necessary repository files&mdash;a Git repository skeleton.

  * To start version-controlling the existing files in the project, we need to start tracking those files and do an initial commit.

  * First let's run `git status` to check the status of the files:

    ```bash
    git status
    ```

  * We should see that `index.html` is currently untracked. Let's stage that file for commit:

    ```bash
    git add -A
    ```

  * Now if we run `git status` again, we should see that the file is being tracked and is ready to be committed:

    ```bash
    git commit -m "initial commit"
    ```

  * 🔑 Using `git init` adds version control locally to a project, but it doesn't create a remote repository. Let's do that now.

* Open [GitHub](https://github.com/) in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * Click on the New button to create a new repository.

  * Enter the same name as the local repository, `git-init-sample`.

  * 🔑 Do not check any of the boxes, because we are importing an existing repository!

  * Click the Create Repository button.

  * Copy the code under the header "…or push an existing repository from the command line".

* Open your command line and demonstrate the following:

  * Back in your project directory, paste the commands copied from GitHub. This will sync your local repository with the repository that you just created on GitHub.

* Open the `git-init-sample` repository on GitHub in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * The repository has been updated on GitHub!

* Open your command line and demonstrate the following:

  * You will need to pull down the class repository before each class in this course to have that day's activities ready.

  * To perform a `git pull`, first navigate to the project directory using `cd`:

    ```bash
    cd git-init-sample
    ```

  * Next, use `git pull` to pull down the changes from the remote. Just like when we did a `git push`, we use `origin` to represent the original directory&mdash;or more precisely, the original repository's URL&mdash;followed by the name of the branch, which is `main`:

    ```bash
    git pull origin main
    ```

  * You can view any changes by opening the project directory in VS Code.

* Answer any questions before proceeding.

### 10. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

  * 🙋 Git and GitHub are important tools for developers, not just for workflow, but for becoming employer-competitive. Command-line basics and HTML are also fundamental to being a successful developer.

  * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

  * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely.

  * ☝️ Why is it important to complete as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

  * 🙋 It's important for two reasons: to be fully prepared to start the Challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic enough depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will also use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

  * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

  * 🙋 We can learn more about terminal commands and basic HTML elements in Lesson 1 and more advanced HTML elements in Lesson 2.

  * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

  * 🙋 In the next session, we will review CSS, relative paths, and deploying sites using GitHub Personal Pages.

* Answer any questions before ending the class.
