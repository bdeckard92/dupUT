# 01.1 Virtual Class: HTML, CSS, and Git

## Overview

In today's virtual class, students will review HTML and HTML attributes.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Explain what it takes to become employer-ready.

* Add structure and content to a webpage using HTML elements.

* Add attributes to configure or adjust behavior of specific elements.

## Instructor Notes

* Congratulations&mdash;this is your first virtual class! Be yourself and make it fun. If you're having a good time, your students will too. Good luck!

* It's likely that students will have a hard time adapting to the command line. If the command-line activity ends early, use the remaining time to demonstrate other commands, such as `cd`, `pwd`, and `cat`. Extra practice with the command line will help the students acclimate more quickly.

* In today's first activity, Career Connection, you will navigate to the career services website and play a short introduction video. Make sure to load this in your browser before class. If you have extra time, use it to discuss your personal experience with getting a developer job. If you feel comfortable doing so, share your professional portfolio and your GitHub and/or LinkedIn profiles. The first few questions are intended to get students talking, so make sure to manage your time effectively. Only plan to spend about 20&ndash;30 seconds on the first few questions so that you have more time to discuss how to become employer-ready.

* During activities, encourage students to refer to the provided user stories and acceptance criteria to identify the user's goal and the conditions that must be met for the solution to be accepted. Doing so will help reinforce their computational thinking skills and set them up for success in future coding challenges.

* In the asynchronous content, students are introduced to the command line and basic HTML elements in Lesson 1, and more advanced HTML elements in Lesson 2.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Invite students to post questions in the Zoom chat so TAs and/or the instructor can address them at the end of class.

* Open the lesson's [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dI5n5w5sXG4fNIKQzkQZcbhji7D1IR1zrurEuNhVyl8/edit?usp=sharing) and walk through the following slides on foundation setting:

  **Big Picture**: This is an opportunity to look at the big picture of where students are in the course. Take a moment to discuss a few real-world examples of why this week's topics are valuable.

  **Boot Camp Pointers**: Review some logistics that will help students stay on track. This is an opportunity to speak to what students might need at this particular point in the course.

  **This Week**: Review the key skills students will be learning this week.

  **This Week's Assignment**: Give a quick summary of this week's Challenge assignment and describe how the skills they learn throughout the week will be applied to it.

  **Career Connection**: Reinforce that students will use the skills they learn this week throughout their careers. It's important for them to know the "why" and "how" behind the "what." Give examples of how these skills are used on the job. If you feel comfortable, share examples of how you have used them in your professional career. The first few questions are intended to get students talking, so make sure to manage your time effectively. Only plan to spend about 20&ndash;30 seconds on the first few questions so that you have more time to discuss how to become employer-ready.

  * Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝ If your goal is to make a career transition or get a promotion after the boot camp, how can you ensure your success?

    * 🙋 Just completing the boot camp is not enough. We need to prepare for job applications and interviews.

    * ☝ What is career services?

    * 🙋 Career services is your partner in success. The career team has talked with thousands of employers and knows exactly what they are looking for in top candidates. Career services content is built around this knowledge to ensure your materials are ready for the positions you want.

    * ☝ What is a career services milestone?

    * 🙋 Career services curriculum is broken down into manageable milestones. Throughout the boot camp, we will direct you to complete a milestone where applicable. You can complete these in any order you wish.

    * ☝ Where do you find career services milestones?

    * 🙋 Career services milestones are found in our course calendar in BCS.

  * Navigate to the [Intro to career services webpage](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp).

    * If we navigate to the career services site, we find an overview of career services.

    * If we watch the [career services: Your Partner in Success video](https://youtu.be/VkVbyg707fI), we will learn about career services and who to contact during your boot camp experience.

  * Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝ What does it mean to be **employer-ready**?

    * 🙋 To be employer-ready, we need a resume, LinkedIn profile, and portfolio.

    * ☝ Why is it important to be employer-ready at graduation?

    * 🙋 Students that earn employer-ready status are the most successful in obtaining a new position after the boot camp.

    * ☝ What does it mean to be **employer-competitive**?

    * 🙋 Employer-competitive students go beyond the minimum requirements by engaging in activities such as networking, research,️ deploying projects, and creating a GitHub profile with high-quality README files and pinned repositories.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to the [career services website](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp), and attend Office Hours to ask for help.

  **How to Succeed This Week**: Remind students that they might experience moments of frustration as they learn complex concepts and tools, and that these times are actually proven opportunities to deepen knowledge. Consider sharing something about your personal learning journey. This helps students recognize that everyone starts somewhere and that they are not alone.

  **Today's Agenda**: Outline the concepts that will be covered in today's lesson. Remind students that they can find the relevant activity files in the "Getting Ready for Class" page in their course content.

### 2. Instructor Do: Student Check-In (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

  * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back at what we've accomplished and acknowledge that it is a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed&mdash;as long as we don’t give up.

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic?

  * 🙋 Let's do Fist to Five together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 3. Instructor Demo: HTML (5 min)

* Open `01-HTML/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 This is a simple portfolio built using only HTML. It adheres to accessibility guidelines by using only one top-level section heading and two second-level headings.

  * 🔑 We can also see that it features an image, using a placeholder. We can replace this with our own image.

  * 🔑 There is a paragraph element below the image, where we can write a bit about ourselves.

  * 🔑 The portfolio uses an unordered list in the contact section to display important information.

  * 🔑 We use anchor tags to create links for email, GitHub, and a portfolio.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We were introduced to HTML elements in Lesson 1 and Lesson 2 to build the Run Buddy website.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

  * 🙋 This activity is a review of HTML fundamentals.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We would start by creating an HTML file, declaring its `DOCTYPE`, then adding a `head` and `body` element. Within the `head` element, we would add a `title` element. Within the `body` element, we would add semantic elements for each section, headings for those sections, image and paragraph elements, and an unordered list that contains anchor tags.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: HTML (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-HTML/README.md`, which are also shown here:

  ```md
  # 🏗️ Create a Webpage Using HTML

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a student, I want to create a biography page that includes an image, a paragraph about me, and my contact information.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when the main header reads "Student Bio".

  * It's done when there is a section that includes a name, an image, and a paragraph.

  * It's done when there is a second section that includes a subheader labeled "Contact Info" and a list that includes links to my email, GitHub, and portfolio.

  * It's done when the finished page matches the mockup.

  ## Assets

  The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

  ![Webpage titled "Student Bio" features "Your Name" heading, a spot for an image and bio, and a "Contact Info" section.](./assets/image-1.png)

  You can use this [placeholder image](https://via.placeholder.com/200).

  ---

  ## 💡 Hints

  How can you use header elements to define the most important heading and the subheaders? How does using different header elements impact the size of the text?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What are the advantages of using semantic HTML elements?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 5. Instructor Review: HTML (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with HTML? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use Office Hours to get extra help.

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `<body>`

  * ✔️ `<header>`

  * ✔️ `<h1>` through `<h6>`

  * ✔️ `<img>`

  * ✔️ `<ul>`

  * ✔️ `<a>`

* Open `01-HTML/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We place all the visible content inside the `<body>` element.

  * 🔑 We use a semantic `<header>` element to define the area of the website that is used as the header. While not visible on their own, **semantic** elements make the structure of your webpage easily readable by the browser, as well as accessible.

  * 🔑 We add the content of the main heading in an `<h1>` element.

    ```html
    <header>
      <h1>Student Bio</h1>
    </header>
    ```

  * We use the semantic element `<section>` to define the two sections of the webpage.

  * Within each section, we add heading elements. For the purpose of accessibility, it is important not to skip heading levels&mdash;so we will use `<h2>` for the section headings because we used `<h1>` for the main heading.

    ```html
    <h2>Your Name</h2>
    ```

  * 🔑 To add an image to the bio section, we will include an `<img>` element, using `src` to specify the path to the image.

    ```html
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/200" alt="Your Name">
    ```

  * We can use a `<p>` element to add a paragraph of text to the webpage.

    ```html
    <p>Write a short paragraph or two about yourself</p>
    ```

  * 🔑 The `<ul>` element allows us to create an unordered list.

    ```html
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="#">someplace@gmail.com</a></li>
      <li><strong>GitHub:</strong> <a href="#">sampleName</a></li>
      <li><strong>Portfolio:</strong> <a href="#">coming soon</a></li>
    </ul>
    ```

  * 🔑 We can use the `<a>` element to add a link to the list items in the preceding example. Inside this element, we specify the link's destination.

    ```html
    <a href="#">someplace@gmail.com</a>
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why did we name our HTML file `index.html`?

  * 🙋 `index.html` is the default name a server expects to find in order to serve HTML.

  * ☝️ What is an example of an HTML element that **is not** semantic?

  * 🙋 A `<div>` is an example of an HTML element that is not semantic. Explain why.

  * ☝️ Why did we use `<h2>` elements in our sections?

  * 🙋 For accessibility and SEO purposes, it is considered best practice to only use one `<h1>` per webpage, and to follow heading rank, which means not skipping heading levels.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [MDN Web Docs on HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), and attend Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Attributes (5 min)

* Open `02-Attributes/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * We use attributes to configure or adjust the behavior of specific elements.

  * Attributes are commonly used with link and image elements to provide important information.

  * We also use global attributes to identify elements for styling.

* Open `02-Attributes/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

    * Now let's set up the HTML document to use CSS so that we can apply the rules written in the style sheet to the webpage. A **style sheet** is a list of CSS properties that defines how HTML elements are displayed.

  * We will add a `<link>` element to connect the HTML page to an external CSS style sheet. Within that element, the `href` attribute specifies the relative path, and the `rel` attribute describes the relationship.

    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/style.css">
    ```

  * Global attributes can be used on any element. They are often used to identify elements and set up the HTML elements for styling.

  * A `class` attribute can be used to select and style one or more elements.

    ```html
    <section class="section">
    ```

  * The `id` attribute is used to select a single element for styling.

    ```html
    <li id="email"><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="#">someplace@gmail.com</a></li>
    ```

  * We include the `src` attribute with an image element to specify the image's absolute or relative path.

    ```html
    <img src="./assets/images/image-1.jpg">
    ```

  * Each image should also include an `alt` attribute. An `alt` attribute provides text that describes the image. This attribute makes your image accessible to users who cannot see it or who use assistive technologies to browse the web.

    ```html
    <img src="./assets/images/image-1.jpg" alt="Placeholder image with text 200 width and 200 height ">
    ```

  * Within an `<a>` element, we use an `href` attribute to specify the URL of the page we want to link to.

    ```html
    <a href="#">someplace@gmail.com</a>
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We were introduced to attributes in Lesson 1 and Lesson 2 to build the Run Buddy website.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

  * 🙋 This activity is a review of the fundamentals of adding attributes to our HTML and prepares us to add a stylesheet and target HTML elements for styling with an external stylesheet.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We would start by creating an HTML file and adding elements. Attributes are added to elements to provide additional information.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Attributes (15 min)

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Attributes/README.md`, which are also shown here:

  ```md
  # 🐛 Images and Styles Not Appearing on Page

  Work with a partner to resolve the following issues:

  * As a user, I should be able to see an image on the page, and `alt` text that describes the image should be provided.

  * As a user, I should see background colors applied to each section and list item, and the header text should be dark blue.

  ## Expected Behavior

  * When a user opens the page, an image should appear, and `alt` text describing the image should be provided.

  * When a user opens the page, each section and list item should have a background color applied, and the header text should be dark blue.

  ## Actual Behavior

  * When a user opens the page, no image appears and `alt` text describing the image is not shown.

  * When a user opens the page, each section and list item does not have a background color applied.

  * When a user opens the page, the header text is not dark blue.

  ## Assets

  The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

  ![The portfolio page features headings in dark-blue text, rounded corners on the image placeholder, and various background colors.](./assets/image-1.png)

  ---

  ## 💡 Hints

  Why is it important to give each global attribute a unique name?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What other attributes can be used with HTML elements?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into pairs, remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 8. Instructor Review: Attributes (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with attributes? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use Office Hours to get extra help.

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `class`

  * ✔️  `id`

  * ✔️  `href`

* Open `02-Attributes/Solved/index.html` in your browser and explain the following:

  * We add global attributes to the HTML elements to allow them to be styled with CSS.

* Open `02-Attributes/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We use a global `class` attribute to add a `section` identifier to all sections.

    ```html
    <section class="section">
    ```

  * 🔑 We use a global `id` attribute to add a unique identifier to the email list item.

    ```html
    <li id="email"><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="#">someplace@gmail.com</a></li>
    ```

  * We use a global `id` attribute to add a unique identifier to the GitHub list item.

    ```html
    <li id="github"><strong>GitHub:</strong> <a href="#">sampleName</a></li>
    ```

  * We use a global `id` attribute to add a unique identifier to the portfolio list item.

    ```html
    <li id="portfolio"><strong>Portfolio:</strong> <a href="#">coming soon</a></li>
    ```

  * 🔑 We can link to the external style sheet using a `<link>` element in the `<head>`. The `href` attribute specifies the relative path. Without this link and the `href` attribute pointing to the right path, the styles will not be displayed!

    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/style.css">
    ```

   * 🔑 So that our image appears, we add a relative path to our image's `src` attribute. We also add an `alt` attribute to describe the image. The `alt` attribute is important.

    ```html
    <img src="./assets/images/image-1.jpg" alt="Placeholder image with text 200 width and 200 height ">
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How do we use global attributes to set up the HTML elements to connect with CSS?

  * 🙋 We use `class` and `id` attributes to identify elements that we want to style.

  * ☝️ How do we use the `href` attribute with a `<link>` element to connect the CSS style sheet?

  * 🙋 We use the `href` attribute to specify the relative path to the style sheet.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on HTML attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes), and attend Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Everyone Do: Git (30 min)

* Students have already reviewed the basics of creating a remote repository on GitHub as well as commonly used Git commands. This Git activity will focus on configuring the local Git default branch to `main`, using `git init` to create a local repository, and reviewing the `git pull` command (because they will use it frequently to pull down the class repository before every class).

* Open [Git Basics—Getting a Git Repository](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) in your browser and explain the following:

  * Git is an important tool that allows developers to track and store versions of content. Using a Git repository, we can save different versions of a project's code.

  * Creating a repository is an important part of the development process and should be done each time you start a new project.

  * We can create a repository and use it on a local machine in two ways&mdash;we can create the remote repository on GitHub first and then use `git clone` to clone it onto the local machine, or we can turn a local directory or project and into a Git repository using `git init`.

  * We already covered how to clone a remote repository, so today we will learn how to turn an existing local project into a Git repository.

  * But first we will need to configure the local Git default branch to `main`.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `Git-Guide/README.md`.

* Open your command line and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 Before you begin, you need to ensure that the default branch is `main`. If you have not done so yet, follow the instructions in the Git Guide and use `git config` to make that switch. If you have any issues, ask a TA for help or stay for office hours:

    ```bash
    git config --global init.defaultBranch main
    ```

* Open your command line and demonstrate the following:

  * Alternatively, we can use `git init` to create a repository. The results will be similar to if we used `git clone`, except that we start by creating a repository locally via the command line.

  * 🔑 Start by creating a new project directory named `git-init-sample` on your local machine. Ideally, you should store all of your coding projects for this course in a parent directory. Create this project directory inside that parent directory:

    ```bash
    mkdir git-init-sample
    ```

  * We use `cd` to navigate into new project directory and `touch` to add an `index.html` file:

    ```bash
    cd git-init-sample
    touch index.html
    ```

  * To initialize this folder as a Git repository, we will use `git init`&mdash;we need to be in the project folder when we run this command!

    ```bash
    git init
    ```

  * This creates a new subdirectory named `.git` that contains all of the necessary repository files&mdash;a Git repository skeleton.

  * To start version-controlling the existing files in the project, we need to start tracking those files and do an initial commit.

  * First let's run `git status` to check the status of the files:

    ```bash
    git status
    ```

  * We should see that `index.html` is currently untracked. Let's stage that file for commit:

    ```bash
    git add -A
    ```

  * Now if we run `git status` again, we should see that the file is being tracked and is ready to be committed:

    ```bash
    git commit -m "initial commit"
    ```

  * 🔑 Using `git init` adds version control locally to a project, but it doesn't create a remote repository. Let's do that now.

* Open [GitHub](https://github.com/) in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * Click on the New button to create a new repository.

  * Enter the same name as the local repository, `git-init-sample`.

  * 🔑 Do not check any of the boxes, because we are importing an existing repository!

  * Click the Create Repository button.

  * Copy the code under the header "…or push an existing repository from the command line".

* Open your command line and demonstrate the following:

  * Back in your project directory, paste the commands copied from GitHub. This will sync your local repository with the repository that you just created on GitHub.

* Open the `git-init-sample` repository on GitHub in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * The repository has been updated on GitHub!

* Open your command line and demonstrate the following:

  * You will need to pull down the class repository before each class in this course to have that day's activities ready.

  * To perform a `git pull`, first navigate to the project directory using `cd`:

    ```bash
    cd git-init-sample
    ```

  * Next, use `git pull` to pull down the changes from the remote. Just like when we did a `git push`, we use `origin` to represent the original directory&mdash;or more precisely, the original repository's URL&mdash;followed by the name of the branch, which is `main`:

    ```bash
    git pull origin main
    ```

  * You can view any changes by opening the project directory in VS Code.

* Answer any questions before proceeding.

### 10. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

  * 🙋 Git and GitHub are important tools for developers&mdash;not just for workflow, but for becoming employer-competitive. Command-line basics and HTML are also fundamental to being a successful developer.

  * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

  * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely.

  * ☝️ Why is it important to complete as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

  * 🙋 It's important for two reasons: to be fully prepared to start the Challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic enough depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will also use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

  * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

  * 🙋 We can learn more about HTML elements starting with Lesson 1 and HTML attributes in Lesson 2.

  * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

  * 🙋 In the next session, we will review CSS selectors, the box model, and positioning.

* Answer any questions before ending the class.
