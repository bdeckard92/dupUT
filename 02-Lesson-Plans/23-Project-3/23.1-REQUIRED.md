# Module 23 Virtual Class: Project 3

## Overview

In today's virtual class, students will review Project 3 requirements. Students will also use this time to work on their group projects.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Finalize project ideas

* Delegate project tasks among group members

* Begin assigning issues or tasks

## Instructor Notes

* In today's class, you will review the project requirements and help students finalize their project ideas.

* There are occasional circumstances, such as an illness or a personal emergency, which might force a student to complete a group project on their own. In these circumstances, as the instructor, you will meet with the student and SSM to determine if completing the project independently is the best path forward. If it is, you will share adjusted project requirements and a grading rubric with the student.

* If students need a refresher on deploying their project to Heroku, refer them to Module 21 Lesson 6 in Canvas.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (5 min)

    * 🙋 Your journey towards becoming a web developer in this course is complete! Congratulations on reaching this monumental milestone!

    * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel about this project?
