# Module 23 Virtual Class: Project 03

## Overview

In today's virtual class, students will review Project 03 requirements. Students will also use this time to work on their group projects.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Create groups for the final project.

* Submit a project proposal (ideas, outlines, APIs) for feedback.

* Create a project repo that is set up with linting and group members as collaborators.

## Instructor Notes

* Today students will begin work on their final projects. These projects are student-driven; they will be responsible for forming their own teams, brainstorming app ideas, and developing a full-stack MERN app.

* Encourage students to start forming groups and brainstorming ideas for their apps, and be prepared to help anyone who is struggling to find a group or project idea.

* Leverage the TAs to help any groups lagging behind during the lesson. We want to give students as much time to brainstorm project ideas as possible.

* If students need a refresher on deploying their project to Heroku, refer them to [Deploy with Heroku and MongoDB Atlas](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/deploy-with-heroku-and-mongodb-atlas) on the Full-Stack Blog.

* There are occasional circumstances, such as an illness or a personal emergency, which might force a student to complete a group project on their own. In these circumstances, as the instructor, you will meet with the student and SSM to determine if completing the project independently is the best path forward. If it is, you will share adjusted project requirements and a grading rubric with the student.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (5 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Invite students to post questions in the Zoom chat so TAs and/or the instructor can address them at the end of class.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è How are you feeling about your progress so far?

    * üôã Your journey towards becoming a web developer in this course is complete! Congratulations on reaching this monumental milestone!

    * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel about this project?

    * üôã Let's do Fist to Five together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).


### 2. Everyone Do: Review Project Requirements (10 min)

* Use the [Project 03 slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ClrBuo-QzQEiw5g4y7GYuUSWcNVDOmlErTN8gbLWy3A/edit?usp=sharing) to review the project requirements:

  * **Project Requirements**: Discuss the project requirements outlined in the slide deck.

  * **Presentation Requirements**: Discuss the presentation requirements outlined in the slide deck.

  * **Project Metrics**: Your project will be evaluated on its concept, design, functionality, collaboration, and presentation, as well as the quality of your GitHub repository and whether or not your application is deployed.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next section.

### 3. Recap (5 min)

* Direct the students to start working on their group projects:

    * You can now use the remaining time to work on your project with your group.

    * Be sure to finalize your project idea, delegate project tasks among group members, and begin assigning issues or tasks using your project management tool of choice.

    * **Remember** that everyone will submit and present their projects during next week's virtual class, so be ready for that!

    * If you need direction on deploying your application to Heroku, you can refer to Lesson 6 in Module 21.

### 4. Student Do: Group Project (100 min)
