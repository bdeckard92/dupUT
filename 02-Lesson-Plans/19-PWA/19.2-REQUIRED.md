# Module 19 Virtual Class (Required): Progressive Web Applications (PWA)

## Overview 

In today's required virtual class, students will practice registering, installing, and activating a service worker for the 'Image Gallery' app that we used in the recommended virtual class. In the last activity, students will implement offline functionality to a Notetaker app.


## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Register, install, and activate the service worker

* Create a `manifest.json` file


## Instructor Notes 

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* Service workers were covered in Lesson 4 and converting an app to a PWA was covered in Lesson 5.

## Office Hours

Encourage students to work on the remaining module algorithms during Office Hours. Review the algorithm solutions 5–10 minutes before class begins or during Office Hours after class.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What did you learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

    * 🙋 We learned about PWAs and implementing offline functionality to apps. We are moving fast compared to traditional learners. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ Did anyone have an "Aha!" or "Eureka!" moment this week? When was it and why did things suddenly click for you? 

    * 🙋 Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we're thinking about it.

    * ☝️ Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

    * 🙋 It's easy to get stuck when you're learning web development. It's important to learn how to get unstuck because it happens to the pros too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the tool's official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups are great because explaining your problems to someone else often reveals the solution. 


### 2. Review Current Challenge (5 min)

@TODO USE THE FOLLOWING FOR BROWSER AND/OR COMMAND LINE DEMOS, RESPECTIVELY. REMOVE IF UNUSED
* Open `@TODO/folder/file` in your browser and demonstrate the following:
* Run `@TODO/folder/file { AND ARGS, IF ANY }` from the command line and demonstrate the following: 

    * @TODO { WHEN WE DO THIS, IT DOES THAT. }

    * @TODO { WE ALSO SEE THESE THINGS. }

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What recently acquired skills will help us build this challenge?

    * 🙋 @TODO { YES, WHAT? }

    * ☝️ How are these skills relevant to a career in web development?

    * 🙋 @TODO { YES, WHAT? }

    * ☝️ How will this challenge improve your portfolio?

    * 🙋 @TODO { YES, HOW? }

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 3. Instructor Demo: Service Worker (5 min) 

* Navigate to `03-Service-Worker/Solved` in your command line and run `npm install`, `npm run seed`, and `npm start` .

* Navigate to <http://localhost:3001> in Chrome and open the Dev Tools to demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 In the Application tab, we see Service Workers on the left menu. When we click it, we can see that our service worker file was successfully found.

    * 🔑 When we check the browser console, we see two messages logged: "Hi from your service-worker.js file!" and "Service Worker registered successfully."

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used service workers to implement offline functionality to our Food Festival app in Lesson 4.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We will need to register service workers in order for our Budget Tracker to work offline.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We will need to add a script to the `index.html` file in order to register the service worker. We will also need to create a `service-worker.js` file.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 4. Student Do: Service Worker  (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `03-Service-Worker/README.md`.

```md
# Service Worker

In this activity, you will be registering a service worker for an 'Image Gallery' app. The script for registering a service worker is standard, which is why it is provided for you. However type out the code snippets instead of simply copying/pasting them to your application. It will help you solidify what you are doing!

## Instructions

* In [index.html](Unsolved/public/index.html), add the following script while paying attention to what each line of code is doing:

<script type="text/javascript">
  (function() {
    if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
      navigator.serviceWorker
        .register('./service-worker.js')
        .then(() => console.log('Service Worker registered successfully.'))
        .catch(error =>
          console.log('Service Worker registration failed:', error)
        );
    }
  })();
</script>

* In the [public](Unsolved/public/) folder, create a `service-worker.js` file and have it print out a message in the console, i.e. "Hi from your service-worker.js file!!"

* Run `npm install`, `npm run seed`, and `npm start` in your command line.

* Navigate to <http://localhost:3001> in Chrome and open the Dev Tools. In the `Application` tab, click on `Service Workers` on the left menu. Check to see if your service worker file was successfully found.

* If done correctly, you should see two messages logged in the browser console: one from the `service-worker.js` file and one from the script tag that you put in your `index.html` file.
```

### 5. Instructor Review: Service Worker  (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ Register service worker in `index.html`

    * ✔️ `service-worker.js`

* Open `03-Service-Worker/Solved/public/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * Although it is easier to copy and paste the code into `index.html` without thinking, try to type out the code yourself while paying attention to what the code is doing.

    * 🔑 First, we add the script that registers the service worker in the `index.html` file

    ```js
    <script type="text/javascript">
      (function() {
        if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
          navigator.serviceWorker
            .register('./service-worker.js')
            .then(() => console.log('Service Worker registered successfully.'))
            .catch(error =>
              console.log('Service Worker registration failed:', error)
            );
        }
      })();
    </script>
    ```

    * It's important that we include the `./` in front of `service-worker.js` to use the relative path and not the absolute path.

    ```js
    .register('./service-worker.js')
    ```

    * If the service worker is registered correctly, we will log 'Service Worker registered successfully.' in the console. If there is an error, we will log an error message in the console.

    ```js
    .then(() => console.log('Service Worker registered successfully.'))
    .catch(error =>
        console.log('Service Worker registration failed:', error)
    );
    ```

    * Since we need a `service-worker.js` file, we create that file in the `public/` folder.

    * 🔑 In the `service-worker.js` file, we have it print out a message in the console for now. 

    ```js
    console.log('Hi from your service-worker.js file!');
    ```

    * In the next activity, we will actually write code to go in that `service-worker.js` file in order to install and activate the service worker.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What are the 3 parts of a service worker lifecycle?

    * 🙋 1. Installation: The service worker creates a version-specific cache.
    
    * 🙋 2. Activation: This event fires after the service worker has been installed and the previous one has been removed
    
    * 🙋 3. Waiting/Idle: The updated service worker waits until the existing service worker is no longer controlling clients. This step is often skipped with a function, because previous service workers rarely exist past a new service worker's installation.

    * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 4, read the [MDN Web Docs on Using Service Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API/Using_Service_Workers), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.
