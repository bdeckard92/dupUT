# Module 19 Virtual Class: Progressive Web Applications (PWA)

## Overview

In today's virtual class, students will practice registering, installing, and activating a service worker for the 'Image Gallery' app that we used in this week's first virtual class. In the last activity, students will implement offline functionality to a Notetaker app.


## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Register, install, and activate the service worker

* Create a `manifest.json` file

## Instructor Notes 

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* In the first two activities, the service worker code has been provided for the students. Encourage the students to examine the code and understand what's happening, instead of just copying and pasting without thinking. The last activity will have the students do it all on their own, so encourage them to pay attention in the first two activities so that they can complete the last activity smoothly.

* Service workers were covered in Lesson 4 and converting an app to a PWA was covered in Lesson 5.

## Office Hours

Encourage students to work on the remaining module algorithms during Office Hours. Review the algorithm solutions 5–10 minutes before class begins or during Office Hours after class.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What did you learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

    * 🙋 We learned about PWAs and implementing offline functionality to apps. We are moving fast compared to traditional learners. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ Did anyone have an "Aha!" or "Eureka!" moment this week? When was it and why did things suddenly click for you? 

    * 🙋 Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we're thinking about it.

    * ☝️ Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

    * 🙋 It's easy to get stuck when you're learning web development. It's important to learn how to get unstuck because it happens to the pros too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the tool's official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups are great because explaining your problems to someone else often reveals the solution. 


### 2. Review Current Challenge (5 min)

* Navigate to `02-Challenge/Main` from the command line and run `npm start`.

* Navigate to <http://localhost:3001> in Chrome and demonstrate the following:

    * We are given a Budget Tracker app that we will convert into a PWA to allow for offline access and functionality. 

    * We can add expenses and deposits to our budget with or without a connection.

    * When we enter a transaction offline, the app will update the total when brought back online.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What recently acquired skills will help us build this challenge?

    * 🙋 Service workers and PWA web manifest will help us implement offline functionality to this app.

    * ☝️ How are these skills relevant to a career in web development?

    * 🙋 PWAs blend the benefits of a traditional browser experience with those of a mobile application. PWAs can ensure applications work without an internet connection by using the Service Worker and Cache APIs to cache assets and API responses. Having the skills to build or convert to PWAs is crucial in this day and age. 

    * ☝️ How will this challenge improve your portfolio?

    * 🙋 It will show employers your ability to measure and optimize the performance of web applications. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 3. Instructor Demo: Service Worker (5 min) 

* Navigate to `03-Service-Worker/Solved` in your command line and run `npm install`, `npm run seed`, and `npm start` .

* Navigate to <http://localhost:3001> in Chrome and open the Dev Tools to demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 In the Application tab, we see Service Workers on the left menu. When we click it, we can see that our service worker file was successfully found.

    * 🔑 When we check the browser console, we see two messages logged: "Hi from your service-worker.js file!" and "Service Worker registered successfully."

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used service workers to implement offline functionality to our Food Festival app in Lesson 4.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We will need to register service workers in order for our Budget Tracker to work offline.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We will need to add a script to the `index.html` file in order to register the service worker. We will also need to create a `service-worker.js` file.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 4. Student Do: Service Worker  (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `03-Service-Worker/README.md`.

```md
# Service Worker

In this activity, you will be registering a service worker for an 'Image Gallery' app. The script for registering a service worker is standard, which is why it is provided for you. However type out the code snippets instead of simply copying/pasting them to your application. It will help you solidify what you are doing!

## Instructions

* In [index.html](Unsolved/public/index.html), add the following script while paying attention to what each line of code is doing:

<script type="text/javascript">
  (function() {
    if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
      navigator.serviceWorker
        .register('./service-worker.js')
        .then(() => console.log('Service Worker registered successfully.'))
        .catch(error =>
          console.log('Service Worker registration failed:', error)
        );
    }
  })();
</script>

* In the [public](Unsolved/public/) folder, create a `service-worker.js` file and have it print out a message in the console, i.e. "Hi from your service-worker.js file!!"

* Run `npm install`, `npm run seed`, and `npm start` in your command line.

* Navigate to <http://localhost:3001> in Chrome and open the Dev Tools. In the `Application` tab, click on `Service Workers` on the left menu. Check to see if your service worker file was successfully found.

* If done correctly, you should see two messages logged in the browser console: one from the `service-worker.js` file and one from the script tag that you put in your `index.html` file.
```

### 5. Instructor Review: Service Worker  (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ Register service worker in `index.html`

    * ✔️ `service-worker.js`

* Open `03-Service-Worker/Solved/public/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * Although it is easier to copy and paste the code into `index.html` without thinking, try to type out the code yourself while paying attention to what the code is doing.

    * 🔑 First, we add the script that registers the service worker in the `index.html` file

    * It's important that we include the `./` in front of `service-worker.js` to use the relative path and not the absolute path.

    * If the service worker is registered correctly, we will log 'Service Worker registered successfully.' in the console. If there is an error, we will log an error message in the console.

    ```js
    <script type="text/javascript">
      (function() {
        if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
          navigator.serviceWorker
            .register('./service-worker.js')
            .then(() => console.log('Service Worker registered successfully.'))
            .catch(error =>
              console.log('Service Worker registration failed:', error)
            );
        }
      })();
    </script>
    ```

    * Since we need a `service-worker.js` file, we create that file in the `public/` folder.

    * 🔑 In the `service-worker.js` file, we have it print out a message in the console for now. 

    ```js
    console.log('Hi from your service-worker.js file!');
    ```

    * In the next activity, we will actually write code to go in that `service-worker.js` file in order to install and activate the service worker.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What are the 3 parts of a service worker lifecycle?

    * 🙋 1. Installation: The service worker creates a version-specific cache.
    
    * 🙋 2. Activation: This event fires after the service worker has been installed and the previous one has been removed
    
    * 🙋 3. Waiting/Idle: The updated service worker waits until the existing service worker is no longer controlling clients. This step is often skipped with a function, because previous service workers rarely exist past a new service worker's installation.

    * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 4, read the [MDN Web Docs on Using Service Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API/Using_Service_Workers), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 6. Instructor Demo: Caching and Fetching Files  (5 min) 

* Navigate to `04-Caching-Fetching-Files/Solved` in your command line and run `npm install`, `npm run seed`, and `npm start` .

* Navigate to <http://localhost:3001> in Chrome and open the Dev Tools to demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 In the Application tab, under Service Workers, we see that the service worker is activated and running.

    * 🔑 We also see the messages "Your files were pre-cached successfully!" and "Service Worker registered successfully" in the console.

    * 🔑 Now if we go offline and refresh the page, we can still view all of the images of the Images Gallery app.

    * 🔑 If we check the Cache Storage in the Dev Tools, we can see all of our images have been cached successfully.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We set up the cache files, installed and activated the service worker in the `service-worker.js` file in Lesson 4.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We will need to incorporate service workers in order for our Budget Tracker to work offline.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 In our `service-worker.js` file, we will need to set up the cache files, install and activate the service worker, and intercept fetch requests. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 7. Student Do: Caching and Fetching Files  (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Caching-Fetching-Files/README.md`.

```md
# Caching and Fetching Files

In this activity, you will be enabling functionality to allow the 'Image Gallery' app to work offline. You will install and activate the service worker that you registered in the previous activity. This will give the service worker the ability to cache the files we tell it to and deliver them in an offline experience for our users. 

Most of this code is standard, which is why they are provided for you. However, type out the code snippets since that will help you solidify what you are doing!

## Instructions

* Navigate to the [Unsolved/](Unsolved/) folder and run `npm install`, `npm run seed`, and `npm start` in your command line.

* Navigate to <http://localhost:3001> in Chrome and open the Dev Tools. Keep your Dev Tools open to monitor your progress and debug if needed.

* Open [service-worker.js](Unsolved/public/service-worker.js) and do the following:

  * Uncomment the code to set up the cache files.

  * Add the following code to install the service worker:

  ![Install service worker](Images/install-code.png)

  * Next, add the following code to activate your service worker and remove any old data from the cache:

  ![Activate service worker](Images/activate-code.png)

  * Finally, add the following code to intercept fetch requests:

    ```js
    self.addEventListener('fetch', function(evt) {
    
    });
    ```

  * Inside that function, if the request with a URL includes `/api/`, we need to handle those requests and store the responses in the cache:

    ```js
    if (evt.request.url.includes('/api/')) {
        evt.respondWith(
        caches
            .open(DATA_CACHE_NAME)
            .then(cache => {
            return fetch(evt.request)
                .then(response => {
                // If the response was good, clone it and store it in the cache.
                if (response.status === 200) {
                    cache.put(evt.request.url, response.clone());
                }

                return response;
                })
                .catch(err => {
                // Network request failed, try to get it from the cache.
                return cache.match(evt.request);
                });
            })
            .catch(err => console.log(err))
        );

        return;
    }
    ```

  * If the request path does not include `/api/`, then we can assume the request is for a static file. Add the following code in the function handling the `fetch` event, right below the code handling the requests to `/api/`:

    ```js
    evt.respondWith(
        fetch(evt.request).catch(function() {
        return caches.match(evt.request).then(function(response) {
            if (response) {
            return response;
            } else if (evt.request.headers.get('accept').includes('text/html')) {
            // return the cached home page for all requests for html pages
            return caches.match('/');
            }
        });
        })
    );
    ```

* If done correctly, you should see your data cache in the Application tab of the Chrome Dev Tool and you should be able to access the Image Gallery app offline.
```

### 8. Instructor Review: Caching and Fetching Files  (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ `FILES_TO_CACHE`

    * ✔️ Install service worker

    * ✔️ Activate service worker

    * ✔️ Intercept fetch requests

* Open `04-Caching-Fetching-Files/Solved/public/service-worker.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * Most of the code was provided for you because the code for service workers is pretty standard. However, you should still pay attention to each line of code to understand what is happening so that you can modify it as necessary for your own app. 

    * First, we set the cache variable names.

    ```js
    const CACHE_NAME = 'my-site-cache-v1';
    const DATA_CACHE_NAME = 'data-cache-v1';
    ```

    * 🔑 Then, we create an array of files that we want to store in our cache. Remember, we can't store entire folders; we need to specify the files we want to store.

    ```js
    const FILES_TO_CACHE = [
    '/',
    '/index.html',
    '/favicon.ico',
    '/manifest.json',
    '/assets/css/style.css',
    '/assets/js/loadImages.js',
    '/assets/images/icons/icon-72x72.png',
    '/assets/images/icons/icon-96x96.png',
    '/assets/images/icons/icon-128x128.png',
    '/assets/images/icons/icon-144x144.png',
    '/assets/images/1.jpg',
    '/assets/images/2.jpg',
    '/assets/images/3.jpg',
    '/assets/images/4.jpg',
    '/assets/images/5.jpg',
    '/assets/images/6.jpg',
    '/assets/images/7.jpg',
    '/assets/images/8.jpg',
    '/assets/images/9.jpg'
    ];
    ```

    * 🔑 Next, we install the service worker. We open the cache and call `addAll()` to pass in the `FILES_TO_CACHE`. 

    ```js
    self.addEventListener('install', function(evt) {
      evt.waitUntil(
        caches.open(CACHE_NAME).then(cache => {
        console.log('Your files were pre-cached successfully!');
        return cache.addAll(FILES_TO_CACHE);
        })
      );

      self.skipWaiting();
    });
    ```

    * If done correctly, we should see our static cache in our Application tab in Dev Tools.

    * 🔑 Next, we activate the service worker and remove any old data from the cache. 

    ```js
    self.addEventListener('activate', function(evt) {
      evt.waitUntil(
        caches.keys().then(keyList => {
        return Promise.all(
          keyList.map(key => {
            if (key !== CACHE_NAME && key !== DATA_CACHE_NAME) {
                console.log('Removing old cache data', key);
                return caches.delete(key);
              }
            })
          );
        })
      );

      self.clients.claim();
    });
    ```

    * Promises passed into `waitUntil()` will block other events until completion, so the clean-up operation will have completed by the time you get your first fetch event on the new cache.

    * 🔑 Which brings us to the fetch event listener. We attach a fetch event listener to the service worker and then call the `respondWith()` method on the event to intercept the responses. First we will do that for the requests that include `/api` in the URL.

    ```js
    self.addEventListener('fetch', function(evt) {
      if (evt.request.url.includes('/api/')) {
        evt.respondWith(
    ```

    * We will store the responses from the request in the cache so that later we can retrieve them even if we are offline.

    ```js
    caches
      .open(DATA_CACHE_NAME)
      .then(cache => {
        return fetch(evt.request)
          .then(response => {
            // If the response was good, clone it and store it in the cache.
            if (response.status === 200) {
              cache.put(evt.request.url, response.clone());
            }
            return response;
          })
          .catch(err => {
              // Network request failed, try to get it from the cache.
              return cache.match(evt.request);
            });
        })
        .catch(err => console.log(err))
    );
    ```

    * However if the request path does not include `/api/`, then we can assume the request is for a static file.

    ```js
    evt.respondWith(
      fetch(evt.request).catch(function() {
        return caches.match(evt.request).then(function(response) {
          if (response) {
            return response;
          } else if (evt.request.headers.get('accept').includes('text/html')) {
            // return the cached home page for all requests for html pages
            return caches.match('/');
          }
        });
      })
    );
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What does a service worker do?

    * 🙋 A service worker acts as an intermediate step in between an API call and the browser. It can cache files and help provide an offline experience.

    * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

    * We can refer to Lesson 4, read the [MDN Web Docs on Using Service Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API/Using_Service_Workers), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 9. Instructor Demo: Notetaker PWA (5 min) 

* Navigate to `05-Notetaker-PWA/Solved` in your command line and run `npm install` and `npm start` .

* Navigate to <http://localhost:3001> in Chrome and open the Dev Tools to demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 In the Application tab, under Service Workers, we see that the service worker is activated and running.

    * 🔑 We also see the messages "Service Worker registered successfully" and "Your files were pre-cached successfully!" in the console.

    * 🔑 We can add a note and see it listed.

    * 🔑 Now if we go offline and refresh the page, we can still view the notes offline.

    * 🔑 If we check the Cache Storage in the Dev Tools, we can see all of our notes have been cached successfully.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We implemented offline capabilities to the Food Festival app in Lesson 4. We then converted the app into a PWA in Lesson 5.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We will need to incorporate service workers in order for our Budget Tracker to work offline.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We will need to create a `manifest.json` file, `service-worker.js` file, and register the service worker in `index.html`.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 10. Student Do: Notetaker PWA (20 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `05-Notetaker-PWA/README.md`.

```md
# Notetaker PWA

In this activity, you will implement offline functionality to a Notetaker app. You can refer to the previous activities for the code to register, install, and activate the service worker.

## Instructions

* In the [public/](Unsolved/public/) folder, create a `manifest.json` file with the following properties:

  * `name` and `short_name` set to "Notetaker"

  * `icons` set to an array of icons of multiple sizes. You can find all the icons in the [icons](Unsolved/public/assets/images/icons) folder. Be sure to include the `src`, `sizes`, and `type` of each icon.
  
  * `theme_color` and `background_color` set to `#ffffff`
  
  * `start_url` set to `/`
  
  * `display` set to `standalone`

* In the [index.html](Unsolved/public/index.html) file, register the service worker.

  * Refer to the previous activities to get the code for registering a service worker!

* In the [public/](Unsolved/public/) folder, create a `service-worker.js` file and do the following:

  * Name the caches `my-site-cache-v2` and `data-cache-v2` respectively.

  * Add all of the files in the [public/](Unsolved/public) folder to the `FILES_TO_CACHE` array. Don't forget to also include `/`

  * Install and activate the service worker

  * Intercept fetch requests. If the response is successful, we clone it and store it in our cache. If the network request fails, we grab it from our cache.

* If done correctly, create a few notes and you should be able to see all of your notes saved in cache even after going offline.

## Hint(s)

* Refer to the previous activities to help you create the `service-worker.js` file!
```

### 11. Instructor Review: Notetaker PWA  (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ `manifest.json`

    * ✔️ Register service worker

    * ✔️ `service.worker.js`

* Open `05-Notetaker-PWA/Solved/public/manifest.json` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 We need to create a `manifest.json` file in order to convert the app into a PWA

    ```js

    * 🔑 Next, in our `index.html` file, we need to register the service worker.

    ```html
    <script type="text/javascript">
      (function() {
        if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
          navigator.serviceWorker
            .register('./service-worker.js')
            .then(() => console.log('Service Worker registered successfully.'))
            .catch(error =>
              console.log('Service Worker registration failed:', error)
            );
        }
    })();
    </script>
    ```

    * 🔑 Then we create a `service-worker.js` file to cache our files, install and activate the service worker, and intercept fetch requests. First, we set the files we want to cache.

    ```js
    const CACHE_NAME = 'my-site-cache-v2';
    const DATA_CACHE_NAME = 'data-cache-v2';

    const FILES_TO_CACHE = [
    '/',
    '/index.html',
    '/favicon.ico',
    '/manifest.json',
    '/app.js',
    '/assets/css/style.css',
    '/assets/images/icons/icon-72x72.png',
    '/assets/images/icons/icon-96x96.png',
    '/assets/images/icons/icon-128x128.png',
    '/assets/images/icons/icon-144x144.png'
    ];
    ```

    * Then we install the service worker to add all of the specified files to the cache.

    ```js
    self.addEventListener('install', function(evt) {
      evt.waitUntil(
        caches.open(CACHE_NAME).then(cache => {
          console.log('Your files were pre-cached successfully!');
          return cache.addAll(FILES_TO_CACHE);
        })
      );

      self.skipWaiting();
    });
    ```

    * Then, we activate the service worker and remove old data from the cache

    ```js
    self.addEventListener('activate', function(evt) {
      evt.waitUntil(
        caches.keys().then(keyList => {
          return Promise.all(
            keyList.map(key => {
              if (key !== CACHE_NAME && key !== DATA_CACHE_NAME) {
                console.log('Removing old cache data', key);
                return caches.delete(key);
              }
            })
          );
        })
      );
      self.clients.claim();
    });
    ```

    * Finally we intercept the fetch requests accordingly

    ```js
    self.addEventListener('fetch', function(evt) {
    if (evt.request.url.includes('/api/')) {
        evt.respondWith(
        caches
            .open(DATA_CACHE_NAME)
            .then(cache => {
            return fetch(evt.request)
                .then(response => {
                // If the response was good, clone it and store it in the cache.
                if (response.status === 200) {
                    cache.put(evt.request.url, response.clone());
                }

                return response;
                })
                .catch(err => {
                // Network request failed, try to get it from the cache.
                return cache.match(evt.request);
                });
            })
            .catch(err => console.log(err))
        );

        return;
    }

    evt.respondWith(
        fetch(evt.request).catch(function() {
        return caches.match(evt.request).then(function(response) {
            if (response) {
            return response;
            } else if (evt.request.headers.get('accept').includes('text/html')) {
            // return the cached home page for all requests for html pages
            return caches.match('/');
            }
        });
        })
    );
    });
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ When using a service worker, can we send POST requests to an API while offline?

    * 🙋 No, POST/PUT requests must be handled separately. If we wish to "cache" the POST data, we can store it in IndexedDb.

    * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 4 and 5, read the [MDN web docs on PWAs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.
