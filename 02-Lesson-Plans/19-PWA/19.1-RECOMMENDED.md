## Class Instructions 

### 1. Introduction (5 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Direct students to post individual questions in the Zoom chat to be addressed by TAs and/or at the end of class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

    * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back and see what we accomplished, and acknowledge that it's a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic? 

    * 🙋 Let's do "fist to five" together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).


### 2. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* [Click here for CodeSignal challenge](https://app.codesignal.com/public-test/xttcwYyLzN9udSHRm/oEiyqtuFgGaFLj) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Did anyone attempt the Code Signal algorithm?

    * 🙋 It is encouraged to take advantage of the CodeSignal practice because it reflects real-world technical interviewing.

* Open your IDE and review the solution to the Code Signal algorithm:

    * The algorithm is called `missingNumber`. We are given an unsorted array of numbers, `arr`, and we need to figure out which number is missing in the sequence.

    * For `arr = [3, 1, 0]`, the output should be `missingNumber(arr) = 2`.

    * The instructions provide the following details regarding input and output:

    ```md
    [execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)

    [input] array.integer arr

    An unsorted array consisting of different integers from 0 to n inclusive, with only one of them missing.

    Guaranteed constraints:
    1 ≤ arr.length ≤ 1000,
    0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ arr.length.

    [output] integer

    The missing number.
    ```

    * We are also provided the following starter code:

    ```js
    function missingNumber(arr) {

    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝) and call on students for answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What is the first step to solve this problem?

    * 🙋 Sort the array from smallest to largest! To do this we can use: 
    
    ```js
    const sortedArr = arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    ```
    
    * ☝ Yes! This works perfectly. And then what?

    * 🙋 We know that every sequence will start with 0, so we check if this is the case. If it isn't, then 0 is the number we should return:

    ```js
    for (let i = 0; i < sortedArr.length; i++) {

        if(sortedArr[0] !== 0) {
            return 0;
        }

    }
    ```

    * ☝ Exactly. And if 0 already exists, how do we set up the next piece of logic in this loop?

    * 🙋 Let's say we are at position 2, we want to know whether the number at position 3 is an increase of 1 from position 2. If it isn't, then we know there is a number missing! Then we can return that value.

    ```js
    for (let i = 0; i < sortedArr.length; i++) {

        if(sortedArr[0] !== 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        if (sortedArr[i] + 1 !== sortedArr[i + 1]) {
            return sortedArr[i] + 1;
        }
    }
    ```

     * ☝ Excellent work!

* Full solution:

```js
function missingNumber(arr) {

    const sortedArr = arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    for (let i = 0; i < sortedArr.length; i++) {

        if(sortedArr[0] !== 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        if (sortedArr[i] + 1 !== sortedArr[i + 1]) {
            return sortedArr[i] + 1;
        }
    }
}
```

* Answer any questions students have before moving to the next activity.


### 3. Instructor Demo: PWA (5 min) 

* Navigate to [https://secure-bayou-27137.herokuapp.com/](https://secure-bayou-27137.herokuapp.com/) in your Chrome browser and demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 This looks like a regular web application but if we go to Settings and click on Install Images App.., we are able to install it as a desktop app.

    * 🔑 If we search our application, we will find the "Images App" listed among them.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 This whole module was about PWAs and implementing offline functionality. 

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We will create a PWA for our challenge this week. It is a budget tracker that will work offline.

    * ☝️ How would we do this?

    * 🙋 We will use our smart phone to install this web app to our phone.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 4. Student Do: PWA (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-PWA/README.md`.

```md
# Progressive Web Applications (PWA)

* If you currently do not have access to a smart phone, do the following on your computer:

  1. Navigate to [https://secure-bayou-27137.herokuapp.com/](https://secure-bayou-27137.herokuapp.com/) with Chrome.

  2. Open the Settings in Chrome.
  
  3. Click on Install Images App...

  4. At the prompt "Install app?", click Install.

  5. A new Chrome window opens with our application running in it. It is now installed as a desktop app!

* Be prepared to answer the following question(s): 

  * What is a progressive web application? 

  * How do we create progressive web applications?
```


### 5. Instructor Review: PWA (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ Define PWAs

    * ✔️ Describe how we create PWAs

* Navigate to [https://secure-bayou-27137.herokuapp.com/](https://secure-bayou-27137.herokuapp.com/) in your Chrome browser and open Dev Tools to explain the following:

    * ☝️ First, can anyone tell us what exactly a progressive web application is?

    * 🔑 Progressive web applications (PWAs) are mobile or desktop apps delivered through the web, built using HTML, CSS & JavaScript

    * ☝️ What do we need to learn to convert an application into a progressive web application?

    * 🙋 There are three primary things we need to learn: Manifests, Service Workers and the Cache API.

    * 🔑 If we look under the Application tab in DevTools for our Image Gallery App, we see Manifest, Service Workers and Cache Storage panels.

    * If we check the offline button in the Service Workers panel, we see that the application still delivers a full experience without an Internet connection!

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How are PWAs different from native apps?

    * 🙋 Traditional Mobile Apps require multiple builds across platforms, are less discoverable by search engines and have high abandonment rates.They also offer less usability and don’t leverage mobile device capabilities and are often slow and bloated. PWAs provide advantages of both web and mobile apps such as push notifications, offline experiences,speed and stability. Plus, you can convert a web app into a PWA quickly without the build time of a mobile app.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [MDN web docs on PWAs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 6. Instructor Demo: Webpack (5 min) 

* Navigate to `02-Webpack/Solved` in your command line and run `npm run build`. 

* Open `02-Webpack/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 When we check the browser console, we see a message "Hello Webpack!".

* Terminate the process and run `npm run webpack`.

* Open `02-Webpack/Solved/app.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 If we replace "Hello Webpack!" with a different message, we see it changed in the console right away.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used webpack in Lesson 2 to bundle our JavaScript code.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 Webpack won't be used in the challenge, however it was covered in the lessons and knowing webpack can make our production code more efficient. Knowing how to use a build tool is a skill that is in high demand in the job market.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We will need to install webpack, create the `webpack.config.js` file, and change the JavaScript script tag in `index.html` to use the `bundle.js` file instead.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 7. Student Do: Webpack (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Webpack/README.md`.

```md
# Webpack

In this activity, you will create a `bundle.js` file with webpack.

## Instructions

* In the [Unsolved/](Unsolved/) folder, run `npm i -D webpack webpack-cli` in your command line to install webpack.

* Create a file called `webpack.config.js`.

  * Create the main configuration object `module.exports` with 3 properties: `entry`, `output`, and `mode`.
  
    * Set the entry point to be `src/app.js` (pay attention to the relative path).

    * Set the output folder as `/dist` and the bundled code to be in a file called `bundle.js`.

    * Set the mode to be `development` mode.

* In [index.html](Unsolved/index.html), change the JavaScript script tag to use `bundle.js`.

* In [package.json](Unsolved/package.json), add the necessary scripts to run webpack with the `--watch` option as well as without it. 

* To test it out, run webpack without the `--watch` option in your command line, i.e. `npm run build`. Open `index.html` in your browser and check the console to see what message was printed. You should see "Hello Webpack!"

* This time, run webpack with the `--watch` option, i.e. `npm run webpack`. 

* While webpack is running, in [app.js](Unsolved/src/app.js), replace "Hello Webpack!" with a message of your own and save the file.

* Check the browser's console to see the message updated!

* Remember to `CTRL + C` to terminate the `webpack --watch` process.
```

### 8. Instructor Review: Webpack (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ `webpack.config.js`

    * ✔️ JS script tag in `index.html`

    * ✔️ `package.json`

* Open `02-Webpack/Solved/webpack.config.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 We create a `webpack.config.js` file that exports the main configuration object with 3 properties: `entry`, `output`, `mode`.

    ```js
    module.exports = {
      entry: './src/app.js',
      output: {
        path: __dirname + '/dist',
        filename: 'bundle.js'
      },
    mode: 'development'
    };
    ```

    * This created the `bundle.js` file in the `/dist` folder.

* Open `02-Webpack/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 In the `index.html` file, we change the JavaScript script tag right before the `</body>` tag to use `dist/bundle.js` instead of `app.js`

    ```html
    <script type="text/javascript" src="dist/bundle.js"></script>
    ```

* Open `02-Webpack/Solved/package.json` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 Finally we add the scripts to run webpack with and without the `--watch` option.

    ```js
    "scripts": {
        "webpack": "webpack --watch",
        "build": "webpack"
    },
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What does webpack do?

    * 🙋 Webpack is a module bundler. Webpack takes our JavaScript and all of its dependencies and bundles it into a single file.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 2, read the [webpack Getting Started Guide](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 09. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

    * 🙋 We saw how PWAs are different from native apps. We also practiced using webpack to bundle our JavaScript files.

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful. 

    * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

    * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer. 

    * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

    * 🙋 We covered webpack in Lesson 2, and continually cover PWAs throughout this module.

    * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Use student answers to transition to Office Hours.


### 10. Office Hours (30 min)

* Announce Office Hours and invite students to stay on the Zoom and start the challenge while they have live support from instructional staff.
