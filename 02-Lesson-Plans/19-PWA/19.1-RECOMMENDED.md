## Class Instructions 

### 1. Introduction (5 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Direct students to post individual questions in the Zoom chat to be addressed by TAs and/or at the end of class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

    * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back and see what we accomplished, and acknowledge that it's a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic? 

    * 🙋 Let's do "fist to five" together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).


### 2. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* [Click here for CodeSignal challenge](https://app.codesignal.com/public-test/xttcwYyLzN9udSHRm/oEiyqtuFgGaFLj) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Did anyone attempt the Code Signal algorithm?

    * 🙋 It is encouraged to take advantage of the CodeSignal practice because it reflects real-world online interviewing.

* Open your IDE and review the solution to the Code Signal algorithm:

    * The algorithm is called `missingNumber`. We are given an unsorted array of numbers, `arr`, and we need to figure out which number is missing in the sequence.

    * For `arr = [3, 1, 0]`, the output should be `missingNumber(arr) = 2`.

    * The instructions provide the following details regarding input and output:

    ```md
    [execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)

    [input] array.integer arr

    An unsorted array consisting of different integers from 0 to n inclusive, with only one of them missing.

    Guaranteed constraints:
    1 ≤ arr.length ≤ 1000,
    0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ arr.length.

    [output] integer

    The missing number.
    ```

    * We are also provided the following starter code:

    ```js
    function missingNumber(arr) {

    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝) and call on students for answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What is the first step to solve this problem?

    * 🙋 Sort the array from smallest to largest! To do this we can use: 
    
    ```js
    const sortedArr = arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    ```
    
    * ☝ Yes! This works perfectly. And then what?

    * 🙋 We know that every sequence will start with 0, so we check if this is the case. If it isn't, then 0 is the number we should return:

    ```js
    for (let i = 0; i < sortedArr.length; i++) {

        if(sortedArr[0] !== 0) {
            return 0;
        }

    }
    ```

    * ☝ Exactly. And if 0 already exists, how do we set up the next piece of logic in this loop?

    * 🙋 Let's say we are at position 2, we want to know whether the number at position 3 is an increase of 1 from position 2. If it isn't, then we know there is a number missing! Then we can return that value.

    ```js
    for (let i = 0; i < sortedArr.length; i++) {

        if(sortedArr[0] !== 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        if (sortedArr[i] + 1 !== sortedArr[i + 1]) {
            return sortedArr[i] + 1;
        }
    }
    ```

     * ☝Excellent work!

* Full solution:

```js
function missingNumber(arr) {

    const sortedArr = arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    for (let i = 0; i < sortedArr.length; i++) {

        if(sortedArr[0] !== 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        if (sortedArr[i] + 1 !== sortedArr[i + 1]) {
            return sortedArr[i] + 1;
        }
    }
}
```

* Answer any questions students have before moving to the next activity.
