# Module 19 Instructor Overview: Progressive Web Applications (PWA)

## Overview

In this week's virtual classes, you'll go over PWAs, mainly webpack and service workers.

## Virtual Classes

[Recommended Class](./19.1-RECOMMENDED.md)

[Required Class](./19.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* This last phase of the boot camp is more about being employer-ready, improving the skills they have already learned, and making their web applications more performant and efficient. Basically, students will focus on "Life after Boot Camp". 

* Webpack was introduced in Lesson 2 but will not be required for the Challenge. Service workers were introduced in Lesson 4.

## Module Challenge

[Module 19 Challenge](../../01-Class-Content/19-PWA/02-Challenge)

## Heads-Up

* Next week, students will learn about React. Students may feel a little overwhelmed with the new unusual syntax. Remind them that at the end of the day, we're still just working with JavaScript. Prioritize making sure they understand concepts, rather than worrying about them perfectly memorizing syntax.
