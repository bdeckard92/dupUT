**Reminder:** If students need help with an async activity, encourage them to attend Office Hours for help! If you can’t get through all of it, remind them that they can lean on Learning Assistants with the AskBCS bot for more help.

## Virtual Classes

If your class started AFTER January 1, 2021, use these lesson plans:

* [Virtual Class 19.1](./19.1-REQUIRED.md)

* [Virtual Class 19.2](./19.2-REQUIRED.md)

If your class started BEFORE January 1, 2021, use these lesson plans:

* [Virtual Class (Recommended) 19.1](./19.1-RECOMMENDED.md)

* [Virtual Class (Required) 19.2](./19.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* This last phase of the boot camp is more about being employer-ready, improving the skills they have already learned, and making their web applications more performant and efficient. Basically, students will focus on "Life after Boot Camp". 

* Progressive web apps aim to blend the benefits of a traditional browser experience with those of a mobile application. For an overview on the PWA design pattern see [MDN Web Docs on Progressive Web Apps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps).

* Let students know that we won't be able to teach them every aspect of Progressive Web Applications in the amount of time allotted. Instead, help students understand PWAs as a valuable design pattern that emphasizes measuring and optimizing the performance of web application and encourage students to further explore the concepts introduced when developing apps on their own.

### Common Pain Points

According to our class data, students might experience some of the following pain points throughout the week:

@TODO FILL OUT CHART BY LISTING 2-4 PAIN POINTS AND SOLUTIONS

| Pain Point                          | Recommendation       |
| ---                                 | ---                  |
| {COMMON PAIN POINT FOR THIS MODULE} | {RECOMMENDED ACTION} |
| {COMMON PAIN POINT FOR THIS MODULE} | {RECOMMENDED ACTION} |

## Career Connection

During each lesson that students work through, they will also view a Career Connection section that will tie together the academic content with Career Services and how this material will be applicable to them in their future career.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Director and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careerservicesonlineevents.splashthat.com/).

If you'd like more information on Career Services, visit the [Career Services resources page](https://mycareerspot.org/).

## Module Challenge

In this week's Challenge assignment, students will convert an existing budget tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality, so that users can log expenses and deposits to their budget with or without an internet connection.

[Module 19 Challenge](../../01-Class-Content/19-PWA/02-Challenge)

Specific skills students will need to implement in order to be successful:

* Use service workers to cache assets for offline functionality.

* Convert an existing web application to a PWA.

* Add a web manifest to your application.

## Heads-Up

Next week, students will learn about [React](https://reactjs.org/), a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Students may feel a little overwhelmed with the new, unusual syntax. Remind them that at the end of the day, we're still just working with JavaScript. Prioritize making sure they understand concepts, rather than worrying about them perfectly memorizing syntax.
