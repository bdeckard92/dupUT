## Class Instructions 

### 1. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Invite students to post questions in the Zoom chat so TAs and/or the instructor can address them at the end of class.

* Open the lesson's [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mgyA1oflkdedI0NfTkh-fHyhjNnKsWl-jMRiaQmARU0/edit?usp=sharing) and walk through the following slides on foundation setting: 

    **Big Picture**: This is an opportunity to look at the big picture of where students are in the course. Take a moment to discuss a few real-world examples of why this week's topics are valuable.

    **Boot Camp Pointers**: Review some logistics that will help students stay on track. This is an opportunity to speak to what students might need at this particular point in the course. 

    **This Week**: Review the key skills students will be learning this week. 

    **This Week's Assignment**: Give a quick summary of this week's Challenge assignment and describe how the skills they learn throughout the week will be applied to it.

    **Career Connection**: Reinforce that students will use the skills they learn this week throughout their careers. It's important for them to know the "why" and "how" behind the "what." Give examples of how these skills are used on the job. If you feel comfortable, share examples of how you have used them in your professional career.

    * This week, students will learn about Progressive Web Applications (PWA). Ask the class how many of them would like to work for companies that develop applications for a global audience. You'll probably get a decent amount of students that respond yes.

    * Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

        * ☝️ If we're developing applications for a global audience, what are some things we need to think about?

        * 🙋 Not everybody has access to the same level of internet. For example, in some developing countries, speeds might be the equivalent of 3G or slower. Additionally, access via a desktop or laptop computer might be limited, with consumers of your application using only mobile devices like phones and tablets to access the Internet.

        * ☝️ And what does that mean for us? Why do we need to think about that?

        * 🙋 We need to develop applications that are accessible to a wide range of audiences, for those on different devices as well as those who have different connectivity levels. Progressive Web Applications, or PWAs, are just one way to reach an audience with slower internet speeds than those we might be accustomed to.

    * Let students know that PWAs play an important role in developing applications for a global audience. Even in countries with faster internet speeds, there are times when connectivity is low (e.g., in rural areas or on an underground train). Thus, PWAs provide huge benefits and can bring a lot of value to a future employer.

    **How to Succeed This Week**: Remind students that they might experience moments of frustration as they learn complex concepts and tools, and that these times are actually proven opportunities to deepen knowledge. Consider sharing something about your personal learning journey. This helps students recognize that everyone starts somewhere and that they are not alone.

    **Today's Objectives**: Outline the concepts that will be covered in today's lesson. Remind students that they can find the relevant activity files in the "Getting Ready for Class" page in their course content. 

### 2. Instructor Do: Student Check-In (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

  * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back at what we've accomplished and acknowledge that it is a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed&mdash;as long as you don’t give up.

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic?

  * 🙋 Let's do Fist to Five together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 3. Instructor Demo: PWA (5 min) 

* In Chrome, navigate to [https://image-gallery-cache.herokuapp.com/](https://image-gallery-cache.herokuapp.com/) and demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 This looks like a regular web application, but if we go to Settings and click "Install Images App", we can install it as a desktop app.

    * 🔑 If we search our applications, we will find the "Images App" listed among them.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 This entire module was about PWAs and implementing offline functionality. 

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

    * 🙋 We will create a budget tracker PWA that will work offline for our Challenge this week.

    * ☝️ How would we do this?

    * 🙋 We will use our smartphone to install this web app on our phone.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: PWA (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-PWA/README.md`, which are also shown here:

     ```md
     # Progressive Web Applications (PWA)

     In this activity, you will install a progressive web application (PWA) using your smart phone. You will also research the definition and production of a PWA. 

     ## Instructions

     * Follow these instructions to install a PWA for your specific smartphone OS:

     * iOs:

         1. Navigate to [https://image-gallery-cache.herokuapp.com/](https://image-gallery-cache.herokuapp.com/) with Safari.

         2. Tap the Share button in Safari.

         3. Tap the icon labeled Add to Home Screen.

         4. Name your PWA, then tap Add in the upper-right corner.

         5. Check your Home Screen to see the app.

     * Android:

         1. Navigate to [https://image-gallery-cache.herokuapp.com/](https://image-gallery-cache.herokuapp.com/) with Chrome.

         2. Tap the menu button in the upper right corner of Chrome.

         3. Tap the icon labeled Add to Home Screen.

         4. Name your PWA, then tap Add below the prompt.

         5. If there is an additional prompt asking "Add to Home screen?", tap Add.

         6. Check your Home Screen to see the app.

     * If you currently do not have access to a smart phone, do the following on your computer:

         1. Navigate to [https://image-gallery-cache.herokuapp.com/](https://image-gallery-cache.herokuapp.com/) with Chrome.

         2. Open the Settings in Chrome.
  
         3. Click on Install Images App...

         4. At the prompt "Install app?", click Install.

         5. A new Chrome window opens with our application running in it. It is now installed as a desktop app!

     * Be prepared to answer the following question(s): 

       * What is a progressive web application? 

       * How do we create progressive web applications?
     ```

### 5. Instructor Review: PWA (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points (:key:) below to review the following key points (✔️):

    * ✔️ Define PWAs

    * ✔️ Describe how we create PWAs

* Navigate to [https://image-gallery-cache.herokuapp.com/](https://image-gallery-cache.herokuapp.com/) in your Chrome browser and open Dev Tools to explain the following:

    * ☝️ First, can anyone tell us what exactly a progressive web application is?

    * 🔑 Progressive web applications (PWAs) are mobile or desktop apps delivered through the web, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

    * ☝️ What do we need to learn to convert an application into a progressive web application?

    * 🙋 There are three primary things we need to learn: Manifests, Service Workers, and the Cache API.

    * 🔑 If we look under the Application tab in DevTools for our Image Gallery App, we see Manifest, Service Workers, and Cache Storage panels.

    * If we check the offline button in the Service Workers panel, we see that the application still delivers a full experience without an internet connection!

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How are PWAs different from native apps?

    * 🙋 Traditional mobile apps require multiple builds across platforms, are less discoverable by search engines, and have high abandonment rates. They also offer less usability, don’t leverage mobile device capabilities, and are often slow and bloated. PWAs provide advantages of both web and mobile apps, including push notifications, offline experiences, speed, and stability. Plus, you can convert a web app into a PWA quickly without the build time of a mobile app.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to the lessons, read the [MDN Web Docs on PWAs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps), and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Webpack (5 min) 

* Navigate to `02-Webpack/Solved` in your command line and run `npm run build`. 

* Open `02-Webpack/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 When we check the browser console, we see a message "Hello Webpack!".

* Terminate the process and run `npm run webpack`.

* Open `02-Webpack/Solved/app.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 If we replace "Hello Webpack!" with a different message, we see it changed in the console right away.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used Webpack in Lesson 2 to bundle our JavaScript code.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

    * 🙋 Webpack won't be used in the Challenge, but it was covered in the lessons and knowing Webpack can make our production code more efficient. Knowing how to use a build tool is a skill that is in high demand in the job market.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We need to install Webpack, create the `webpack.config.js` file, and change the JavaScript script tag in `index.html` to use the `bundle.js` file instead.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Webpack (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Webpack/README.md`, which are also shown here:

     ```md
     # Webpack

     In this activity, you will create a `bundle.js` file with Webpack.

     ## Instructions

     * In the [Unsolved/](Unsolved/) folder, run `npm i -D webpack webpack-cli` in your command line to install Webpack.

     * Create a file called `webpack.config.js`.

         * Create the main configuration object `module.exports` with 3 properties: `entry`, `output`, and `mode`.
  
         * Set the entry point to be `src/app.js` (pay attention to the relative path).

         * Set the output folder as `/dist` and the bundled code to be in a file called `bundle.js`.

         * Set the mode to be `development` mode.

     * In [index.html](Unsolved/index.html), change the JavaScript script tag to use `bundle.js`.

     * In [package.json](Unsolved/package.json), add the necessary scripts to run Webpack with the `--watch` option as well as without it. 

     * To test it out, run Webpack without the `--watch` option in your command line, i.e. `npm run build`. Open `index.html` in your browser and check the console to see what message was printed. You should see "Hello Webpack!"

     * This time, run Webpack with the `--watch` option, i.e. `npm run webpack`. 

     * While Webpack is running, in [app.js](Unsolved/src/app.js), replace "Hello Webpack!" with a message of your own and save the file.

     * Check the browser's console to see the message updated!

     * Remember to `CTRL + C` to terminate the `webpack --watch` process.
     ```

### 8. Instructor Review: Webpack (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points (:key:) below to review the following key points (✔️):

    * ✔️ `webpack.config.js`

    * ✔️ JS script tag in `index.html`

    * ✔️ `package.json`

* Open `02-Webpack/Solved/webpack.config.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 We create a `webpack.config.js` file that exports the main configuration object with three properties: `entry`, `output`, `mode`.

         ```js
         module.exports = {
           entry: './src/app.js',
           output: {
             path: __dirname + '/dist',
             filename: 'bundle.js'
           },
         mode: 'development'
         };
         ```

    * This created the `bundle.js` file in the `/dist` folder.

* Open `02-Webpack/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 In the `index.html` file, we change the JavaScript script tag right before the `</body>` tag to use `dist/bundle.js` instead of `app.js`

         ```html
         <script type="text/javascript" src="dist/bundle.js"></script>
         ```

* Open `02-Webpack/Solved/package.json` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 Finally, we add the scripts to run Webpack with and without the `--watch` option.

         ```js
         "scripts": {
             "webpack": "webpack --watch",
             "build": "webpack"
         },
         ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What does Webpack do?

    * 🙋 Webpack is a module bundler. Webpack takes JavaScript and all of its dependencies and bundles it into a single file.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 2, read the [Webpack Getting Started Guide](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/), and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

    * 🙋 We saw how PWAs are different from native apps. We also practiced using Webpack to bundle our JavaScript files.

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful. 

    * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

    * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the Challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer. 

    * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

    * 🙋 We covered Webpack in Lesson 2, and continually cover PWAs throughout this module.

    * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Use student answers to transition to Office Hours.

### 10. Office Hours (30 min)

* Announce Office Hours and invite students to stay on the Zoom and start the Challenge while they have live support from instructional staff.
