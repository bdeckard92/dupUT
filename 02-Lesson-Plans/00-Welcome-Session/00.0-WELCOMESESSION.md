# Lesson Plan: Welcome Session

## Overview 

Welcome to the Boot Camp! During this session, students will be receiving Onboarding information from their Student Success Manager (SSM) and will complete introduction activities in the second half of the class. 

## Instructor Notes

* The SSM will handle the first half of class, but you will take over with an activity for the second half, after the SSM explains Add/Drop dates and opens the floor for questions. You can share your screen for demonstrations at this time.

* In this lesson, students will complete Systems Checks and GitHub activities.

* Some students may not have all their installations complete prior to the Welcome Session. Assure them that they can follow along with any activities they cannot complete, and encourage them to prioritize office hours to ensure they can complete their system setup with an instructional staff member. 

* This will be the first time many students see or use the terminal or GitHub. Make sure to repeat explanations and take into account that MacOS and Windows machines have slightly different commands.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Explain virtual class best practices including Slack and Zoom etiquette

* Demonstrate how to successfully navigate their boot camp portal

* Explain and locate career services that are available to them

* Explain the graduation requirements for this boot camp

* Create, clone, and alter a new repository using GitHub and the terminal

## Class Instruction

### 1. SSM Do: Welcome Deck Slides 

* The SSM for your class will lead the first portion of the Welcome Session by reviewing slides with relevant Orientation material for students covering graduation requirements, class expectations, and accessing relevant boot camp material. 

### 2. Instructor Do: Systems Checks 

* Review the following list of tools/platforms with students. Ask them to verify with a thumbs up or a chat message when they have confirmed they have the tools installed and/or accounts created:  

  * ✔️ LinkedIn
        
  * ✔️ GitHub

  * ✔️ Slack Desktop

  * ✔️ VSCode & Open in Browser Extension 

  * ✔️ Google Chrome

  * ✔️ (Windows Only) GitBash

  * ✔️ (MacOS Only) XCode & Homebrew

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

  * ☝️ What should you do if you still need help with installations? 

  * 🙋 We should attend office hours to get help from an instructional staff member.

### 3. Everyone Do: GitHub Activity  

* Share your screen and use the following prompts and talking points to demonstrate the following key point(s):

  * ✔️ Navigating to the GitHub website
      
  * ✔️ Creating a new repository using the GUI

  * ✔️ Navigating in the terminal using `cd`, `ls`, and `pwd`

  * ✔️ Cloning a repository using the `git clone` command

  * ✔️ Creating a new file in the terminal using the `touch` command

  * ✔️ Pushing changes to the GitHub repository using the `git status`, `git add .`, `git commit -m "message"`, and `git push origin main` commands

Ask the class to follow along with each step of the process as you guide them through this activity. Elaborate on each step as you demonstrate, ensuring students get a couple of opportunities to hear definitions and explanations of commands and concepts along the way.  

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

  * ☝️ Why do we use `git status` when working with GitHub repositories? 

  * 🙋 It lets us know what files have been updated, what branch we are currently on, and whether or not it is up to date. 

### 4. Instructor Do: Wrap Up 

* Use the prompts below to reminds students of the following outstanding tasks for them to complete:

  * ✔️ Review the Welcome Session Recap email you will recieve tomorrow, send by the SSM containing a Slack invitation, class recording, and slide deck
  	
  * ✔️ Get started with the Onboarding Survey and Module 1 lessons on Bootcamp Spot
  
  * ✔️ Attend Install Weekend with your TAs
  
  * ✔️ Come to your Virtual Classes next week!
