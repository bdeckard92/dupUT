# Module 05 Required Session Lesson Plan: Third-party APIs

## Overview 

This session reviews Bootstrap and jQuery basics. Students will use the Bootstrap grid layout and components to quickly scaffold a UI, as well as handle events with jQuery methods. Students will also build a "to do list" application that is very similar to their challenge assignment. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Explain and implement libraries with content delivery networks and static files 

* Perform DOM traversals and manipulations with jQuery

* Explain how to resolve issues related to dynamically generated HTML using jQuery

* Explain and implement the Bootstrap grid layout in HTML

* Integrate Bootstrap components in HTML files to quickly build user interfaces


## Preparing For Class/Instructor Notes 

* When reviewing activities, ask for volunteers to share their solutions and/or ask students to walk through the solution, line-by-line.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, share your struggle and/or personal experiences learning and working with the concepts covered in this lesson.

* Ensure that you are using the correct versions of jQuery and Bootstrap (v4).

* Students will find `this` challenging. Review the `03-jQuery-Todo-localStorage` activity prior to class and be preapred to discuss `this`.

* @TODO reference(s) to async

* Remind TAs to post on Slack the Friday morning before, with a quick message reminding students about the upcoming Saturday session.


## Pre-Class Activity/Warm-Up 

Encourage students to work on the remaining module algorithm(s) during office hours. Offer to review the algorithm(s) 5 or 10 minutes before class begins or during office hours after class.

### 1. Icebreaker Activity (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

    * ☝️ What did we learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

    * 🙋 We learned how to use third-party APIs, such as Bootstrap, jQuery and Moment.js. We are moving fast compared to traditional learners. It’s ok to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ Did anyone have an 'ah-ha' moment this week? When and why did it click? 

    * 🙋 Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we are thinking about the problem.

    * ☝️ Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

    * 🙋 It's easy to get stuck when you're learning web development. It's important to learn how get unstuck because it happens to the pros, too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups are a great because explaining your problems to someone else often reveals their solution. 


### 2. Instructor Do: Introduce Challenge (5 min)

* Open `/02-Challenge/Master/index.html` in your browser and explain the following:

    * This weeks challenge is a "Work Day Scheduler". It allows us to enter tasks in hour-long increments over a 9AM to 5PM day. It also presents the user with the date and highlights the hour based on the users location.

    * If we enter a task in one of the hour rows, we can edit it later.

    * If we click the corresponding "save" button, the task will be stored in `localStorage`. 

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

    * ☝️ What recently acquired skills will help us build this challenge?

    * 🙋 We can use Bootstrap for the layout and style; jQuery for the functionality; and Moment.js for the time stamp and highlights.

    * ☝️ How are these skills relevant to a career in web development?

    * 🙋 Libraries and frameworks are widely used in both legacy and greenfield projects to leverage the work of others to quickly build, deploy and maintain our applications. 

    * ☝️ How will this challenge improve your portfolio?

    * 🙋 This challenge will demonstrate knowledge of Bootstrap, jQuery, and Moment.js, three commonly used third-party APIs.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 3. Instructor Demo: Bootstrap Card Layout (5 min) 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to demonstrate the following key point(s):

    * ✔️ Bootstrap components

    * ✔️ Responsive grid layout

* Open `/01-CardLayout/Solved/index.html` in your browser and explain the following:

    * This simple site uses the Bootstrap grid layout and several common components. 

    @TODO insert image

    * If we resize the browser, or `Toggle device toolbar` in Devtools, we see that the grid layout responds accordingly.

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 @TODO We used this to accomplish { x, y, z }, in { corresponding asynchronous lesson plan }.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 It provides practice in reading documentation, designing a layout, and quickly building user interfaces with Bootstrap. 

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We could start by making a sketch of the grid layout, then consult the Bootstrap documentation for components. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 4. Student Do: Bootstrap Card Layout Activity (10 or 15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `/01-Bootstrap-Card-Layout`.

```md
    # Bootstrap Card Layout

    In this activity, you will use the Bootstrap grid layout and components to quickly build a user interface.


    ## Instructions

    * Using Bootstrap, build a page from scratch according to the design in the image below.

    ![Card-layout design](card-layout.png)


    ## Hint(s)

    * Refer to the [Bootstrap 4 documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/)
```


### 5. Instructor Review: Bootstrap Card Layout (5 or 10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to demonstrate the following key point(s):

    * ✔️ Adding Bootstrap to HTML with a CDN

    * ✔️ Implementing a row / column layout with Bootstrap

    * ✔️ Consulting the Bootstrap documentation for components

* Open `/01-Bootstrap-Card-Layout/index.html` in your browser and explain the following:

    * 🔑 We import Bootstrap using the CDN in the `<head>` of our `index.html` file. 

    ```html
    <head>

    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

    <title>Bootstrap Card Layout Activity</title>

    <!-- Bootstrap CDN -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css">

    </head>
    ```

    * 🔑 We then add a **nav** component in the `<body>` of our document. 

    ```html
    <body>
    <!-- Start Nav -->
    <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-dark bg-dark">
        <span class="navbar-brand mb-1 h1">Navbar</span>
        <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#navbarSupportedContent"
        aria-controls="navbarSupportedContent" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
        <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
        </button>
        <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarSupportedContent">
        <ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right">
            <li class="nav-item">
            <a class="nav-link" href="#">About</a>
            </li>
            <li class="nav-item">
            <a class="nav-link" href="#">Portfolio</a>
            </li>
            <li class="nav-item">
            <a class="nav-link" href="#">Contact</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        </div>
    </nav>
    <!-- End Nav -->
    ```

    * ☝️ Did we write this component?

    * 🙋 We could, but we can also copy/paste it from the [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/navs/)

    * We next create a `<div>` element with a `container` class.

    ```html
    <div class="container">
    ```

    * ☝️ Why did we place this below the `<nav>` element and not at the top of our `<body>`?

    * 🙋 We want our nav to span the width of the page. The container class will "contain" our content to a fixed width.

    * 🔑 Within our container div, we create our first row, and within that a column with a width of 8.

    ```html
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-8">
          ...
        </div>
    ```

    * Within our first column, we add our `<h1>` element and another row.

    ```html
    <h1>About Me</h1>
        <div class="row">
    ```

     * ☝️ Why did we place this new row below our `<h1>`?

    * 🙋 We want our header to span the width of our container.

    * 🔑 Within this new row, we add two columns with widths of 3 and 9, respectively. 

    ```html
    <div class="col-md-3">
        <img src="http://placehold.it/150x150" alt="Placeholder" class="img-thumbnail">
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-9">
        <p>
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Quisque dignissim, felis ut dictum tristique,
            nibh erat feugiat libero, sit amet fringilla mauris velit in mi. Duis tempus felis vitae
            felis vulputate pretium. Nullam commodo, est ac auctor ornare, eros nisi fringilla sem,
            non pulvinar tortor lorem sit amet sem. Aenean quis erat facilisis, porttitor ex cursus,
            luctus enim. Curabitur et metus in lacus tristique sagittis et in lorem. Nunc id nisi et
            neque fringilla ultricies. Aenean at feugiat elit, a posuere justo. Pellentesque egestas
            dolor et nisi venenatis, nec fermentum urna fringilla. Etiam efficitur porta purus, id
            posuere sem congue a.
        </p>
    </div>
    ```

     * ☝️ Why did we choose widths of 3 and 9?

    * 🙋 The Bootstrap grid layout is based on 12 units. 

    * To finish our layout, we add a new column with a width of 4.

    ```html
    <div class="col-md-4">
        ...
    </div>
      ```

    * ☝️ Why did we choose a width of 4?

    * 🙋 We assigned our first column a width of 8.

    * 🔑 Within our new column, we add a card component. 

    ```html
    <div class="card mt-2">
          <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title">Card title</h5>
            <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Card subtitle</h6>
            <p class="card-text">Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.</p>
         </div>
    </div>
    ```

    * ☝️ Did we write this component?

    * 🙋 We could, but we can also copy/paste it from the [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/card/) 

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

    * ☝️ When is it okay to copy / paste code?

    * 🙋 When it is publicly available in the official documentation for a library or framework and/or the license allows you to do so.

    * ☝️ When is it not okay to copy / paste code?

    * 🙋 When it is under copyright or a restrictive license. It's also not okay to copypasta code from someone elses project and submit it as your own for grading!

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understanding this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [Introduction to Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 6. Instructor Demo: jQuery Sandwich Click (5 or 10 min) 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to demonstrate the following key point(s):

    * ✔️ Using state variables

    * ✔️ Handling events with jQuery `.on()`

    * ✔️ Setting HTML contents with jQuery `.html()`
    
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======

>>>>>>> 8dd92c763c7c008ca99283159e14625c907e08dc
* Open `/02-JQuery-Sandwich-Click/Solved/index.html` in your browser and explain the following:

    * When we click one of the sandwich buttons, we are presented with two alerts: the first with a witty comment about the sandwich; the second a count of the number of sandiwches eaten. 

    * When we resolve the alerts, an image of the sandwich is rendered in the browser. 

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 @TODO We used this to accomplish { x, y, z }, in { corresponding asynchronous lesson plan }.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We are reviewing how to handle events, work with state variables and dynamically render HTML.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We first need to scaffold our application with HTML, including three buttons and an element to hold dynamically generated content. We then need to set up event handlers to listen for clicks and respond to those clicks with alert messages and an image.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 7. Student Do: jQuery Sandwich Click (10 or 15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `/`.

```md
    # jQuery Sandwich Click

    In this activity, you will build an interactive application that tracks state and handles events.

    ## Instructions

    * From scratch, create a simple jQuery application with the following functionality:

        * Renders three buttons, each referencing a different type of sandwich. 

        * When a button is clicked, a first alert displays a witty statement about the specific sandwich.
        
        * When the first alert is resolved, a second alert message displays the number of that specific sandwich the user has eaten.

    ## Hint(s)

    You will need to use global variables to track state.

    ## BONUS

    Render an image for each click event.
```


### 8. Instructor Review: jQuery Sandwich Click (5 or 10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key point(s):

    * ✔️ Using state variables

    * ✔️ Handling events with jQuery `.on()`

    * ✔️ Setting HTML contents with jQuery `.html()`

* Open `/02-JQuery-Sandwich-Click/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

    * We create three `<button>` elements, each with an `id` and corresponding content for our sandwiches.

    ```html
    <button id="pbj">Peanut Butter Jelly</button>
	<button id="grilledcheese">Grilled Cheese</button>
    <button id="roastbeef">Roast Beef</button>
    ```

    * We declare an empty `<div>` with an id of `#image-div`.

    ```html
    	<div id="image-div"></div>
    ```

    * ☝️ What is the purpose of this empty `<div>`?

    * 🙋 We will render images in it.

    * 🔑 In our `<script>` tag we declare three global state variables to count the number of sandwiches eaten.

    ```js
    var pbjCounter = 0;
    var grilledCheeseCounter = 0;
    var roastBeefCounter = 0;
    ```

    * 🔑 We declare three `.on()` methods, each listening for `click` events on a sandwich button, using the corresponding `id`.

    ```js
    $("#pbj").on("click", function() {
      
      alert("Mmm... Peanut Butter Jelly Time.");
      pbjCounter++;
      alert("You've eaten " + pbjCounter + " PB&J sandwiches");
      
      // BONUS
      $("#image-div").html("<img src='https://i1.wp.com/snotapwi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/PBJ-Sandwiches.jpg?resize=590%2C368&ssl=1' />");
      
    });
    ```

    * 📝 Within our `on()` methods, we use the increment operator to increase the sandwich count.

    * 🔑 The image is rendered using the `html()` method on the `<div>` with the id of `#image-div`. We set the `src` of the image to an external, third-party URL.

    * Lastly, we add jQuery to our document using another `<script>` tag below the first. 

    ```html
      <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
    ```

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

    * ☝️ Why do we add our JavaScript (and jQuery files) at the bottom of the `<body>` element?

    * 🙋 To prevent our script from running before the DOM renders.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understanding this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [jQuery `on()`](https://api.jquery.com/on/) and [jQuery `html()`](https://api.jquery.com/html/) documentation, and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 9. Instructor Demo: jQuery To-do List with localStorage (5 min) 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to demonstrate the following key point(s):

    * ✔️ Getting form values with jQuery

    * ✔️ Dynamically generating HTML with jQuery

    * ✔️ Setting and getting items in localStorage

* Open `/03-jQuery-ToDo-localStorage/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

    * We add items to our to-do list through a form field. Clicking the `Add item` button adds them both to the list rendered in the DOM and to `localStorage`.

    * If we inspect Local Storage in the Application tab in DevTools, we will see the items we added.

    * We can delete items from the list using the button prepended to each list item.

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 @TODO We used this to accomplish { x, y, z }, in { corresponding asynchronous lesson plan }.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 Getting form values with jQuery, and getting and setting items in `localStorage`. 

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We would start by scaffolding our HTML, then pseudocode our script functionality to listen for click events on the button, get the value in the form field, store the value in `localStorage`, get items from `localStorage` and render those items to the DOM.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 10. Student Do: jQuery To-do List with localStorage (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `/03-jQuery-ToDo-localStorage`.

```md
    # jQuery To-do List with localStorage

    In this activity you will add persistent storage to a "To-do list" application. 

    ## Instructions

    Using the starter code in `/Unsolved`, ensure the following functionality:

    * Items are added to the list through the form field. 

    * Clicking the `Add item` button on the form sets the item in `localStorage`.

    * Items in `localStorage` are rendered below the form field. 

    * Items are removed from the DOM and `localStorage` when the "✓" button is clicked.


    ## Hint(s)

    * You will need to create an array to hold list items.

    * How do you check to see if items already exist in `localStorage`? If not, then what?

    * You will need to selectively delete array elements using `.splice`. 
```


### 11. Instructor Review: jQuery To-do List with localStorage (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to demonstrate the following key point(s):

    * ✔️ Getting form values with jQuery

    * ✔️ Dynamically generating HTML with jQuery

    * ✔️ Setting and getting items in localStorage

* Open `/03-jQuery-ToDo-localStorage/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

    * 🔑 We declare a `list` variable and set the value of `list` to the parsed contents retrieved from `localStorage` use the `.getItem()` method. But, if  there is nothing in `localStorage`, we use the OR operator to set the value of `list` to an empty array.

    ```js
    var list = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("todolist")) || [];
    ```

    * We declare a `renderTodos()` function. Our function accepts a `list` argument, iterates over that list, and for each item in the list, creates a `<p> element prepended with a `<button>` element.

    ```js
    function renderTodos(list) {
        $("#to-dos").empty(); // empties out the html

        // render our todos to the page
        for (var i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
          // Create a new variable that will hold a "<p>" tag.
          // Then set the to-do "value" as text to this <p> element.
          var toDoItem = $("<p>");
          toDoItem.text(list[i]);

          // Create a button with unique identifiers based on what number it is in the list. Again use jQuery to do this.
          // Give your button a data attribute called data-to-do and a class called "checkbox".
          // Lastly add a checkmark inside.

          var toDoClose = $("<button>");

          toDoClose.attr("data-to-do", i);
          toDoClose.addClass("checkbox");
          toDoClose.text("✓");

          // Append the button to the to do item
          toDoItem = toDoItem.prepend(toDoClose);

          // Add the button and to do item to the to-dos div
          $("#to-dos").append(toDoItem);
        }
      }
      ```

    * ☝️ What is the purpose of `$("#to-dos").empty();`?

    * 🙋 It clears the `#to-dos` `<div>`. If we didn't call the `empty()` method, our list would be appended to the `#to-dos` `<div>` every time we opened or refreshed our page resulting in a redundant, messy interface.

    * 🔑 We add an event handler to the `#add-to-do` form using `.on()`. When our application "hears" a `"click"` on the form `<input>`, the value in the form field is assigned to a variable, `toDoTask`. `toDoTask` is then pushed to the `list` array and passed to our `renderTodos` function. 

      ```js
        $("#add-to-do").on("click", function(event) {
        event.preventDefault();

        // Get the to-do "value" from the textbox and store it as a variable
        var toDoTask = $("#to-do")
          .val()
          .trim();

        // Adding our new todo to our local list variable and adding it to local storage
        list.push(toDoTask);

        // Update the todos on the page
        renderTodos(list);

        // Save the todos into localstorage.
        // We need to use JSON.stringify to turn the list from an array into a string
        localStorage.setItem("todolist", JSON.stringify(list));

        // Clear the textbox when done
        $("#to-do").val("");
      });
      ```

    * 🔑 We update `localStorage` with the new `list` array using the `setItem` method and `JSON.stringify()`. 

    * 🔑 Because our checkbox buttons were dynamically generated, we apply our `on()` event handler to the `document` to listen for a `"click"` on any element with a class of `.checkbox`.

      ```js
      $(document).on("click", ".checkbox", function() {
        // Get the number of the button from its data attribute and hold in a variable called  toDoNumber.
        var toDoNumber = $(this).attr("data-to-do");

        // Deletes the item marked for deletion
        list.splice(toDoNumber, 1);

        // Update the todos on the page
        renderTodos(list);

        // Save the todos into localstorage.
        // We need to use JSON.stringify to turn the list from an array into a string
        localStorage.setItem("todolist", JSON.stringify(list));
      });
      ```
    
    * 🔑 Using `this`, we assign the value stored in the `"data-to-do"` attribute in a `toDoNumber` variable. We then splice `toDoNumber` out of the `list` and call `renderTodos()` with our updated `list`. 
    
    * Lastly, we call our `renderTodos()` function and pass it our `list` to set everything in motion.

    ```js
    renderTodos(list);
    ```

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

    * ☝️ Why do we add the event handler to the document?

    * 🙋 The buttons did not exist before the DOM was rendered so we can't specificy what element to listen to in advance.

    * ☝️ What is `this`?

    * 🙋 `this` refers to the function invoked by the `click` event.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understanding this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to the lesson plan, read [`this` MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this),[data-attributes MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/data-*), and [jQuery `.on()` documentation](https://api.jquery.com/on/) and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### XX. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

    * ☝️ What do you think you absolutely need to know to succeed at the challenge?

    * 🙋 To succeed at the challenge, we need to know how to build user interfaces using Bootstrap components with grid layout.
