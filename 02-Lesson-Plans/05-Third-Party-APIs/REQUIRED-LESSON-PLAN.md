# Module 05 Lesson Plan: Third-party APIs

## Overview 

@TODO
Two to four sentences describing what’s in this lesson and its relevance both to the preceding asynchronous content and to the upcoming challenge. Outline the 3-4  key topics that will be drawn from the asynchronous content and reinforced in this lesson for use in the upcoming challenge so that instructors understand how the pieces fit together. 


## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

@TODO
* Explain the difference between jQuery and JavaScript

* Explain the difference between CSS and Bootstrap

* Explain and implement libraries with content delivery networks and static files 

* Perform DOM traversals and manipulations with jQuery

* Explain how to resolve issues related to dynamically generated HTML using jQuery

* Explain and implement the Bootstrap grid layout in HTML

* Integrate Bootstrap components in HTML files to quickly build user interfaces


## Preparing For Class/Instructor Notes 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the prompts and talking points for review. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, share your struggle and/or personal experiences learning and working with the concepts covered in this lesson.

* @TODO heads up?

* Ensure that you are using the correct versions of jQuery and Bootstrap.

* @TODO pain points?

* @TODO resources?

* @TODO reference to async

### 2. Instructor Do: [Challenge Intro] (5 min)

* Open `/02-Challenge/Master/index.html` in your brower and explain the following:

    * This weeks challenge is a "Work Day Scheduler". It allows us to enter tasks in hour-long increments over a 9AM to 5PM day. It also presents the user with the date and highlights the hour based on the users location.

    * If we enter a task in one of the hour rows, we can edit it later.

    * If we click the corresponding "save" button, the task will be stored in `localStorage`. 

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

    * ☝️ What recently acquired skills will help us build this challenge?

    * 🙋 We can use Bootstrap for the layout and style; jQuery for the functionality; and Moment.js for the time stamp and highlights.

    * ☝️ How are these skills relevant to a career in web development?

    * 🙋 Libraries and frameworks are widely used in both legacy and greenfield projects to leverage the work of others to quickly build, deploy and maintain our applications. 

    * ☝️ How will this challenge improve your portfolio?

    * 🙋 This challenge will demonstrate knowledge of Bootstrap, jQuery, and Moment.js, three commonly used third-party APIs.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 3. Instructor Do: Demo Bootstrap Card Layout (5 min)

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 @TODO We used this to accomplish { x, y, z }, in { corresponding asynchronous lesson plan }.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 It provides practice in reading documentation, designing a layout, and quickly building user interfaces with Bootstrap. 

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We could start by making a sketch of the grid layout, then consult the Bootstrap documentation for components. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 4. Student Do: Bootstrap Card Layout Activity (10 or 15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `/01-Bootstrap-Card-Layout`.

    In this activity, you will use the Bootstrap grid layout and components to quickly build a user interface.


    ## Instructions

    * Using Bootstrap, build a page from scratch according to the design in the image below.
