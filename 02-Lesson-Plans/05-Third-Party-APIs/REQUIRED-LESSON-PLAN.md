# Module 05 Lesson Plan: Third-party APIs

## Overview 

Two to four sentences describing what‚Äôs in this lesson and its relevance both to the preceding asynchronous content and to the upcoming challenge. Outline the 3-4  key topics that will be drawn from the asynchronous content and reinforced in this lesson for use in the upcoming challenge so that instructors understand how the pieces fit together. 


## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

@TODO
* Explain the difference between jQuery and JavaScript
* Explain the difference between CSS and Bootstrap
* Explain and implement libraries with content delivery networks and static files 
* Perform DOM traversals and manipulations with jQuery
* Explain how to resolve issues related to dynamically generated HTML using jQuery
* Explain and implement the Bootstrap grid layout in HTML
* Integrate Bootstrap components in HTML files to quickly build user interfaces


## Preparing For Class/Instructor Notes 
This section sets the lesson expectations for the instructor. 

* Include tips on how to have a successful class, including letting the instructors know if there is anything they need to complete ahead of class.
* Consider linking to the relevant async lessons to make it easier for instructors to review what students should/may have done before class.
* Explain the areas where students might struggle (or find easy). Make sure your instructors and your TAs understand how to assist students who require it. 
* Include instructor resources if you have any.

@TODO
* Ensure that you are using the correct versions of jQuery and Bootstrap.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the prompts and talking points for review. 


## Pre-Class Activity/Warm-Up 

If there is an activity that students might be starting before class or as they come into the Zoom, insert that here.

### 1. Icebreaker Activity: [Catchy Title] (10 min)
Students will have spent many hours alone this week, working through asynchronous Canvas lesson plans. Some will have been moving confidently and feeling great; others will have been struggling or feeling overwhelmed. This is a moment for students to connect with others, receive empathy and emotional support for their experiences, and get geared up for a positive class, no matter what their week was like and no matter how much of their content they have completed.

Instructors may be expected to customize these activities slightly to meet their own style and personality, but icebreakers may include:

* A-Ha Moments: Go around the room asking students: when did something click? What moves and work helped you move past a position of confusion?
* Childhood Dream: The instructor poses a question asking students to share their childhood dream and then relate it to what their current career aspirations are.

* Share your Struggle: Instructor explains his or her own experience learning these topics and how much work and resilience it took to succeed
* Speed Demons: Messaging that remind students how fast they are moving compared to traditional learners and reminding them that it‚Äôs ok to feel overwhelmed as long as they don‚Äôt give up.
* Super power: ask students to share their ‚Äúsuper powers‚Äù or something they are really good at (coding or outside of class!) 




### 2. Instructor Do: [Challenge Intro] (5 min)
Create talking points for the instructor so that they can quickly introduce the upcoming challenge. The ideal introduction:

* Gets learners excited and confident about the challenge
* Helps learners understand how the async work will support their challenge work 
    * Provides a good mix of ‚Äòtough love‚Äô and ‚Äòforgiveness‚Äô with regards to students‚Äô current progress on the asynchronous content
* Helps learners understand how this class will support their challenge work
* Illustrates briefly how the skills used in the challenge are relevant in industry (e.g., ‚ÄúThe libraries you‚Äôll be accessing in this challenge are the industry standard and are listed in many job requirements.‚Äù)
* States how the artifact students are creating in the challenge will improve their repository/portfolio

* Open `/folder/file` in your brower and explain the following:

    * 

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è @TODO Do we use the `point up` emoji to signify a 'question'?

    * üôã @TODO Yes. And we use the `raising hand` emoji to signfiy an 'answer'




_A 120 minute lesson plan (minus ~25 minutes for intro and outro) would have 95 minutes of instruction. Create 3-5 of the following 3-part arcs to convey the relevant concepts and to address all learning objectives._ 

_A standard arc would be 5-10 minutes of Instructor Do, 10-15 minutes of Student Do, and 5 minutes of review, so each arc could be 20-30 minutes. Of course, complex concepts may demand longer time periods to convey, but try to limit ‚Äúlecture time‚Äù (Instructor Do)  to 10 minutes._

### 3. Instructor Do: Demo Bootstrap Card Layout (5 min) 

The online Instructor Do‚Äôs should ask instructors to teach key concepts from this week‚Äôs content, assuming that students will only have completed 10-40% of offline work. Because of the shortened lesson plan format, individual  should be less than 10 minutes. should rarely surpass 10 minutes each. Remember to connect each Instructor Do to the async content as well as to the upcoming challenge. 

Every Instructor Do should include the following four critical aspects in addition to the actual content that will be delivered:
* Goal or objective for this Instructor Do. 
* Description of how this Instructor Do equips the students for the challenge and, ideally, for the real world outside of the class. 
* Ensure that the Instructor Do explicitly clarifies exactly which topic of the asynchronous content is being highlighted, where it can be found in the asynchronous work, what the core takeaway should be for learners, and how it relates to the upcoming challenge.
    * E.g., ‚ÄúWe are going to drill down today on how to research and install relevant Python libraries and methods. This was covered in the lesson about X this week, when you installed the Y library to help complete Z part of your online work. If you need to review this concept after or during class, open up the lesson that covered X. In your upcoming challenge, you will need to research and install Python libraries in order to complete Z section of your project. This activity will ensure that we‚Äôre all really comfortable with this skill when we get to it.‚Äù
* Finally, be sure to include a clear transition to the student activity. The many instructors delivering your content will have very different levels of teaching and speaking experience, and providing clear methods to transition from Instructor Dos to Student Dos ensure that the flow of activities makes sense to the students, who will want to know exactly when to start moving from passive listening to active working.

**Visuals**: Insert code blocks & screenshots as needed throughout lesson plans. 

**Tip**: Use ‚ÄúTip:‚Äù to callout special advice for the Instructor or TA.

@TODO
* Use the prompts and talking points below to demonstrate the following key point(s):

    * ‚úîÔ∏è Bootstrap components

    * ‚úîÔ∏è Responsive grid layout

* Open `/01-CardLayout/Solved/index.html` in your brower and explain the following:

    * This simple site uses the Bootstrap grid layout and components. 

    @TODO insert image

    * If we resize the browser, or `Toggle device toolbar` in Devtools, we see that the grid layout responds accordingly.

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?

    * üôã We could start by making a sketch of the grid layout, then consult the Bootstrap documentation for components. 

* Use student answers to transition to the next activity.


### 4. Student Do: Bootstrap Card Layout Activity (10 or 15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `/folder/file`.

```md
    # Bootstrap Card Layout

    In this activity, you will use the Bootstrap grid layout and components to quickly build a user interface.


    ## Instructions

    * Using Bootstrap, build a page from scratch according to the design in the image below.

    ![Card-layout design](card-layout.png)


    ## Hint(s)

    * Refer to the [Bootstrap 4 documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/)
```

### 5. Instructor Review: [Activity Name] (5 or 10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

@TODO 
* Use the prompts and talking points below to demonstrate the following key point(s):

    * ‚úîÔ∏è Implementing a row / column layout wiht Bootstrap

    * ‚úîÔ∏è Consulting the Bootstrap documentation for components

* 

### 6. Recap (5 min)
At the end of the class, take five minutes to review the following:
* What should students absolutely know at the end of this module
* What material is okay if they don‚Äôt completely understand?
* Why it‚Äôs important to do as much of the async material as possible (hold students accountable for offline work)
* Once again, where in the asynchronous content should students look to learn more or revisit concepts from this Live Class that they don‚Äôt fully understand


### 7. Promote Additional Resources (5 min)
Use this time to tell instructors to remind students about additional resources that are available to them- Reference pages, Career Services content, Reflection + Retrieval, and other exciting extensions and opportunities to use this content in a novel way.

### 8. Transition to Challenge Study Hall/Office Hours (1 min)
In our current model, students will be invited to an ‚Äòoffice hours‚Äô session of 30 minutes directly after class, in which TAs and instructors will be live online and available for support. We recommend that instructors ask students to stay on the Zoom and ‚Äòstart the challenge‚Äô during this time for 30-60 minutes, while they have live support.
