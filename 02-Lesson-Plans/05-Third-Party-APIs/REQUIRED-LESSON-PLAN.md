# Module 05 Lesson Plan: Third-party APIs

## Overview 

Two to four sentences describing what’s in this lesson and its relevance both to the preceding asynchronous content and to the upcoming challenge. Outline the 3-4  key topics that will be drawn from the asynchronous content and reinforced in this lesson for use in the upcoming challenge so that instructors understand how the pieces fit together. 


## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

@TODO
* Explain the difference between jQuery and JavaScript
* Explain the difference between CSS and Bootstrap
* Explain and implement libraries with content delivery networks and static files 
* Perform DOM traversals and manipulations with jQuery
* Explain how to resolve issues related to dynamically generated HTML using jQuery
* Explain and implement the Bootstrap grid layout in HTML
* Integrate Bootstrap components in HTML files to quickly build user interfaces


## Preparing For Class/Instructor Notes 

* @TODO heads up? 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the prompts and talking points for review. 

* Ensure that you are using the correct versions of jQuery and Bootstrap.

* @TODO pain points?

* @TODO resources?

* @TODO link to async


## Pre-Class Activity/Warm-Up

### 1. Icebreaker Activity: [Catchy Title] (10 min)

* A-Ha Moments: Go around the room asking students: when did something click? What moves and work helped you move past a position of confusion?
* Childhood Dream: The instructor poses a question asking students to share their childhood dream and then relate it to what their current career aspirations are.

* Share your Struggle: Instructor explains his or her own experience learning these topics and how much work and resilience it took to succeed
* Speed Demons: Messaging that remind students how fast they are moving compared to traditional learners and reminding them that it’s ok to feel overwhelmed as long as they don’t give up.
* Super power: ask students to share their “super powers” or something they are really good at (coding or outside of class!) 


### 2. Instructor Do: [Challenge Intro] (5 min)

Create talking points for the instructor so that they can quickly introduce the upcoming challenge. The ideal introduction:

* Gets learners excited and confident about the challenge

* Open `/02-Challenge/Master/index.html` in your brower and explain the following:

    * The challenge is a "Work Day Scheduler". It allows us to enter tasks in hour-long increments over a 9AM to 5PM day. It also presents the user with the date and highlights the hour based on the users location.

    * If we enter a task in one of the hour rows, we can edit it later.

    * If we click the corresponding "save" button, the task will be stored in `localStorage`. 

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):
    * ☝️ What recently acquired skills will help us build this challenge?

    * 🙋 We can use Bootstrap for the layout and style; jQuery for the functionality; and Moment.js for the time stamp and highlights.

    * ☝️ How are these skills relevant in web development?

    * 🙋 Libraries and frameworks are widely used in both legacy and greenfield projects to allow us to leverage the work of others to quickly build, deploy and maintain our applications. 

    * ☝️ How will this challenge improve your portfolio?

    * 🙋 This challenge will demonstrate knowledge of Bootstrap, jQuery, and Moment.js.


### 3. Instructor Do: Demo Bootstrap Card Layout (5 min) 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to demonstrate the following key point(s):

    * ✔️ Bootstrap components

    * ✔️ Responsive grid layout

* Open `/01-CardLayout/Solved/index.html` in your brower and explain the following:

    * This simple site uses the Bootstrap grid layout and several common components. 

    @TODO insert image

    * If we resize the browser, or `Toggle device toolbar` in Devtools, we see that the grid layout responds accordingly.

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

    * ☝️ Where have we seen this before?

    * 🙋 @TODO where in the lesson? 

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us of the challenge?

    * 🙋 It provides us practice in quickly building user interfaces with Bootstrap. 

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We could start by making a sketch of the grid layout, then consult the Bootstrap documentation for components. 

* Use student answers to transition to the next activity.


### 4. Student Do: Bootstrap Card Layout Activity (10 or 15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `/01-Bootstrap-Card-Layout`.

```md
    # Bootstrap Card Layout

    In this activity, you will use the Bootstrap grid layout and components to quickly build a user interface.


    ## Instructions

    * Using Bootstrap, build a page from scratch according to the design in the image below.

    ![Card-layout design](card-layout.png)


    ## Hint(s)

    * Refer to the [Bootstrap 4 documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/)
```


### 5. Instructor Review: [Activity Name] (5 or 10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to demonstrate the following key point(s):

    * ✔️ Implementing a row / column layout wiht Bootstrap

    * ✔️ Consulting the Bootstrap documentation for components

* 


### 6. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

    * ☝️ What do you think you absolutely need to know to succeed at the challenge?

    * 🙋 

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's unnecessary to know anything completely to be successful. 

    * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material as possible?

    * 🙋 @TODO 

    - [ ] The Recap provides meaningful information about what students should do if they don’t understand concepts yet

- [ ] The Recap contains a reminder about how important async content is to success


### 7. Promote Additional Resources (5 min)

* Direct students to the additional resources available to them:

    * Reference pages

    * Career Services content

    * Reflection + Retrieval


### 8. Transition to Challenge Study Hall/Office Hours (1 min)

* Announce 'office hours' and invite students to stay on the Zoom and ‘start the challenge’ while they have live support from instructional staff.
