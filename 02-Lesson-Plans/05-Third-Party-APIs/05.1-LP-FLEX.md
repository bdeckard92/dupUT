# Module X Flex Session: [Title]

## Overview 

Flex Sessions are two hour Zoom sessions held earlier in the week (Mondays/Tuesdays) and are optional for students. Students are expected to be in the middle of working on their asynchronous content during this time of the week. 

The primary goals of Flex Sessions are to:

* Build community and help students feel more connected to instructors and one another

* Help students who are “stuck” on the asynchronous work and would appreciate extra guidance and support

* Provide extra context in the learning journey around career preparation and workforce readiness

@TODO In today's flex session, { ... } outline the career topic and the 2-3 key topic areas that will be drawn from the asynchronous content and reinforced in this lesson. 


## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Explain...

* Use...

* Implement...


## Preparing For Class/Instructor Notes

* When reviewing activities, ask for volunteers to share their solutions and/or ask students to walk through the solution, line-by-line.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, share your struggle and/or personal experiences learning and working with the concepts covered in this lesson.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* @TODO heads up?

* @TODO pain points?

* @TODO resources?

* @TODO reference to async

## Class Instruction 

### 1. Introduction/Take Pulse (5 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Direct students to post individual questions in the Zoom chat to be addressed by TAs and/or at the end of class.

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

    * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

    * 🙋 @TODO .

    * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic? 

    * 🙋 Let's do "Fist to Five" together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).


### 2. Activity Arc 1: Career Tie-In/Industry Focus (20-30 min)

This first activity should be designed to allow students to prepare for their entrance into or acceleration within the profession. Ideally, this activity is designed in a way that both adds clear value and is interesting enough to be ‘advertised’ to students in advance. 

The most common activity for this section should be completing one or more algorithmic  practice problems resembling a technical interview question. The purpose of these exercises would be to expose students to the idea of being presented a problem to resolve in a short amount of time, as well as get them comfortable with white-boarding solutions and talking through their thought processes.

Other career tie-in/industry focus activities may include:
* Deconstructing and demystifying a job description

* Reviewing and comparing the most common coding languages and tools

* Helping build the ‘mindset’ of a developer by asking the instructor modeling how professionals approach problems

* Examining the different routes by which new developers get their first job

* Activities about how to showcase a developer Github or portfolio

* Activities deconstructing a strong and relevant README

* Share different open-source projects or side projects students can take up after the course. 


### 3. Instructor Demo: [Activity Name] (5 or 10 min) 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to demonstrate the following key point(s):

    * ✔️ 

    * ✔️ 

* Open `/folder/file` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

    * @TODO When we do this, it does that.

    * @TODO We also see these things.

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 @TODO We used this to accomplish { x, y, z }, in { corresponding asynchronous lesson plan }.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 @TODO . 

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 @TODO . 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 4. Student Do: [Activity Name] (10 or 15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `/folder/file`.

```md
    @TODO add instructions; tabbed
```


### 5. Instructor Review: [Activity Name] (5 or 10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key point(s):

    * ✔️ @TODO

    * ✔️ @TODO

* Open `/folder/file` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * @TODO 

    ```@TODO code

    ```

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

    * ☝️ @TODO ?

    * 🙋 @TODO .

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understanding this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [](), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 6. Instructor Demo: jQuery Sandwich Click (5 or 10 min) 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to demonstrate the following key point(s):

    * ✔️ Using state variables

    * ✔️ Handling events with jQuery `.on()`

    * ✔️ Setting HTML contents with jQuery `.html()`
    
* Open `/02-JQuery-Sandwich-Click/Solved/index.html` in your browser and explain the following:

    * When we click one of the sandwich buttons, we are presented with two alerts: the first with a witty comment about the sandwich; the second a count of the number of sandiwches eaten. 

    * When we resolve the alerts, an image of the sandwich is rendered in the browser. 

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 @TODO We used this to accomplish { x, y, z }, in { corresponding asynchronous lesson plan }.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We are reviewing how to handle events, work with state variables and dynamically render HTML.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We first need to scaffold our application with HTML, including three buttons and an element to hold dynamically generated content. We then need to set up event handlers to listen for clicks and respond to those clicks with alert messages and an image.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 7. Student Do: jQuery Sandwich Click (10 or 15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `/`.

```md
    # jQuery Sandwich Click

    In this activity, you will build an interactive application that tracks state and handles events.

    ## Instructions

    * From scratch, create a simple jQuery application with the following functionality:

        * Renders three buttons, each referencing a different type of sandwich. 

        * When a button is clicked, a first alert displays a witty statement about the specific sandwich.
        
        * When the first alert is resolved, a second alert message displays the number of that specific sandwich the user has eaten.

    ## Hint(s)

    You will need to use global variables to track state.

    ## BONUS

    Render an image for each click event.
```


### 8. Instructor Review: jQuery Sandwich Click (5 or 10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key point(s):

    * ✔️ Using state variables

    * ✔️ Handling events with jQuery `.on()`

    * ✔️ Setting HTML contents with jQuery `.html()`

* Open `/02-JQuery-Sandwich-Click/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

    * We create three `<button>` elements, each with an `id` and corresponding content for our sandwiches.

    ```html
    <button id="pbj">Peanut Butter Jelly</button>
	<button id="grilledcheese">Grilled Cheese</button>
    <button id="roastbeef">Roast Beef</button>
    ```

    * We declare an empty `<div>` with an id of `#image-div`.

    ```html
    	<div id="image-div"></div>
    ```

    * ☝️ What is the purpose of this empty `<div>`?

    * 🙋 We will render images in it.

    * 🔑 In our `<script>` tag we declare three global state variables to count the number of sandwiches eaten.

    ```js
    var pbjCounter = 0;
    var grilledCheeseCounter = 0;
    var roastBeefCounter = 0;
    ```

    * 🔑 We declare three `.on()` methods, each listening for `click` events on a sandwich button, using the corresponding `id`.

    ```js
    $("#pbj").on("click", function() {
      
      alert("Mmm... Peanut Butter Jelly Time.");
      pbjCounter++;
      alert("You've eaten " + pbjCounter + " PB&J sandwiches");
      
      // BONUS
      $("#image-div").html("<img src='https://i1.wp.com/snotapwi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/PBJ-Sandwiches.jpg?resize=590%2C368&ssl=1' />");
      
    });
    ```

    * 📝 Within our `on()` methods, we use the increment operator to increase the sandwich count.

    * 🔑 The image is rendered using the `html()` method on the `<div>` with the id of `#image-div`. We set the `src` of the image to an external, third-party URL.

    * Lastly, we add jQuery to our document using another `<script>` tag below the first. 

    ```html
      <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
    ```

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

    * ☝️ Why do we add our JavaScript (and jQuery files) at the bottom of the `<body>` element?

    * 🙋 To prevent our script from running before the DOM renders.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understanding this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [jQuery `on()`](https://api.jquery.com/on/) and [jQuery `html()`](https://api.jquery.com/html/) documentation, and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 09. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

    * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

    * 🙋 @TODO 

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's unnecessary to know anything completely to be successful. 

    * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material as possible?

    * 🙋 It's important to do as much of the lesson material prior to class to not only be fully prepared to start the challenge, but your career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in our bootcamp. Lessons are designed to give each topic a unique and optimal amount of depth so we can provide the scope needed to confidently build upon, while ensuring time for other important material.

    * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

    * 🙋 @TODO YES, WHERE?

    * ☝️ What is exciting about the remaining lessons?

    * 🙋 @TODO YES, WHAT?


### 10. Study Hall (30 min)

* Announce 'study hall' and invite students to stay on the Zoom and ‘start the challenge’ while they have live support from instructional staff.
