# Module 05 Virtual Class: Third-party APIs

## Overview 

In today's virtual class, students will review Bootstrap and jQuery basics. Students will use the Bootstrap grid layout and components to quickly scaffold a UI, as well as perform time and date conversions using Moment.js. Students will also build a "to-do list" application that is very similar to the weekly Challenge. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Explain and implement libraries with content delivery networks and static files 

* Explain and implement the Bootstrap grid layout in HTML

* Integrate Bootstrap components in HTML files to quickly build user interfaces

* Perform date conversions using Moment.js

* Perform DOM traversals and manipulations with jQuery

* Explain how to resolve issues related to dynamically generated HTML using jQuery


## Instructor Notes 

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try and anticipate questions students may have.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* When reviewing activities, ask for volunteers to share their solutions and/or ask students to walk through the solution line-by-line.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, share your struggle and/or personal experiences learning and working with the concepts covered in this lesson.

* Ensure that you are using the correct versions of jQuery and Bootstrap (v4).

* Students will find `this` challenging. Review the `05-jQuery-Todo-localStorage` activity prior to class and be prepared to discuss `this`.

* In the async material, Bootstrap is first introduced in Lesson 2 where students are tasked with adding Bootstrap classes to match a mock up of the Taskmaster Pro webpage. jQuery is introduced in Lesson 3 where students are tasked with adding drag and drop functionality to the Taskmaster Pro webpage. Moment.js is first introduced in Lesson 4 for where students are tasked with adding due date audits to the Taskmaster Pro webpage.

## Office Hours

Encourage students to work on the remaining module algorithms during office hours. Review the algorithm solutions 5–10 minutes before class begins or during office hours after class.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What did we learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

    * 🙋 We learned how to use third-party APIs, such as Bootstrap, jQuery and Moment.js. We are moving fast compared to traditional learners. It’s ok to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ Did anyone have an 'ah-ha' moment this week? When and why did it click? 

    * 🙋 Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we are thinking about the problem.

    * ☝️ Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

    * 🙋 It's easy to get stuck when you're learning web development. It's important to learn how get unstuck because it happens to the pros, too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups are a great because explaining your problems to someone else often reveals their solution. 


### 2. Review Current Challenge (5 min)

* Open `02-Challenge/Main/index.html` in your browser and explain the following:

    * This week's challenge is a "Work Day Scheduler". It allows us to enter tasks in hour-long increments over a 9AM to 5PM day. It also presents the user with the date and highlights the hour based on the users location.

    * If we enter a task in one of the hour rows, we can edit it later.

    * If we click the corresponding "save" button, the task will be stored in `localStorage`. 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What recently acquired skills will help us build this challenge?

    * 🙋 We can use Bootstrap for the layout and style; jQuery for the functionality; and Moment.js for the time stamp and highlights.

    * ☝️ How are these skills relevant to a career in web development?

    * 🙋 Libraries and frameworks are widely used in both legacy and greenfield projects to leverage the work of others to quickly build, deploy and maintain our applications. 

    * ☝️ How will this challenge improve your portfolio?

    * 🙋 This challenge will demonstrate knowledge of Bootstrap, jQuery, and Moment.js, three commonly used third-party APIs.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 3. Instructor Demo: Bootstrap Card Layout (5 min) 

* Open `03-Bootstrap-Card-Layout/Solved/index.html` in your browser and explain the following:

    * 🔑 This simple site uses the Bootstrap grid layout and several common components. 

    * 🔑 If we resize the browser, or `Toggle device toolbar` in Devtools, we see that the grid layout responds accordingly.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used this to create four responsive columns for tasks that were either "To do", "In progress", "In Review", or "Done", in Lesson 2.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 It provides practice in reading documentation, designing a layout, and quickly building user interfaces with Bootstrap. 

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We could start by making a sketch of the grid layout, then consult the Bootstrap documentation for components. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 4. Student Do: Bootstrap Card Layout (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `03-Bootstrap-Card-Layout/README.md`.

```md
# Bootstrap Card Layout

In this activity, you will use the Bootstrap grid layout with Navbar and Card components.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/index.html](Unsolved/index.html).

* Using Bootstrap, build a page matching the design in the following image:

  ![Card-layout design](card-layout.png) 

  * In the `<head>`, import Bootstrap using the CDN.

  * In the `<body>`, add a responsive Navbar that automatically collapses at the `lg` breakpoint.
 
  * In the `<div>` with the `"container"` class, start creating your rows and columns of the grid layout.

    * Create one row and within that create a column. Add a heading "About Me".

    * Add a row and within that create a column. Add an image using [http://placehold.it](http://placehold.it) to generate a placeholder image of 150x150 pixels.

    * Within that same row, add one more column. Add a paragraph using `Lorem ipsum` for dummy text.

    * Create a new column with a Card component.

* Play around with the width of the columns to make it all fit and match the given design to the best of your ability. 

## Hint(s)

* Refer to the Bootstrap [Navbar documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/navbar), [Grid system documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/), [Card documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/card/).

## Bonus

* Add `About`, `Portfolio`, and `Contact` Navbar items
```

### 5. Instructor Review: Bootstrap Card Layout (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ Import Bootstrap

    * ✔️ Responsive Navbar component

    * ✔️ Row / Column Grid Layout

    * ✔️ Card component

* Open `03-Bootstrap-Card-Layout/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

    * 🔑 We import Bootstrap using the CDN in the `<head>` of our `index.html` file. 

    ```html
    <!-- Bootstrap CDN -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css">
    ```

    * 🔑 We then add a responsive Navbar component in the `<body>` of our document. 

    ```html
    <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-dark bg-dark">
        <span class="navbar-brand mb-1 h1">Navbar</span>
        <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#navbarSupportedContent"
        aria-controls="navbarSupportedContent" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
        <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
        </button>
    ```

    * For Bootstrap components like this we can copy/paste it from the [Navbar documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/navbar).

    * If you attempted the bonus, this is how you can add additional navbar items:

    ```html
    <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarSupportedContent">
    <ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right">
        <li class="nav-item">
        <a class="nav-link" href="#">About</a>
        </li>
        <li class="nav-item">
        <a class="nav-link" href="#">Portfolio</a>
        </li>
        <li class="nav-item">
        <a class="nav-link" href="#">Contact</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    ```

    * The `<div class="container">` is below the Navbar element and not at the top of our `<body>` because we want our Navbar to span the width of the page. The container class will "contain" our content to a fixed width.

    * 🔑 Within our container div, we create our first row, and within that a column with a width of 8.

    ```html
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-8">
    ```

    * Within our first column, we add a heading "About Me" and another row.

    ```html
    <h1>About Me</h1>
        <div class="row">
    ```

     * ☝️ Why did we place this new row below our `<h1>`?

    * 🙋 We want our header to span the width of our container.

    * 🔑 Within this new row, we add two columns with widths of 3 and 9, respectively. 

    * In the first column, we add an image from <http://placehold.it/150x150>:

    ```html
    <div class="col-md-3">
        <img src="http://placehold.it/150x150" alt="Placeholder" class="img-thumbnail">
    </div>
    ```

    * In the second column, we add a paragraph of text:

    ```html
    <div class="col-md-9">
        <p>
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Quisque dignissim, felis ut dictum tristique,
            nibh erat feugiat libero, sit amet fringilla mauris velit in mi. Duis tempus felis vitae
            felis vulputate pretium. Nullam commodo, est ac auctor ornare, eros nisi fringilla sem,
            non pulvinar tortor lorem sit amet sem. Aenean quis erat facilisis, porttitor ex cursus,
            luctus enim. Curabitur et metus in lacus tristique sagittis et in lorem. Nunc id nisi et
            neque fringilla ultricies. Aenean at feugiat elit, a posuere justo. Pellentesque egestas
            dolor et nisi venenatis, nec fermentum urna fringilla. Etiam efficitur porta purus, id
            posuere sem congue a.
        </p>
    </div>
    ```

     * ☝️ Why did we choose widths of 3 and 9?

    * 🙋 The Bootstrap grid layout is based on 12 units. 

    * To finish our layout, we add a new column with a width of 4.

    ```html
    <div class="col-md-4">
    ```

    * ☝️ Why did we choose a width of 4?

    * 🙋 We assigned our first column a width of 8.

    * 🔑 Within our new column, we add a Card component, again taken from the [Card documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/card/).

    ```html
    <div class="card mt-2">
        <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title">Card title</h5>
            <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Card subtitle</h6>
            <p class="card-text">Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ When is it okay to copy / paste code?

    * 🙋 When it is publicly available in the official documentation for a library or framework and/or the license allows you to do so.

    * ☝️ When is it not okay to copy / paste code?

    * 🙋 When it is under copyright or a restrictive license. It's also not okay to copy / paste code from someone else's project and submit it as your own for grading!

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understanding this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 2, read the [Introduction to Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) documentation, and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 6. Instructor Demo: Moment.js (5 min) 

* Open `04-MomentJS/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 If we inspect this application with DevTools, we see in date conversion logged in the console. 

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used this to audit due dates of tasks in Lesson 4.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We will need to perform date and time calculations.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We would first import Moment.js, then we would consult the Moment.js documentation to learn how to perform date conversions.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 7. Student Do: Moment.js (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-MomentJS/README.md`.

```md
# MomentJS

In this activity, you will perform date conversions using Moment.js.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/index.html](Unsolved/index.html) and do the following:

  * Import Moment.js

  * Convert the `randomDate` to the "MM/DD/YYYY" format using `moment()` and set it to a variable called `convertedDate`. Log it into the console. 

  * Convert `convertedDate` into three other date formats of your choice using `.format()` and log them into the console.

  * Calculate the time in years, months, days between today and the `convertedDate` using `.toNow()` and `.diff()` and log them into the console. 

  * Calculate the number of days between the `convertedDate` and 02/14/2001 and log it into the console. 

  * Determine what day of the week and what week of the year the `convertedDate` falls on and log them into the console. 

## Hint(s)

* You may need to consult the [Moment.js docs](https://momentjs.com/docs/) and the [Moment.js Format documentation](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/)
```

### 8. Instructor Review: Moment.js (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ Import Moment.js via CDN

    * ✔️ Performing date conversions using Moment.js

* Open `/04-MomentJS/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 We first import Moment.js: 

    ```html
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/momentjs/2.12.0/moment.min.js"></script>
    ```

    * 🔑 Then we need to convert our `randomDate` to the "MM/DD/YYYY" format using `moment()`:

    ```js
    var randomDate = "02/23/1999";
    var randomFormat = "MM/DD/YYYY";
    var convertedDate = moment(randomDate, randomFormat);
    ```

    * This returns an object, which we can inspect in DevTools if we `console.log(convertedDate)`.

    * 🔑 We convert `convertedDate` into three other date formats using the `.format()` method. Students may have chosen to convert the date into other date formats than what we used. Ask some students to share their answers.

    ```js
    console.log(convertedDate.format("MM/DD/YY"));
    console.log(convertedDate.format("MMM Do, YYYY hh:mm:ss"));
    console.log(convertedDate.format("X"));
    ```

    * 📝 The `X` is Unix time.

    * 🔑 Next we calculate the time in years, months, days between today and `convertedDate` using the `.toNow()` and `.diff()` methods:
    
    ```js
    console.log(convertedDate.toNow());
    console.log(convertedDate.diff(moment(), "years"));
    console.log(convertedDate.diff(moment(), "months"));
    console.log(convertedDate.diff(moment(), "days"));
    ```

    * 🔑 We calculate the number of days between `convertedDate` and "02/14/2001" by creating a new `moment` object and using the `.diff()` method:

    ```js
    var newDate = moment("02/14/2001", randomFormat);
    console.log(convertedDate.diff(newDate, "days"));
    ```

    * 🔑 Lastly, we determine the day and week of the `convertedDate` by passing the `"DDD"` and `"dddd"` arguments to the `.format()` method.

    ```js
    console.log(convertedDate.format("DDD"));
    console.log(convertedDate.format("dddd"));
    ```    

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understanding this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 4, read the [Moment.js docs](https://momentjs.com/docs/), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 9. Instructor Demo: jQuery To-do List with localStorage (5 min) 

* Open `05-jQuery-ToDo-localStorage/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 We add items to our to-do list through a form field. Clicking the `Add item` button adds them both to the list rendered in the DOM and to `localStorage`.

    * 🔑 If we inspect Local Storage in the Application tab in DevTools, we will see the items we added.

    * 🔑 We can delete items from the list using the button prepended to each list item.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used this to convert Todo lists into Sortables in Lesson 3.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 Getting form values with jQuery, and getting and setting items in `localStorage` will help us succeed in the challenge. 

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We would start by get the value in the form field, store the value in `localStorage`, get items from `localStorage` and render those items to the DOM.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 10. Student Do: jQuery To-do List with localStorage (20 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `05-jQuery-ToDo-localStorage/README.md`.

```md
# jQuery To-do List with localStorage

In this activity, you will dynamically generate HTML and get form values using jQuery, as well as set and get items in localStorage.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/index.html](Unsolved/index.html) and do the following:

  * Take time to examine the code and comments, especially for the `renderTodos()` function.

  * Modify the event handler for the `#add-to-do` form
  
    * When it is 'clicked', the value in the form field is assigned to a variable, which is then pushed to the `list` array and passed into the `renderTodos()` function.

    * Save the to-dos to `localStorage` using `JSON.stringify()`

  * Modify the event handler for the `.checkbox`
  
    * When it is 'clicked', get the `id` of the button in order to delete the right to-do from the `list` array and pass into the `renderTodos()` function.

    * Save the to-dos to `localStorage` using `JSON.stringify()`

## Hint(s)

* Detailed instructions are in the `index.html` file as comments.

* You may need to refer to the [`this` MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this),[data-attributes MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/data-*), and [jQuery `.on()` documentation](https://api.jquery.com/on/).
```

### 11. Instructor Review: jQuery To-do List with localStorage (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ Dynamically generating HTML with jQuery
    
    * ✔️ Getting form values with jQuery

    * ✔️ `setItem()` and `getItem()` in localStorage

* Open `05-jQuery-ToDo-localStorage/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

    * Let's examine the code first. We see an `Input Form` at the top of the page:

    ```html
    <form>
      <span id="todo-item"
        >To Do Item: <input id="to-do" type="text"/><input
          id="add-to-do"
          value="Add Item"
          type="submit"
      /></span>
    </form>
    ```

    * Beneath that is the `To-Do List` which will list out the to-dos:

    ```html
    <div id="to-dos"></div>
    ```

    * 🔑 Inside the `script` tag, we declare a `list` variable and set the value of `list` to the parsed contents retrieved from `localStorage` using the `.getItem()` method. But, if there is nothing in `localStorage`, we use the OR operator to set the value of `list` to an empty array.

    ```js
    var list = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("todolist")) || [];
    ```

    * 🔑 We are given a `renderTodos()` function. The function accepts a `list` argument, iterates over that list, and for each item in the list, creates a `<p>` element prepended with a `<button>` element.

    ```js
    function renderTodos(list) {
        // Empties out the html
        $('#to-dos').empty();

        // Iterates over the 'list'
        for (var i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
          // Creates a new variable 'toDoItem' that will hold a "<p>" tag
          // Sets the `list` item's value as text of this <p> element
          var toDoItem = $('<p>');
          toDoItem.text(list[i]);

          // Creates a button `toDoClose` with an attribute called `data-to-do` and a unique `id`
          var toDoClose = $('<button>');
          toDoClose.attr('data-to-do', i);

          // Gives the button a class called 'checkbox'
          toDoClose.addClass('checkbox');

          // Adds a checkmark symbol as its text value
          toDoClose.text('✓');

          // Adds the button to the `toDoItem`
          toDoItem = toDoItem.prepend(toDoClose);

          // Adds 'toDoItem' to the To-Do List div
          $('#to-dos').append(toDoItem);
        }
    }
    ```

    * 🔑 There is an event handler to the `#add-to-do` form using `.on()`. When our application hears a 'click' on the form `<input>`, the value in the form field is assigned to a variable, `toDoTask`. It is then pushed to the `list` array and passed to our `renderTodos` function. 

    ```js
      $('#add-to-do').on('click', function(event) {
        event.preventDefault();

        // Get the to-do "value" from the textbox and store it as a variable using `.val()` and `.trim()`
        var toDoTask = $('#to-do')
          .val()
          .trim();

        // Add the new to-do to our local 'list' variable
        list.push(toDoTask);

        // Update the to-dos on the page
        renderTodos(list);
    ```

    * 🔑 We update `localStorage` with the new `list` array using the `setItem()` method and `JSON.stringify()`:
    
    ```js
    // Save the to-dos into localStorage
    // We need to use JSON.stringify to turn the list from an array into a string
    localStorage.setItem('todolist', JSON.stringify(list));

    // Clear the textbox when done using `.val()`
    $('#to-do').val('');
    ```

    * 🔑 Because our checkbox buttons were dynamically generated, we apply our `on()` event handler to the `document` to listen for a `"click"` on any element with a class of `.checkbox`:

    ```js
    $(document).on("click", ".checkbox", function() {
    ```

    * Using `this`, we assign the value stored in the `"data-to-do"` attribute in a `toDoNumber` variable. We then splice `toDoNumber` out of the `list` and call `renderTodos()` with our updated `list`. 
    
    * 🔑 We update the `localStorage` with the current list:

    ```js
    // Get the `id` of the button from its data attribute and hold in a variable called 'toDoNumber'
    var toDoNumber = $(this).attr('data-to-do');

    // Delete the to-do with that `id` from our local `list` using `.splice()`
    list.splice(toDoNumber, 1);

    // Update the to-dos on the page
    renderTodos(list);

    // Save the to-dos into localStorage
    // We need to use JSON.stringify to turn the list from an array into a string
    localStorage.setItem('todolist', JSON.stringify(list));
    ```

    * Lastly, we call our `renderTodos()` function and pass it our `list` to set everything in motion.

    ```js
    // render our to-dos on page load
    renderTodos(list);
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Why do we add the event handler to the document?

    * 🙋 The buttons did not exist before the DOM was rendered so we can't specify what element to listen to in advance.

    * ☝️ What is the purpose of `$("#to-dos").empty();`?

    * 🙋 It clears the `#to-dos` `<div>`. If we didn't call the `empty()` method, our list would be appended to the `#to-dos` `<div>` every time we opened or refreshed our page resulting in a redundant, messy interface.
    
    * ☝️ What is `this`?

    * 🙋 `this` refers to the function invoked by the `click` event.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understanding this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 3, read [`this` MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this),[data-attributes MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/data-*), and [jQuery `.on()` documentation](https://api.jquery.com/on/) and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 12. Recap & Promote Additional Resources (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What do you think you absolutely need to know to succeed at the challenge?

    * 🙋 To succeed at the challenge, we need to know how to build user interfaces using Bootstrap components with grid layout. We also need to know how to do the following with jQuery: how to get values from forms, and how to get and set items in `localStorage`. Lastly, using Moment.js, we need to know how to get the current date, the users timezone, and create a highlighted time bar.

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it is not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful. 

    * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material prior to class as possible?

    * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

* Direct students to the additional resources available to them:

    * Reflection and Retrieval

    * Career Connection

    * Dessert Menu

### 13. Introduce Upcoming Challenge (5 min)

* Open `01-Class-Content/06-Server-Side-APIs/02-Challenge/Main/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

    * In the next challenge, we will be building a weather dashboard that will run in the browser.

    * When we enter a city in the search box, we receive the current forecast, temperature, and humidity.

    * We also receive a 5-day forecast nicely displayed in their own boxes with all the relevant information.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What are we learning?

    * 🙋 We are learning to use `fetch` to make complex API calls and JavaScript to dynamically display responses to the browser.

    * ☝️ How does this project build off or extend previously learned material?

    * 🙋 We will need a firm understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build this project.

    * ☝️ How does this project relate to your career goals?

    * 🙋 Creating nice UIs and displaying responses from API requests are a big part of web development and an important skill that you are fostering.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.
