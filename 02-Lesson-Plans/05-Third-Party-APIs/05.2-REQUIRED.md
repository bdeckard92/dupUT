# 05.2 Virtual Class: Third-Party APIs

## Overview

In today's virtual class, you will review Bootstrap and jQuery basics. Students will use the Bootstrap grid layout and components to quickly scaffold a UI for a webpage. Students will also learn about how jQuery UI widgets and interactions can make a webpage more user-friendly.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Explain the concept of CSS frameworks.

* Optimize page layouts using Bootstrap's responsive grid system and utility classes.

* Describe jQuery UI widgets and interactions to implement sortable lists, datepickers, and autocomplete.

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before class begins. Try to anticipate questions students may have.

* Take a few minutes before class to get familiar with both the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [jQuery UI](https://jqueryui.com/) documentation, as students will rely heavily on these resources in class and might need help finding answers.

* It's important that students understand that Bootstrap is basically just a large stylesheet, and that they already have a lot of the skills needed to use it. If students struggle with certain concepts, try to jog their memory of learning CSS and suggest that they use Chrome DevTools to decipher the styles being used.

* Reiterate often that, like CSS, using Bootstrap classes requires a bit of trial and error to achieve the intended design and layout. Encourage students to experiment with different combinations of classes to become more comfortable with the process and to learn more about their personal preferences.

* Emphasize that whenever we use a new library, framework, or technology, it's best to familiarize ourselves with the official documentation as much as possible.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly, ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity, and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* When reviewing activities, ask for volunteers to share their solutions and/or ask students to walk through the solution line by line.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Make sure you're using the correct versions of jQuery and Bootstrap (v4).

* In the async material, Bootstrap is first introduced in Lesson 2, where students add Bootstrap classes to match a mock-up of the Taskmaster Pro webpage. jQuery is introduced in Lesson 3, where students add drag-and-drop functionality to the Taskmaster Pro webpage.

* Encourage students to work on the remaining module algorithms during Office Hours. Review the algorithm solutions 5–10 minutes before class begins.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

	* ☝️ What did we learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

	* 🙋 We learned how to use third-party APIs, such as Bootstrap, jQuery, and Moment.js. We are moving quickly compared to traditional learners. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed -- as long as we don’t give up!

	* ☝️ Did anyone have any "a-ha" moments this week? When and why did something click?

	* 🙋 Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we are thinking about it.

	* ☝️ Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

	* 🙋 It's easy to get stuck when you're learning web development. It's important to learn how get unstuck because it happens to the pros, too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups are a great because explaining your problems to someone else often reveals their solution.

### 2. Review Current Challenge (5 min)

* Open `02-Challenge/Main/index.html` in your browser and explain the following:

	* This week's Challenge is a Work Day Scheduler. It allows a user to enter tasks in hour-long increments over a 9-to-5 day. It also presents the user with the date, and highlights the hour based on the user's location.

	* If we enter a task into one of the hour rows, we can edit it later.

	* If we click the corresponding "Save" button, the task will be stored in `localStorage`.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

	* ☝️ What recently acquired skills will help us build this Challenge?

	* 🙋 We can use Bootstrap for the layout and style, jQuery for the functionality, and Moment.js for the time stamp and highlights.

	* ☝️ How are these skills relevant to a career in web development?

	* 🙋 Libraries and frameworks are widely used in both legacy and new projects to leverage the work of others to quickly build, deploy, and maintain our applications.

	* ☝️ How will this Challenge improve your portfolio?

	* 🙋 The Challenge will demonstrate knowledge of Bootstrap, jQuery, and Moment.js -- three commonly used third-party APIs.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 3. Instructor Demo: Bootstrap Layout (5 min)

* Open `03-Bootstrap-Layout/Solved/index.html` in your browser and explain the following:

	* 🔑 This simple site uses the Bootstrap grid layout and several common components.

	* 🔑 If we resize the browser or use the toggle-device toolbar in Chrome DevTools, we see that the grid layout responds accordingly.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

	* ☝️ Where have we used this before?

	* 🙋 In Lesson 2, we used this to create four responsive columns for tasks that were either "To do", "In progress", "In Review", or "Done".

	* ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

	* 🙋 It provides practice in reading documentation, designing a layout, and quickly building user interfaces using Bootstrap.

	* ☝️ How would we build this?

	* 🙋 We could start by making a sketch of the grid layout, then consult the Bootstrap documentation for components.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Bootstrap Layout (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `03-Bootstrap-Layout/README.md`, which are also shown below.

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

  ```md
  # 📖 Implement Responsive Layout

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to be able to create a responsive layout without having to write custom CSS.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It is done when the page displays a multicolumn layout on large screens and matches the mock-up provided.

  * It is done when the screen displays in a single-column layout on smaller screens and matches how it looks currently.

  ## 📝 Notes

  Refer to the following documentation:

  [Bootstrap documentation for the grid](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/layout/grid/)

  ## Assets

  The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

  ![The webpage layout features multiple rows and columns using Bootstrap's grid system.](./Images/01-solved-screenshot.png)

  ---

  ## 💡 Hint

  * Don't forget to use the previous activity as a guide to how Bootstrap classes can be used.

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed the activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What are some ways that Chrome DevTools can demystify the CSS that powers the grid? Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this question.
  ```

### 5. Instructor Review: Bootstrap Layout (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points (✔️):

  * ✔️ `col-*` needs to be direct child of `row`.

  * ✔️ It is mobile-first. Use breakpoints to go up, not down.

  * ✔️ We do not need to take up the full width.

* Open `03-Bootstrap-Layout/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

 * 🔑 Every grid layout we create starts with an HTML element receiving a class of `row`, and turns it into a flexbox layout.

  * 🔑 Walk through the following portion of the solution HTML to explain the column sizing at different breakpoints and the grid alignment with `align-items-end`:

    ```html
		<div class="row align-items-end">
			<div class="col-12 col-md-6">
				<img class='img-fluid' src="https://via.placeholder.com/1920x1080" alt="video placeholder" />
			</div>
			<div class="col-12 col-md-6">
				<h1>Welcome to the app.</h1>
				<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Perspiciatis, reprehenderit! Placeat quo
					necessitatibus porro corporis quasi architecto sit aspernatur inventore, perspiciatis nulla hic soluta ipsum
					ipsa sed iure dolorum! Tenetur? Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Ex voluptatem
					dolorum earum esse recusandae facere aliquam. Excepturi facilis sint nesciunt ipsa, eveniet facere in quidem
					voluptas exercitationem distinctio commodi laborum!</p>
				<button class="btn btn-primary">Learn more.</button>
			</div>
		</div>
    ```

  * 🔑 When we don't want to have a column take up the full width of the page, we can center-justify the row's contents and set the column to be smaller on larger screen sizes.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What do the `-sm`, `-md`, and `-lg` in the class names do for us?

  * 🙋 They instruct the columns to be different sizes on different screen widths using media queries.

  * ☝️ Did anyone find anything interesting in the documentation that we didn't use here?

  * 🙋 We can automatically size columns by using simple `col` classes and reordering them, among many other things!

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 2, read the [Bootstrap documentation on the grid](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/layout/grid/), and attend Office Hours to ask for help. Use the Bootstrap examples in the documentation as a starting point, and then tweak the class names to try out different layouts. Having a good understanding of CSS flexbox properties will ultimately be the best way to learn the grid.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Bootstrap Utilities (5 min)

* Open `04-Bootstrap-Utilities/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

	* 🔑 We see a Sign Up form that is centered horizontally and vertically on the page.

	* 🔑 The background color of the page is dark, and the background color of the form is white.

	* 🔑 The text color of the page header is white.

	* This was implemented using Bootstrap utility classes.

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used Bootstrap utility classes in Lesson 2.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

    * 🙋 We will use Bootstrap utility classes to style our components.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We would need to read the Bootstrap documentation to implement Bootstrap utility classes to our HTML.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Bootstrap Utilities (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Bootstrap-Utilities/README.md`, which are also shown below.

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

  ```md
  # 📖 Adjust Positioning and Styling on the Page

  Work with a partner to implement the following user stories:

  * As a developer, I want to be able to center the form on the page horizontally and vertically without writing any custom CSS.

  * As a developer, I want to be able to adjust and add style to the page without writing any custom CSS.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It is done when the main content on the page is centered horizontally and vertically.

  * It is done when the background color of the page is dark.

  * It is done when the background color of the form is white.

  * It is done when the text color of the page header is white.

  ## 📝 Notes

  Refer to the following documentation:

  * [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/)(look for Utilities in the left navigation menu)

  ## Assets

  The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

  ![A white form is centered on the page with a dark background.](./Images/01-solved-screenshot.png)

  ---

  ## 💡 Hint

  * Don't forget to use the previous examples and activities as a guide to how the utility classes can be used.

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed the activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * Using Chrome DevTools, what can you do to make this look more personalized? Try updating some of the more generic styles to use different colors or font sizes.
  ```

### 8. Instructor Review: Bootstrap Utilities (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points (✔️):

  * ✔️ Centered content

  * ✔️ Background color

  * ✔️ Text color

  * ✔️ Flex properties

* Open `04-Bootstrap-Utilities/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We centered the page's content vertically and horizontally by giving the page a minimum height set to the height of the page and making it a flexbox. We also applied a dark background.

    ```html
    <div class="min-vh-100 d-flex align-items-center bg-dark">
    ```

  * 🔑 Next, we added classes to use sizing properties to make the row run the full width of the page, and we used flex properties to center-justify content.

	```html
	<section class="w-100 row justify-content-center">
	```

  * 🔑 We added classes to center the header and make it white.

	```html
	<h1 class="display-3 text-center text-white">Sign Up!</h1>
	```

  * 🔑 Finally, we added classes to apply a white background, rounded corners, padding, and margin on the y-axis (top and bottom) to the form.

	```html
	<form class="bg-white my-4 p-4 rounded">
	```

  * 🔑 The spacing properties for margin and padding can be extremely useful to create or remove space in areas instead of needing to use custom CSS.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Which class was used to center the content vertically on the page: `justify-content-center` or `align-items-center`?

  * 🙋 We used `align-items-center`, because the term "align" is used when adjusting flexbox elements vertically in a row.

  * ☝️ Where do we think Bootstrap falls a bit short and requires us to build custom styles?

  * 🙋 The colors are preset, so we would need to use our own styles if we want different ones.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 2, read the [Bootstrap documentation on utilities](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/utilities), and attend Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Instructor Demo: jQuery UI (5 min)

* Open `05-jQuery-UI/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

	* We see a Skills List page with a Skills Form and a List of Skills.

	* When we add a skill name and date, it is added to the List of Skills.

	* 🔑 When typing a skill name, the word is autocompleted before we finish typing the full word.

	* 🔑 When choosing the date, a datepicker is shown to help us choose a date from a calendar.

	* 🔑 If we add a few more skills to the list and move them around, they can be arranged in a different order.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used jQuery UI to convert to-do lists into sortables in Lesson 3.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 jQuery UI can be used to add functionality to our application.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We would need to read the jQuery UI documentation to understand how to use the various jQuery UI widgets and interactions.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 10. Student Do: jQuery UI (20 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `05-jQuery-UI/README.md`, which are also shown below.

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

	```md
	# 📐 Add Comments to Implementation of jQuery User Interface Interactions

	Work with a partner to add comments that describe the functionality of the code found in [/js/script.js](./Unsolved/assets/js/script.js).

	## 📝 Notes

	Refer to the documentation:

	[jQuery User Interface docs on sortable](https://jqueryui.com/sortable/)

	[jQuery User Interface docs on autocomplete](https://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/)

	[jQuery User Interface docs on datepicker](https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/)

	[jQuery User Interface docs on disable selection](https://api.jqueryui.com/disableselection/)

	---

	## 🏆 Bonus

	If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

	* Can we implement drag-and-drop functionality without using jQuery?

	Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
	```

### 11. Instructor Review: jQuery UI (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points (✔️):

  * ✔️ Autocomplete widget

  * ✔️ Datepicker widget

  * ✔️ Sortable interaction

* Open `05-jQuery-UI/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

	* 🔑 If we look at the [jQuery UI documentation on autocomplete](https://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/), we see that we need to create an array for the `.autocomplete()` function to find and select from.

      ```js
      // Autocomplete widget
      $(function () {
        var skillNames = [
          'Bootstrap',
          'C',
          'C++',
          'CSS',
          'Express.js',
          'Git',
          'HTML',
          'Java',
          'JavaScript',
          'jQuery',
          'JSON',
          'MySQL',
          'Node.js',
          'NoSQL',
          'PHP',
          'Python',
          'React',
          'Ruby',
        ];
      ```

  * Then we look for the element that has an id of `skill-name` (which, in this case, is the `<input>` element) and apply the `.autocomplete()` function to it. This will check to see if what is being typed is one of the values of the `skillNames` array that we just created.

    ```js
    $('#skill-name').autocomplete({
      source: skillNames,
    });
    ```

  * 🔑 If we look at the [jQuery UI documentation on datepicker](https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/), we see that we have a lot of choices when it comes to customizing it. For the purpose of this activity, we want to show the month and year in dropdowns instead of the static month/year header.

  * So we look for the ["display month and year dropdown" option](https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#dropdown-month-year) and apply the additional Boolean options.

    ```js
    // Datepicker widget
    $(function () {
      $('#datepicker').datepicker({
        changeMonth: true,
        changeYear: true,
      });
    });
    ```

  * According to the [jQuery UI documentation on sortable](https://jqueryui.com/sortable), we need to use the sortable interaction in order to allow the user to drag and reorder the skills listed under List of Skills.

  * 🔑 We look for the element that has an id of `skills-list`, which is the List of Skills that will get populated by the user, and apply the `.sortable()` function to it.

    ```js
    $(function () {
      $('#skills-list').sortable();
      $('#skills-list').disableSelection();
    });
    ```

  * 🔑 However, we also want to add the option of seeing the whitespace between the items shift. By using the ["drop placeholder" option](https://jqueryui.com/sortable/#placeholder), we can do just that.

    ```js
    $(function () {
      $('#skills-list').sortable({
        placeholder: 'ui-state-highlight',
      });
        $('#skills-list').disableSelection();
    });
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What is the difference between the sortable interaction and the draggable and droppable interactions?

  * 🙋 The draggable interaction allows you to move an item anywhere on the screen. The droppable interaction is similar, but you need to drag the item and drop it on a target.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 3, read the [jQuery UI demos](https://jqueryui.com/demos/), and attend Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding.

### 12. Recap & Promote Additional Resources (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What do you think you absolutely need to know to succeed at the Challenge?

    * 🙋 To succeed at the Challenge, we need to know how to build user interfaces using Bootstrap components with grid layout and jQuery for functionality.

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it is not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful.

    * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

    * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the Challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

* Direct students to the additional resources available to them:

    * Reflection and Retrieval

    * Career Connection

    * Dessert Menu

### 13. Introduce Upcoming Challenge (5 min)

* Open `01-Class-Content/06-Server-Side-APIs/02-Challenge/Main/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

    * In the next Challenge, we will build a weather dashboard that runs in the browser.

    * When we enter a city in the search box, we receive the current forecast, temperature, and humidity.

    * We also receive a 5-day forecast nicely displayed in its own boxes with all the relevant information.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What are we learning?

    * 🙋 We are learning to use `fetch` to make complex API calls and JavaScript to dynamically display responses to the browser.

    * ☝️ How does this project build on or extend previously learned material?

    * 🙋 We need a firm understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build this project.

    * ☝️ How does this project relate to your career goals?

    * 🙋 Creating attractive UIs and displaying responses from API requests are a big part of web development and an important skill to have.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.
