# 05.1 Virtual Class: Third-Party APIs

## Overview

In today's virtual class, students will perform DOM manipulations that they're already familiar with, except this time we'll be using jQuery.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Attach event listeners and their corresponding event handling functionality.

* Delegate events for elements that have been dynamically created.

## Instructor Notes

* Review the solution to `03-Algorithms/01-fizz-buzz`and share it with students before class.

* Use the student check-in to gauge their comprehension of the material so far. A Fist to Five activity is scripted below, but feel free to make an assessment using other means, such as a poll.

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* Take a few minutes before class to become familiar with the [jQuery API documentation](https://api.jquery.com/), as students will rely heavily on it in class and might need help finding answers.

* Throughout class, reiterate often that the DOM methods that we have used previously -- such as `document.getElementById`, `document.createElement`, and `Element.innerHTML` -- all have corresponding jQuery methods and a powerful selector feature that allows us to select elements in the DOM.

* Students might feel stuck when trying to learn the correct syntax. Encourage them by letting them know that the interface gets easier to understand with practice and time.

* If students question why they are learning jQuery when they have already learned how to manipulate the DOM using plain JavaScript, tell them that it is due to the longstanding prevalence and popularity of jQuery on the web. Also, knowing how to learn new libraries and measure their benefits is an important skill to have.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* When reviewing activities, ask for volunteers to share their solutions and/or ask students to walk through the solution line-by-line.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* It can be helpful to students if you share your personal experiences with learning and working with the concepts covered in this lesson.

* In the asynchronous content, students learned about click events and event delegation in Lesson 1.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Invite students to post questions in the Zoom chat so TAs and/or the instructor can address them at the end of class.

* Open the lesson [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1suBgogND_v6gyYMN-GnJMXQdSyZ5zed5H0-_XDMV71g/edit?usp=sharing) and walk through the following slides on foundation setting:

  **The Big Picture**: This is an opportunity to look at the big picture of where students are in the course. Take a moment to discuss a few real-world examples of why this week's topics are valuable.

  **Boot Camp Pointers**: Review some logistics that will help students stay on track. This is an opportunity to speak to what students might need at this particular point in the course.

  **This Week: Third-Party APIs**: Review the key skills students will be learning this week.

  **This Week's Assignment**: Give a quick summary of this week's Challenge assignment and describe how the skills they learn throughout the week will be applied to it.

  **Career Connection**: Reinforce that students will use the skills they learn this week throughout their careers. It's important for them to know the "why" and "how" behind the "what." Give examples of how these skills are used on the job. If you feel comfortable, share examples of how you have used them in your professional career.

  * Students are "heads down" now as they focus on understanding JavaScript, Web APIs, and third-party APIs. This intense concentration might lead them to forget how important is it to keep up with career services content.

  * Remind students to complete the following employer-ready and employer-competitive tasks that were assigned to them in the weekly Career Connection:

    * Enhance their portfolio using jQuery. Can they animate something using the jQuery animation library? Or they might choose to implement some other jQuery functionality that they learned this week.

    * The Technical Skills section of their resume should now display jQuery next to HTML and CSS. Companies still frequently use jQuery, so it's important to list it as a skill.

  * Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What is a technical interview?

    * üôã The technical portion of the interview might be an in-person whiteboarding format or it might use an online assessment platform, such as HackerRank, to assess technical proficiency.

    * ‚òùÔ∏è How can we prepare for technical interviews?

    * üôã Practice!

  **How to Succeed This Week**: Remind students that they might experience moments of frustration as they learn complex concepts and tools, and that these times are actually proven opportunities to deepen knowledge. Consider sharing something about your personal learning journey. This helps students recognize that everyone starts somewhere, that being a developer means constantly learning new technologies, and that they are not alone.

  **Today's Agenda**: Outline the concepts that will be covered in today's lesson. Remind students that they can find the relevant activity files in the "Getting Ready for Class" page in their course content.

### 2. Instructor Do: Student Check-In (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How are you feeling about your progress so far?

  * üôã We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back at what we accomplished and acknowledge that it is a lot! It‚Äôs also okay to feel overwhelmed -- as long as we don‚Äôt give up!

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with this topic?

  * üôã Let's do Fist to Five together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 3. Instructor Demo: Click Events (5 min)

* Open `01-Click-Events/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë This is a password generator. When we click the "Generate Password" button, we see a 15-character password generated.

  * üîë In your student activity, there is a bug in the `script.js` file that is preventing the button from working correctly. You'll need to find and fix that bug.

* Ask the class the following questions and call on students for the corresponding answers:

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Where have we used this before?

  * üôã In Lesson 1, we used a click event listener on the "Save Changes" button of the "Add New Task" form in the modal for Taskmaster.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

  * üôã We will need to use click events on buttons in the Challenge.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?

  * üôã We should check which event listener is on the button.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Click Events (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-Click-Events/README.md`, which are also shown here:

  ```md
  # üêõ Password Generator Does Not Work on Single Click

  Work with a partner to resolve the following issues:

  * As a user, I should be able to click the "Generate Password" button.

  * As a user, I should be able to single-click the "Generate Password" button to generate a new password.

  * As a user, I should be able to generate a 15-character password upon click.

  ## Expected Behavior

  When a user single-clicks the "Generate Password" button, a 15-character password is printed to the page.

  ## Actual Behavior

  When a user single-clicks the "Generate Password" button, nothing happens.

  ## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

  Follow these steps to reproduce the problem:

  1. Open `index.html` in the browser.

  2. Click the "Generate Password" button to see that nothing happens.

  ## Assets

  The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

  ![On the password generator app, an input field is filled by a random password.](./Images/01-solution-screenshot.png)

  ---

  ## üí° Hint

  * How can we ensure that our HTML elements have the correct event listeners attached to them?

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed the activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What are alternate methods to add event listeners? Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to answer this question.
  ```

### 5. Instructor Review: Click Events (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points (‚úîÔ∏è):

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Correct selector

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `click`, not `dblclick`

* Open `01-Click-Events/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * üîë The jQuery selector at the top of the file used the incorrect selector syntax, and should select by ID and not class:

    ```js
    var passwordBtnEl = $('#password-btn');
    ```

  * üîë Because the `.on()` method will listen for any valid browser event, we can simply change it to say `click`, not `dblclick`:

    ```js
    passwordBtnEl.on('click', function () {
    ```

  * After the password is generated, it is displayed to the element that `passwordDisplayEl` references:

    ```js
    var newPassword = passwordGenerator(15);
    passwordDisplayEl.text(newPassword);
    ```

  * We create the variables first, then the functionality, then the event listener bindings. This approach ensures that everything exists before we put it to use in the JavaScript.

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Could we listen for both click and double-click events on a single element?

  * üôã Yes! We can add a second `.on()` to an element to attach another event listener.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to Lesson 1, read the [jQuery documentation on mouse events](https://api.jquery.com/category/events/mouse-events/), and attend Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Event Delegation (5 min)

* Open `02-Event-Delegation/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë When we enter an item name and click the "Add Item" button, we see it added under the form.

  * üîë When we click the Remove button, the item is removed from the page.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Where have we used this before?

  * üôã We used event delegation to account for tasks that were dynamically created on the page when we added the ability to edit task descriptions in Taskmaster.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

  * üôã We will need to use event delegation to work with dynamically created elements.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?

  * üôã We need to traverse up to the parent element to know which list item to remove when the button is clicked.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Event Delegation (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Event-Delegation/README.md`, which are also shown here:

  ```md
  # üèóÔ∏è Implement Shopping List Item Deletion

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As an online shopper, I want to be able to remove items from my list.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It is done when each item's Remove button can be clicked to remove its respective shopping list item.

  ## üí° Hints

  * Use your knowledge in DOM traversal to select an element's parent.

  * The jQuery method for deleting an element is `.remove()`.

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed the activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What are some alternatives to using jQuery? Discuss the merits with your partner. You can read this [guide to whether you need jQuery](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/) to learn about some alternatives.
  ```

### 8. Instructor Review: Event Delegation (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points (‚úîÔ∏è):

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Event delegation

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `event.target`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `.parent()`

* Open `02-Event-Delegation/Solved/assets/js/script.js`in your IDE and explain the following:

  * üîë We can attach the `on()` event listener to the parent element, `shoppingListEl`, to listen for the click on the shopping list item buttons.

    ```js
    shoppingListEl.on('click', '.delete-item-btn', handleRemoveItem);
    ```

  * üîë In the event handler, we use `$(event.target)` to select the button clicked by the user.

    ```js
    var btnClicked = $(event.target);
    ```

  * üîë We use traversing with `.parent('li')` to select the first parent element that matches a `<li>` and remove it.

    ```js
    btnClicked.parent('li').remove();
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Are there any drawbacks with event delegating to ancestor elements&mdash;for example, `<html>`, because this element will always be guaranteed to load?

  * üôã Yes, all descendants of `<html>` that exist now or in the future matching the selector will fire the handler. Therefore it's best to select a parent closest to the target element to decrease the chances for errant function calls.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to Lesson 1, read the [jQuery documentation on event delegation](https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/), and attend Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Everyone Do: Git Revert (30 min)

* Open the [Git documentation on git revert](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-revert) in your browser and explain the following:

  * As you work with your teammates on projects and other collaborative assignments, there will be times when you might wish that you could undo a commit.

  * `git revert` isn't exactly an undo operation, but it will figure out how to invert the changes introduced by the commit and then append a new commit with the resulting inverse content. This way you are not losing any history, which is very important for the integrity of your revision history and for reliable collaboration with others.

  * Let's say that you are working with your classmates on a project and you are trying to fix a bug. You find out that the bug was caused by a single commit. You can use `git revert` to go fix it and commit a new snapshot.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `Git-Guide/README.md`.

* While everyone is working on the activity, be sure to remind students and instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. This is a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

* If necessary, you can review the activity with students.

* Open your command line, create a new directory, `cd` into it, and initialize a Git repo there:

    ```bash
    mkdir git_revert_demo
    cd git_revert_demo
    git init .
    ```

* Open the `git_revert_demo` directory in your IDE and copy the `Git-Guide/script.js` file into it.

* Let students know that we are taking the `script.js` file from the jQuery UI activity.

  * Before we test out the `git revert` command, we will need to make a few commits. Let's make the initial commit as follows:

    ```bash
    git add -A
    git commit -m 'initial commit'
    ```

  * Then we'll add the autocomplete widget to `script.js`:

    ```js
    // Autocomplete widget
    $(function () {
      var skillNames = [
        'Bootstrap',
        'C',
        'C++',
        'CSS',
        'Express.js',
        'Git',
        'HTML',
        'Java',
        'JavaScript',
        'jQuery',
        'JSON',
        'MySQL',
        'Node.js',
        'NoSQL',
        'PHP',
        'Python',
        'React',
        'Ruby',
      ];
      $('#skill-name').autocomplete({
        source: skillNames,
      });
    });
    ```

  * Then we commit the new code:

    ```bash
    git add -A
    git commit -m 'added Autocomplete widget'
    ```

  * We'll add the datepicker widget:

    ```js
    // Datepicker widget
    $(function () {
      $('#datepicker').datepicker({
        changeMonth: true,
        changeYear: true,
      });
    });
    ```

  * We commit the new code:

    ```bash
    git add -A
    git commit -m 'added Datepicker widget'
    ```

  * Lastly, we'll add the sortable interaction:

    ```js
    // Sortable interaction
    $(function () {
      $('#skills-list').sortable({
        placeholder: 'ui-state-highlight',
      });
      $('#skills-list').disableSelection();
    });
    ```

  * We commit again:

      ```bash
      git add -A
      git commit -m 'added Sortable interaction'
      ```

* Enter `git log` into your terminal to display the commit history for students.

  * üîë We see all four commits when we invoke `git log`. We can use `git revert <commit hash>` to revert back to before we made the commit that matches the commit hash.

* Copy the most recent commit hash from the log of commits in your terminal.

  * üîë Once we find the correct commit hash, we can copy the commit hash and use it in the git command, `git revert <commit hash>`. It should look something like this:

     ```bash
     git revert 601e2affb5fca3addd898cb09ef950c562338823
     ```

  * This will create a new commit, which will open the commit message editor prompting for a new commit message.

* Demonstrate to students how to `esc`, `Shift + Z`, and `Shift + Z` to exit out of the message editor.

* Open `script.js` in your IDE:

  * When we check the `script.js` file, we see that the sortable interaction is indeed gone.

* Run `git log` in your terminal and demonstrate the following:

  * We see that have a record of all the commits in the project history.

  * üîë We can also pass in `HEAD` instead of the commit hash, which will instead revert the latest commit:

     ```bash
     git revert HEAD
     ```

  * This action creates another new commit, which will again open the commit message editor prompting for a new commit message. We can press `esc`, `Shift + Z`, and `Shift + Z` to exit out of the message editor.

* Run `git log` in your terminal and demonstrate the following:

  * When we run `git log`, we can see the automatically generated commit messages for both of our revert commands.

* Answer any questions before proceeding.

### 10. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

  * üôã We covered click events and event delegation.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

  * üôã All of it! The field of web development is wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's unnecessary to know anything completely to be successful.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

  * üôã It's important for two reasons: to be fully prepared to start the Challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

  * üôã Lesson 1

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Answer any questions before ending class.
