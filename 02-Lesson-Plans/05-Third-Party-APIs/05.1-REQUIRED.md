# Module 05 Virtual Class: Third-party APIs

## Overview 

In today's virtual class, students will implement the Bootstrap grid system and build a simple application using jQuery event handlers.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Implement a layout using Bootstrap and the grid system with rows and columns

* Implement event handlers with jQuery using `.on()`


## Instructor Notes

* Use the introduction to gauge student comprehension of the material. A Fist-to-Five activity is scripted below, but feel free to make an assessment using other means, such as a poll.

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try and anticipate questions students may have.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* When reviewing activities, ask for volunteers to share their solutions and/or ask students to walk through the solution line-by-line.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, share your struggle and/or personal experiences learning and working with the concepts covered in this lesson.

* Review the solution to `/03-Algorithms/01-fizz-buzz`and share it with students prior to class. 

* In the async material, Bootstrap is first introduced in Lesson 2 where students are tasked with adding Bootstrap classes to match a mock up of the Taskmaster Pro webpage. jQuery is introduced in Lesson 3 where students are tasked with adding drag and drop functionality to the Taskmaster Pro webpage.

## Class Instruction 

### 1. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Invite students to post questions in the Zoom chat so TAs and/or the instructor can address them at the end of class.

* Open the [Slide Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1suBgogND_v6gyYMN-GnJMXQdSyZ5zed5H0-_XDMV71g/edit?usp=sharing) and walk through the following slides on foundation setting: 

  **Big Picture**: This is an opportunity to zoom out and look at the big picture of where students are in the course. Take a moment to discuss a few real-world examples of why this week's topics are valuable.

  **Boot Camp Pointers**: Review some logistics that will help students stay on track. This is an opportunity to speak to what students might need at this particular point in the course. 

  **This Week**: Review the key skills students will be learning this week. 

  **This Week's Assignment**: Give a quick summary of this week's Challenge assignment and describe how the skills they learn throughout the week will be applied to it.

  **Career Connection**: Reinforce that students will use the skills they learn this week throughout their careers. It's important for them to know the "why" and "how" behind the "what." Give examples of how these skills are used on the job. If you feel comfortable, share examples of how you have used them in your professional career.

  * Students are head down focusing on understanding JavaScript, Web APIs and now 3rd-party APIs too. It's a lot. With this, comes forgetting how important is it to keep on top of Career Services content&mdash;after all, the goal is a new career, right?

  * Remind students to complete the employer ready and employer competitive tasks assigned to them in the weekly Career Connection:

    * Enhance your portfolio using jQuery. Can you animate something using the jQuery animation library? Or you might choose to implement another jQuery functionality that you've learned this week.

    * The Technical Skills section of your resume should now proudly display jQuery next to HTML and CSS. Like we discussed, companies use jQuery all the time—so let them know that you can dance the jQuery jig!

  * Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What is a technical interview?

    * 🙋 The technical portion of the interview might be an in-person whiteboarding format, or it might be through an online assessment platform, such as HackerRank, to assess technical proficiency.

    * ☝️ How can we prepare for technical interviews?

    * 🙋 Practice!

  **How to Succeed This Week**: Remind students that they might experience moments of frustration as they learn complex concepts and tools, and that these times are actually proven opportunities to deepen knowledge. Consider sharing something about your personal learning journey. This helps students recognize that everyone starts somewhere, that being a developer means constantly learning new technologies, and that they are not alone.

  **Today's Objectives**: Outline the concepts that will be covered in today's lesson. Remind students that they can find the relevant activity files in the "Getting Ready for Class" page in their course content.

### 2. Instructor Do: Student Check-In (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

  * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back and see what we accomplished and acknowledge that it is a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic?

  * 🙋 Let's do Fist to Five together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 3. Instructor Demo: Bootstrap Text Layout (5 min) 

* Open `01-Bootstrap-Text-Layout/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 This application uses Bootstrap for its CSS framework.

    * 🔑 It is divided into rows and columns on a grid. 

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used this to create four responsive columns for tasks that were either "To do", "In progress", "In Review", or "Done", in Lesson 2.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge? 

    * 🙋 We need to use Bootstrap to implement the layout for the challenge. 

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We would first start by making a wireframe sketch to plan the layout, then translate that to HTML following Bootstrap's row / column grid system.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Bootstrap Text Layout (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-Bootstrap-Text-Layout/README.md`.

  ```md
  # Bootstrap Text Layout

  In this activity, you will use Bootstrap to implement a grid system.

  ## Instructions

  * Open [Unsolved/index.html](Unsolved/index.html).

  * Using Bootstrap, create the layout in the following image: 

    ![text-layout activity design](bootstrap-text-layout.png)

    * In the `<body>`, create a `<div>` with a `"container"` class.

    * Start creating your rows and columns.

    * Use `Lorem ipsum` for dummy text.

  ## Hint(s) 

  * Prior to coding, spend some time drawing the grid layout.

  * You may need to refer to the [Bootstrap grid system documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/).
  ```

### 5. Instructor Review: Bootstrap Text Layout (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ Bootstrap row / column layout

    * ✔️ Bootstrap grid system 

* Open `01-Bootstrap-Text-Layout/Solved/index.html` in your browser and ask the class the following question(s):

    * ☝️ How many rows are in this layout?

    * 🙋 There are four rows.

    * ☝️ How many columns are in row 1?

    * 🙋 There is one column

    * ☝️ How many columns are in row 2?

    * 🙋 There are four columns in row 2. Tricky!

    * ☝️ How many columns are in row 3?

    * 🙋 There are six columns in row 3. 

    * ☝️ How many columns are in row 4?

    * 🙋 There are 2 columns in row 4. 

* Open `01-Bootstrap-Text-Layout/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * We first import Bootstrap using the CDN.

    ```HTML
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css">
    ```

    * In our `<body>`, we first create a `<div>` with a `"container"` class.

    ```HTML
    <div class="container">
    ```

    * 🔑 We create our first row and first column.

    ```HTML
    <!-- Row 1 -->
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-12">
        <h1>Header</h1>
      </div>
    </div>
    ```

    * 🔑 Our second row contains four columns, three with content and one empty. To achieve this, we use the `col-sm-3` class. Because there is no content in it, we don't need to create a fourth `<div>`. 

    ```HTML
    <!-- Row 2 -->
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-3">
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Incidunt optio provident tempora amet, eveniet et, eum illum, culpa laborum dicta recusandae magni architecto. Illo saepe facilis, unde. Debitis, atque, doloremque?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-3">
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. At dolorum perferendis voluptates error ullam placeat repellendus. Repellendus error repellat veritatis recusandae voluptates earum rerum consectetur itaque, ipsam nihil. Alias, nemo.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-3">
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Dolores ratione sint ex porro excepturi non dolorum, ullam ea quae vel earum, soluta obcaecati natus. Eligendi iusto accusantium mollitia debitis assumenda!</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    ```

    * Our third row contains six columns. To achieve this, we use the `col-sm-2` class.

    ```HTML
    <!-- Row 3 -->
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-2">
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Consequuntur optio dolorem dolores odio alias perferendis, commodi cum. Natus libero cum dolore officia quia eveniet modi reprehenderit soluta ratione quisquam? Sequi.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-2">
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Consequuntur optio dolorem dolores odio alias perferendis, commodi cum. Natus libero cum dolore officia quia eveniet modi reprehenderit soluta ratione quisquam? Sequi.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-2">
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Consequuntur optio dolorem dolores odio alias perferendis, commodi cum. Natus libero cum dolore officia quia eveniet modi reprehenderit soluta ratione quisquam? Sequi.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-2">
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Consequuntur optio dolorem dolores odio alias perferendis, commodi cum. Natus libero cum dolore officia quia eveniet modi reprehenderit soluta ratione quisquam? Sequi.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-2">
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Consequuntur optio dolorem dolores odio alias perferendis, commodi cum. Natus libero cum dolore officia quia eveniet modi reprehenderit soluta ratione quisquam? Sequi.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-2">
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Consequuntur optio dolorem dolores odio alias perferendis, commodi cum. Natus libero cum dolore officia quia eveniet modi reprehenderit soluta ratione quisquam? Sequi.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    ```

    * Our last row contains two columns. To achieve this we use the `col-sm-6` class.

    ```HTML
    <!-- Row 4 -->
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Deleniti illo voluptates blanditiis nisi! Ullam dolore aspernatur, ratione error similique veniam iusto, labore repellat eaque nostrum optio doloribus illo nihil dolor?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Commodi sequi ex quam quia iste, nemo molestias dolor, qui dolorem voluptatibus ipsa maxime voluptas et deserunt porro repellendus veritatis nesciunt quisquam.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    ```

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

    * ☝️ Why did we wrap all of our content in a `<div>` with a `"container"` class?

    * 🙋 The `"container"` class imposes a fixed width on all content. 

    * ☝️ What does the `sm` in `col-sm-3` do?

    * 🙋 It ensure the layout renders appropriately on _small_ screens, such as smartphones in landscape mode.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understanding this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 2, read the [Bootstrap grid system documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: jQuery Sandwich Click (5 min) 
    
* Open `02-jQuery-Sandwich-Click/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 When we click one of the sandwich buttons, we are presented with two alerts: the first with a witty comment about the sandwich; the second a count of the number of sandwiches eaten. 

    * 🔑 When we resolve the alerts, an image of the sandwich is rendered in the browser. 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used this to convert Todo lists into Sortables in Lesson 3.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We are reviewing how to handle events, work with state variables and dynamically render HTML.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We first need to scaffold our application with HTML, including three buttons and an element to hold dynamically generated content. We then need to set up event handlers to listen for clicks and respond to those clicks with alert messages and an image.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 7. Student Do: jQuery Sandwich Click (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-jQuery-Sandwich-Click/README.md`.

  ```md
  # jQuery Sandwich Click

  In this activity, you will build an interactive application that tracks state and handles events.

  ## Instructions

  * Open [Unsolved/index.html](Unsolved/index.html).

  * Create a simple jQuery application with the following functionality:

    * Renders three buttons, each referencing a different type of sandwich. 

    * Has three global variables for tracking the number of sandwiches eaten.

    * When a button is clicked, a first alert displays a witty statement about the specific sandwich.
    
    * When the first alert is resolved, a second alert message displays the number of that specific sandwich the user has eaten.

  ## Hint(s)

  * You will need to use global variables to track state.

  ## BONUS

  * Render an image for each click event. You will need to declare an empty `<div>` with an ide of `#image-div` for this.
  ```

### 8. Instructor Review: jQuery Sandwich Click (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ Using state variables

    * ✔️ Handling events with jQuery `.on()`

    * ✔️ Setting HTML contents with jQuery `.html()`

* Open `02-jQuery-Sandwich-Click/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

    * We create three `<button>` elements, each with an `id` and corresponding content for our sandwiches.

    ```html
    <button id="pbj">Peanut Butter Jelly</button>
	  <button id="grilledcheese">Grilled Cheese</button>
    <button id="roastbeef">Roast Beef</button>
    ```

    * We declare an empty `<div>` with an id of `#image-div` for the bonus question.

    ```html
    <div id="image-div"></div>
    ```

    * ☝️ What is the purpose of this empty `<div>`?

    * 🙋 We will render images in it.

    * Next, we add jQuery to our document using a `<script>` tag. 

    ```html
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
    ```

    * 🔑 In another `<script>` tag, we declare three global state variables to count the number of sandwiches eaten.

    ```js
    var pbjCounter = 0;
    var grilledCheeseCounter = 0;
    var roastBeefCounter = 0;
    ```

    * 🔑 We declare three `.on()` methods, each listening for `click` events on a sandwich button, using the corresponding `id`.

    * Within our `on()` methods, we use the increment operator to increase the sandwich count.

    ```js
    $("#pbj").on("click", function() {
      alert("Mmm... Peanut Butter Jelly Time.");
      pbjCounter++;
      alert("You've eaten " + pbjCounter + " PB&J sandwiches");
    });
    ```

    * 🔑 For the bonus, the image is rendered using the `html()` method on the `<div>` with the id of `#image-div`. We set the `src` of the image to an external, third-party URL.

    ```js
    // BONUS
    $("#image-div").html("<img src='https://i1.wp.com/snotapwi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/PBJ-Sandwiches.jpg?resize=590%2C368&ssl=1' />");
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Why do we add our JavaScript (and jQuery files) at the bottom of the `<body>` element?

    * 🙋 To prevent our script from running before the DOM renders.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understanding this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 3, read the [jQuery `on()`](https://api.jquery.com/on/) and [jQuery `html()`](https://api.jquery.com/html/) documentation, and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

    * 🙋 We covered the Bootstrap grid layout using rows and columns, and jQuery event handlers using `.on()` and "click" events. 

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's unnecessary to know anything completely to be successful. 

    * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

    * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer. 

    * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

    * 🙋 Lesson 2 for Bootstrap, Lesson 3 for jQuery.

    * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Use student answers to transition to office hours.

### 10. Office Hours (30 min)

* Announce office hours and invite students to stay on the Zoom and start the challenge while they have live support from instructional staff.
