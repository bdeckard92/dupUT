# Module 05 Instructor Overview: Third-Party APIs

## Overview

In this module, students will learn how to use two popular APIs: Bootstrap and jQuery. They will also use Moment.js to manipulate and display time and date 

In this week's virtual classes, you will lead the review of the Web APIs used in the async content: Bootstrap, jQuery, and Moment.js. 

| Day  | Topic                  | Location |
| ---  | ---                    | ---      |
| 1    | Bootstrap Text Layout  | 5.2      |
| 1    | jQuery Click           | 5.1      |
| 2    | Bootstrap Card Layout  | 5.2      |
| 2    | Moment.js              | 5.4      |
| 2    | jQuery localStorage    | 5.3      |

## Overview of Asynchronous Material 

Why are students learning third-party APIs?

* Third-party APIs are libraries or frameworks that allow developers to incorporate additional functionality into your web application easily. In addition to gaining practice in implementing these popular APIs, students will also gain skills in reading third-party documentation.

* The Bootstrap API is a CSS framework that allows students to build responsive and functional mobile-first user interfaces easily by using an extensive list of pre-built components and classes. 

* jQuery is a lightweight JavaScript library that simplifies routine JavaScript tasks such as event handling, HTML document manipulation, and animation.

* Moment.js is JavaScript library that provides easy-to-use documentation and a simple set of methods to easily parse, manipulate and display date data. While no longer being actively maintained, Moment.js is still a great way for students to practice using a third-party API to manipulate their data and learn about the complexities of handling date and time data in their code.  

Throughout the async module this week, students will use third-party APIs to do the following:

* Learn what third-party libraries are and what purposes they serve.

* Implement third-party libraries into our application via a CDN.

* Use a library's documentation when implementing new features.

* Implement jQuery methods to easily manipulate the DOM*

* Create a UI using Bootstrap's pre-built CSS styles.

* Learn about the complexities of date and time functionality in JavaScript and implement a Web API to make date handling and manipulation easier.

* Implement timed events in JavaScript and how to use callback functions in setTimeout() and setInterval().


**Reminder:** If students need help with an async activity, encourage them to attend Office Hours for help! If you can’t get through all of it, remind them that they can lean on Learning Assistants with the AskBCS bot for more help.

## Virtual Classes

If your class started AFTER January 1, 2021, use these lesson plans:

* [Virtual Class 05.1](./05.1-REQUIRED.md)

* [Virtual Class 05.2](./05.2-REQUIRED.md)

If your class started BEFORE January 1, 2021, use these lesson plans:

* [Virtual Class (Recommended) 05.1](./05.1-RECOMMENDED.md)

* [Virtual Class (Required) 05.2](./05.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try and anticipate questions students may have.

* Students may struggle with this module as the shift from plain JavaScript to jQuery may be jarring. It may also be difficult for them to acclimate to the use of a CSS framework. If you are comfortable doing so, share your personal experiences with learning and working with the concepts covered in this lesson.

* Ensure that you are using the correct versions of jQuery and Bootstrap (v4).

* The module project and Weekly Challenge both use Moment.js, which is now considered a legacy project. Let students know that it's okay for them to still use it here, but offer suggestions to use native JavaScript functionality or another library for their date and time needs such as (date-fns)[https://date-fns.org/] or the native JavaScript [Date and Intl objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) to format dates. The [Moment.js project status page](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status/) offers direction for other solutions. 

### Common Pain Points

According to our class data, students might experience some of the following pain points throughout the week:

| Pain Point                          | Recommendation       |
| ---                                 | ---                  |
| The `this` keyword                  | Refer to Lesson 1 or the [MDN documentation on this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) |
| Deploying to GitHub Pages          | Refer to Lesson 5 or [Getting Started with GitHub Pages](Getting started with GitHub Pages)

## Career Connection

During each lesson that students work through, they will also view a Career Connection section that will tie together the academic content with Career Services and how this material will be applicable to them in their future career.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Director and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careerservicesonlineevents.splashthat.com/).

If you'd like more information on Career Services, visit the [Career Services resources page](https://mycareerspot.org/).

## Module Challenge

In this week's Challenge the students will create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The starter code uses the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time, but feel free to encourage students to use a different JavaScript solution to handle this functionality since Moment.js is considered a "legacy" project.

[Module 05 Challenge](../../01-Class-Content/{05-Third-Party-APIs/02-Challenge)

Specific skills students will need to implement in order to be successful:

* Implement third-party libraries such as Bootstrap, jQuery, and Moment.js

* Perform DOM traversals and manipulations with jQuery

* Use jQuery to save user input in local storage

* Work with the Bootstrap grid layout in HTML

* Work with Bootstrap components

* Add custom color styles to an existing CSS framework

* Work with custom fonts and icons via a content delivery network (CDN)

## Heads-Up

Next week you will divide students into groups for their first project. Groups of three are ideal. Create one or two groups of four if the class cannot be divided by three. Structure groups so that each group consists of a mix of students who are excelling and emerging and remind students that working in a diverse team is a valuable skill as working developer.
