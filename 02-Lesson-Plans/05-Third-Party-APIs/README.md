# Module 05 Instructor Overview: Third Party APIs

## Overview

In this week's virtual classes, you'll review Bootstrap, jQuery and Moment.js.

## Virtual Classes

[Recommended](./05.1-RECOMMENDED.md)

[Required](./05.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* Students may struggle with this module as the shift from vanilla JS to jQuery may be jarring as well as acclimating to use of a CSS framework.

## Heads-Up

* Next week you will divide students into groups for their first project. Groups of three are ideal. Create one or two groups of four if the class cannot be divided by three. Structure groups so that their team members consist of the following: 

    * one strong student 
    
    * 1 average student
    
    * 1 struggling student

* Next week you will introduce server-side APIs using `fetch`. If `fetch` is new to you, you will want to review prior to class.
