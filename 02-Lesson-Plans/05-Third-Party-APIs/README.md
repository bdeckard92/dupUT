# Module 05 Instructor Overview: Third-Party APIs

## Overview

In this module, students will learn how to use Bootstrap and jQuery, two popular APIs. They'll also use Moment.js to manipulate and display time and date.

In this week's virtual classes, you'll lead the review of the Web APIs used in the async content (Bootstrap, jQuery, and Moment.js).

| Day  | Topic                  | Location |
| ---  | ---                    | ---      |
| 1    | Bootstrap Text Layout  | 5.2      |
| 1    | jQuery Click           | 5.1      |
| 2    | Bootstrap Card Layout  | 5.2      |
| 2    | Moment.js              | 5.4      |
| 2    | jQuery localStorage    | 5.3      |

## Overview of Asynchronous Material 

Why are students learning third-party APIs?

* **Third-party APIs** are libraries or frameworks that allow developers to easily incorporate additional functionality into their web applications. Students will not only practice implementing these popular APIs but also learn how to read third-party documentation.

* **Bootstrap** is a CSS framework that allows us to easily build responsive and functional mobile-first user interfaces using an extensive list of prebuilt components and classes. 

* **jQuery** is a lightweight JavaScript library that simplifies routine JavaScript tasks like event handling, HTML document manipulation, and animation.

* **Moment.js** is a JavaScript library that provides easy-to-use documentation and a simple set of methods to easily parse, manipulate, and display date data. While it is no longer actively maintained, Moment.js is still a great way for students to practice using a third-party API to manipulate their data and learn about the complexities of handling date and time data in their code.  

Throughout the async module this week, students will use third-party APIs to do the following:

* Learn what third-party libraries are and what purposes they serve.

* Implement third-party libraries into an application via a CDN.

* Implement new features using library documentation.

* Implement jQuery methods to easily manipulate the DOM.

* Create a UI using Bootstrap's prebuilt CSS styles.

* Learn about the complexities of date and time functionality in JavaScript and implement a Web API to make date handling and manipulation easier.

* Implement timed events in JavaScript and use callback functions in `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()`.

**Reminder**: If students need help with an async activity, encourage them to attend Office Hours for help! If you can’t get through all of it, remind them that they can lean on Learning Assistants with the AskBCS bot for more help.

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to review the activities before class. Try to anticipate any questions that students might have.

* Students might struggle with the shift from plain JavaScript to jQuery in this module. They might also struggle to acclimate to a CSS framework. If you're comfortable doing so, share your personal experiences of learning and working with the concepts covered in this lesson.

* Ensure that you're using the correct versions of jQuery and Bootstrap (v4).

* The Module Project and Weekly Challenge both use Moment.js, now considered a legacy project. Tell students that they can still use it here, but suggest alternatives for their date and time needs. You can direct them to the [date-fns website](https://date-fns.org/) or the [MDN Web Docs on Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date). The [Moment.js documentation on project status](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status/) also provides other solutions. 

### Common Pain Points

According to our class data, students might experience some of the following pain points throughout the week:

| Pain Point                          | Recommendation                                                          |
| ---                                 | ---                  |
| Using the `this` keyword                  | Refer to Lesson 1 or the [MDN Web Docs on this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) |
| Deploying to GitHub Pages          | Refer to Lesson 5 or the [GitHub Docs on getting started with GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages) |

## Career Connection

During each lesson that students work through, they will also view a Career Connection section that will tie together the academic content with career services and how this material will be applicable to them in their future career.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Coach and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careerservicesonlineevents.splashthat.com/).

If you'd like more information on career services, visit the [career services resources page](https://careernetwork.2u.com//).

## Module Challenge

In this week's Challenge, the students will use starter code to build a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The starter code uses the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to handle date and time, but because Moment.js is considered a legacy project, feel free to encourage students to use a different JavaScript solution.

[Module 05 Challenge](../../01-Class-Content/05-Third-Party-APIs/02-Challenge)

Specific skills students will need to implement in order to be successful:

* Implement third-party libraries such as Bootstrap, jQuery, and Moment.js.

* Perform DOM traversals and manipulations with jQuery.

* Save user input in local storage using jQuery.

* Work with the Bootstrap grid layout in HTML.

* Work with Bootstrap components.

* Add custom color styles to an existing CSS framework.

* Work with custom fonts and icons via a **content delivery network (CDN)**.

## Heads-Up

* Next week you'll divide students into groups for their first project. Groups of three are ideal. Create one or two groups of four if the class cannot be divided by three. Structure groups so that they include the following: 

  * One advanced student 
  
  * One average student
  
  * One struggling student

* Next week you'll introduce server-side APIs using `fetch()`. If you're unfamiliar with `fetch()`, review it before class.
