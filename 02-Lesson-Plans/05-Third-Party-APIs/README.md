# Module 05 Instructor Overview: Third-Party APIs

## Overview

In this week's virtual classes, you'll review Bootstrap, jQuery and Moment.js.

## Virtual Classes

[Recommended](./05.1-RECOMMENDED.md)

[Required](./05.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try and anticipate questions students may have.

* Students may struggle with this module as the shift from vanilla JS to jQuery may be jarring as well as acclimating to use of a CSS framework.

* Ensure that you are using the correct versions of jQuery and Bootstrap (v4).

* Students will find `this` challenging. Review the `05-jQuery-Todo-localStorage` activity prior to class and be prepared to discuss `this`.

* The module project and Weekly Challenge both use Moment.js, which is now considered a legacy project. Let students know that it's okay for them to still use it here, but offer suggestions to use native JavaScript functionality or another library for their date and time needs. The [Moment.js project status page](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status/) offers direction for other solutions. 

## Career Connection

During each lesson that students work through, they will also view a Career Connection section that will tie together the academic content with Career Services and how this material will be applicable to them in their future career.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Director and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careerservicesonlineevents.splashthat.com/).

## Module Challenge

## Heads-Up

* Next week you will divide students into groups for their first project. Groups of three are ideal. Create one or two groups of four if the class cannot be divided by three. Structure groups so that their team members consist of the following: 

  * 1 advanced student 
  
  * 1 average student
  
  * 1 struggling student

* Next week you will introduce server-side APIs using `fetch`. If `fetch` is new to you, you will want to review prior to class.
