# Module 12 Instructor Overview: SQL

## Overview

In this week's virtual classes, you'll teach students MySQL schemas, creating databases and tables, and populating tables with data. You will also review `JOIN` statements, the `mysql2` npm package, and prepared statements.

## Virtual Classes

If your class started **AFTER** January 1, 2021, use these lesson plans:

* [Virtual Class 12.1](./12.1-REQUIRED.md)

* [Virtual Class 12.2](./12.2-REQUIRED.md)

If your class started **BEFORE** January 1, 2021, use these lesson plans:

* [Virtual Class (Recommended) 12.1](./12.1-RECOMMENDED.md)

* [Virtual Class (Required) 12.2](./12.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to install the [MySQL server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) before this week's classes and run the server to be able to initialize the MySQL Shell. 

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* Make sure the students install MySQL for this module. Detailed instructions are provided in the `Up and Running` for this module. 

* Remind students to complete the Midpoint Survey coming up that covers their journey thus far. Clarify that this survey is **not** about the current Module, but is about the entire course up until this point! It’s important that they are aware of this in advance and that they take their time to complete the survey. This will ultimately help us understand how the program, the curriculum, the instruction, and our support can be improved!

## Career Connection

During each lesson that students work through, they will also view a Career Connection section that will tie together the academic content with Career Services and how this material will be applicable to them in their future career.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Director and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careerservicesonlineevents.splashthat.com/).

## Module Challenge

[Module 12 Challenge](../../01-Class-Content/12-SQL/02-Challenge)

## Heads Up

* Next week you will introduce ORMs, more specifically Sequelize. BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO GO TOO IN DEPTH. There are a ton of components that make Sequelize work, but much of it is boilerplate that doesn't need much explanation. 

* THIS IS TOUGH STUFF! Tell your class to not feel discouraged if there are concepts that they can't nail down completely. Tell them to try their best, but to speak with you or a TA if they're unsure of anything.
