# Module 12 Virtual Class: SQL

## Overview 

In today's virtual class, students will learn about SQL schemas, creating databases and tables, and populating tables with data.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Understand the purpose of a schema

* Create a database and tables

* Seed a table with data

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* By now, students should have installed MySQL on their machines. If not, direct them to the "Up and Running" content in the async material for instructions.

* After starting up the MySQL server, make sure the students can initialize the MySQL command line prompt: `mysql -u root -p`. They will need their MySQL password.

  * Some macOS users may find that this doesn't work and get the error message, `command not found`. Students may need to add the following into their `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc` file:
 
    `export PATH="${PATH}:/usr/local/mysql/bin/"`

  * If Windows users get the `command not found` error, refer them to the [MySQL PATH documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-windows-excerpt/5.7/en/mysql-installation-windows-path.html) if they also get the error.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms and check if students have installed MySQL correctly and are able to do the activities without technical difficulties. 

* Feel free to share resources like [MySQL client commands](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql-commands.html) to help the students become familiar with MySQL. 

* In the async material, students create a schema and seed the table from the MySQL command line in Lesson 1.

## Class Instructions 

### 1. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Invite students to post questions in the Zoom chat so TAs and/or the instructor can address them at the end of class.

* Open the lesson's [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16JRBi30jrnrmm5S828oammi5IapfzVsAjSCsHsi06As/edit?usp=sharing) and walk through the following slides on foundation setting: 

  **Big Picture**: This is an opportunity to look at the big picture of where students are in the course. Take a moment to discuss a few real-world examples of why this week's topics are valuable.

  **Boot Camp Pointers**: Review some logistics that will help students stay on track. This is an opportunity to speak to what students might need at this particular point in the course. 

  **This Week**: Review the key skills students will be learning this week. 

  **This Week's Assignment**: Give a quick summary of this week's Challenge assignment and describe how the skills they learn throughout the week will be applied to it.

  **Career Connection**: Reinforce that students will use the skills they learn this week throughout their careers. It's important for them to know the "why" and "how" behind the "what." Give examples of how these skills are used on the job. If you feel comfortable, share examples of how you have used them in your professional career.

  * Students are likely to feel overwhelmed with the introduction of yet another coding language this week&mdash;SQL. 

  * Remind students to complete the employer-ready and employer-competitive tasks assigned to them in the weekly Career Connection. 

  * This week, students explored the prevalence of different types of SQL&mdash;including MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB&mdash;in their local area by searching on Indeed.com.

  * Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What were some of the in-demand varieties of SQL you found?

    * 🙋 Some varieties of SQL include MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MariaDB.

    * ☝️ How similar are the SQL varieties?

    * 🙋 Very similar! SQL is a highly marketable skill and if you know one variety, it is easy to move to another. During this class, we will focus on MySQ. . 
  
  **How to Succeed This Week**: Remind students that they might experience moments of frustration as they learn complex concepts and tools, and that these times are actually proven opportunities to deepen knowledge. Consider sharing something about your personal learning journey. This helps students recognize that everyone starts somewhere and that they are not alone.

  **Today's Objectives:** Outline the concepts that will be covered in today's lesson. Remind students that they can find the relevant activity files in the "Getting Ready for Class" page in their course content.

### 2. Instructor Do: Student Check-In (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

  * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back at what we accomplished and acknowledge that it is a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic?

  * 🙋 Let's do Fist to Five together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 3. Instructor Demo: SQL Schema (5 min) 

* Open `01-SQL-Schema/Solved/schema.sql` in your IDE and explain the following:

   * 🔑 We define our database in a schema. Databases are made up of collections of related data called tables. 

   * 🔑 To create a table, we use the `CREATE` command. We then add one or more fields to hold our data. 

   * 🔑 Tables can hold a variety of data types. For each field, we assign the data type we want to store. 

* Navigate to `01-SQL-Schema/Solved/` in the command line. and initialize the MySQL command line by typing `mysql -u root -p`. Enter your MySQL password. 

    * 🔑 We initialize the MySQL Shell by entering `mysql -u root -p` in the command line. When prompted, we enter our MySQL password. 

    * 🔑 We execute the `schema.sql` file using the `SOURCE` command and typing `SOURCE db/schema.sql;`
       
    * 🔑 We verify that the database has been created using the `SHOW` command and typing `SHOW DATABASES;`

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 In Lesson 1, we executed the `schema.sql` file and verified the database using the MySQL Shell.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

    * 🙋 In the challenge activity, we will use a `schema.sql` file to create a database. 

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We create the `schema.sql` file to create the database and table and execute the file in the MySQL Shell. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: SQL Schema (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-SQL-Schema/README.md`, which are also shown here:

  ```md
  # 📖 Create Schema With Tables

  Implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to add two tables to my MySQL database. 

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when the schema includes two tables.

  * It's done when each table has at least three fields and each field has an assigned data type.

  * It's done when each table includes an `id` field that does not accept `NULL` values.

  ## 📝 Notes

 For this activity, feel free to choose the name of each table and field as well as the assigned data type. 

  Refer to the documentation: 

  [MySQL Docs on Creating a Table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/creating-tables.html).

  [MySQL Docs on Data Types](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/data-types.html)

  ## 💡 Hints

  * What MySQL command do we use to display a table and information about each field's data types? 

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What are some issues we can avoid by having a well designed schema?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.

  ```

### 5. Instructor Review: SQL Schema (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points (✔️):

    * ✔️ `USE inventory_db;`

    * ✔️ `CREATE TABLE`

    * ✔️ `Data Types`

    * ✔️ `NOT NULL`

    * ✔️ `DESCRIBE books`

* Open `01-SQL-Schema/Solved/schema.sql` in your IDE and explain the following:

    * 🔑 We add `USE inventory_db` to specify the database where the tables will be added.
  
      ```sql
      USE inventory_db;
      ```

    * 🔑 We use the `CREATE` command to add a new table. In my case, the table is named `books`.
  
      ```sql
      CREATE TABLE books(
      );
      ```

    * 🔑 For each field in the `books` table, we add a data type. 
  
      ```sql
      CREATE TABLE books(
        id INTEGER NOT NULL,
        book_name VARCHAR(30),
        book_description TEXT,
        category_name VARCHAR(30),
        price DECIMAL(10,2),
        in_stock BOOLEAN 
      );
      ```

    * 🔑 We use the `CREATE` command to add a second table named `categories`. We set the `id` field to `NOT NULL` so the field must always contain a value.

      ```sql
      CREATE TABLE categories(
        id INTEGER NOT NULL,
        category_name VARCHAR(30),
        category_description TEXT
      );    
      ```

    * We use the `DESCRIBE` command in the MySQL Shell to test that the new tables `books` and `categories` have been successfully created and have the right data types.

      ```sql
      DESCRIBE books;
      DESCRIBE categories;
      ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Why do we drop the `inventory_db` if it exists?

    * 🙋 We use the `DROP` command before adding a new database so that we can start fresh. If a database is already named `inventory_db`, it will be first be dropped. Then, we will be able to add our new database without error. 

    * ☝️ Why do we need a schema?

    * 🙋 A schema describes the data we want to store in our database and serves as a template for our tables. 

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 1, read the [MySQL documentation on schemas](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/getting-information.html), and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: SQL Seeds (5 min) 

* Navigate to `02-SQL-Seeds/Solved/` in the command line and initialize the MySQL command line. Demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 After we initialize the MySQL command line, we set up the database by typing: `source db/schema.sql`

    * 🔑 Then we can seed the database by typing: `source db/seeds.sql`

    * 🔑 We can verify that the `authors` table was populated with data by querying the database: `SELECT * FROM inventory_db;` 
  
* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We seeded the `candidates` table in Lesson 1.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

    * 🙋 We will need to build and seed databases in MySQL for the Challenge.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We write the MySQL commands in the `seeds.sql` file and execute the commands in the MySQL Shell. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: SQL Seeds (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-SQL-Seeds/README.md`, which are also shown here:

  ```md
  # 🏗️ Seed Table Data

  Implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to add data to my database tables.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when the `books` table has five rows of data.

  * It's done when the `categories` table has at least two rows of data.

  * It's done when the `prices` table has at least one row of data. 

  * It's done when the tables do not include `NULL` values. 

  ## 💡 Hints

  What MySQL command do we use to select and display a table and it's populated data? 

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What MySQL command do we use to add data to a table?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.

  ```

### 8. Instructor Review: SQL Seeds (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points (:key:) below to review the following key points (✔️):

    * ✔️ `INSERT INTO`

    * ✔️ `VALUES`

* Open `02-SQL-Seeds/Solved/seeds.sql` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 We use the `INSERT INTO` statement to specify which table we are adding data to and which columns they belong in. 

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO books (id, book_name)
    ```

  * 🔑 Then we use `VALUES` to insert values into the fields, separating each row with a comma.  

    ```sql
    VALUES 
      (1, "Pride and Prejudice"),
      (2,"Dracula"),
      (3,"100 Years of Solitude"),
      (4,"The Epic of Gilgamesh"),
      (5, "The Waiting Years");
    ```

  * To insert a single row into our `prices` table, we do the same thing, using the `INSERT INTO` command to select the table and `VALUES` to add the row's values.

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO prices (id, price) VALUES (1, 10.55);
    ```
    
  * To execute our `seeds.sql` file, we use the `SOURCE` command in the MySQL Shell.

    ```sql
    SOURCE db/seeds.sql;
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What are the benefits of seeding a table?

    * 🙋 Seeding a table provides sample data that will allow us to test our queries and interact with the database.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 1, read the the MySQL documentation on [loading data into a table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/loading-tables.html), and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

    * 🙋 We learned how to create a database and tables in MySQL, which is the database engine we will use for future modules. We also learned how to seed data into the databases.

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful. 

    * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

    * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the Challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer. 

    * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

    * 🙋 Lesson 1 covered SQL queries and executing SQL files to modify databases.

    * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Use student answers to transition to Office Hours.

### 10. Office Hours (30 min)

* Announce Office Hours, and invite students to stay on the Zoom and start the Challenge while they have live support from instructional staff.
