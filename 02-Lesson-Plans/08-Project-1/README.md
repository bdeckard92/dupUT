# Module 08 Instructor Overview: Project 01

## Overview

In this module, students will continue to work on their projects and then will present them to the class. They'll also update their professional materials, including their portfolio, GitHub profile, resume, and LinkedIn profile.

## Virtual Classes

Here are the lesson plans for this week's virtual classes:

* [08.1 Virtual Class](./08.1-REQUIRED.md)

* [08.2 Virtual Class](./08.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* Early in the week, share the [project presentation template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10QaO9KH8HtUXj__81ve0SZcpO5DbMbqqQr4iPpbwKks/edit?usp=sharing) with students so they have ample time to prepare for their presentations.

* Students must have a deployed project by presentation day, so encourage students to deploy their projects by the class before presentation day at the latest. Deployed projects can always be updated, so it is recommended that students deploy early on and update their live version with every new feature.

* Prepare a slide deck of superlative awards to give to each group. Use this [example of a superlative awards slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fJGzsclaQ5TKBk3EnL7Gc-bg1ijSGM6_oB1gvpKYnZE/edit?usp=sharing), and feel free to customize it for your cohort.

* Divide this week's second virtual class time by the number of groups presenting in order to give each group enough time to discuss their projects. Be sure to leave time for you and the TAs to present superlatives at the end of class.

* Be prepared to demonstrate the [Module 09 Challenge](../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/02-Challenge) at the end of the second virtual class, after presentations.

## Career Connection

Remind students that this module's Career Connection consists of updating their portfolio with this project as well as updating their GitHub profile, resume, and LinkedIn profile.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Coach and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for career services workshops](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp).

If you'd like more information on career services, visit the [career services resources page](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp).
