## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What did you learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

    * 🙋 @TODO We learned { X, Y & Z }. We are moving fast compared to traditional learners. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ Did anyone have an "Aha!" or "Eureka!" moment this week? When was it and why did things suddenly click for you? 

    * 🙋 Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we're thinking about it.

    * ☝️ Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

    * 🙋 It's easy to get stuck when you're learning web development. It's important to learn how to get unstuck because it happens to the pros too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the tool's official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups are great because explaining your problems to someone else often reveals the solution. 


### 2. Project Presentations & Superlatives (100 min)




### 3. Recap & Promote Additional Resources (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What do you think you absolutely need to know to succeed at the challenge?

    * 🙋 @TODO { YES, WHAT? }

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it is not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful. 

    * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material prior to class as possible?

    * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

* Direct students to the additional resources available to them:

    * Reflection and Retrieval

    * Career Connection

    * Dessert Menu

### 4. Introduce Upcoming Challenge (5 min)

* Run `@TODO/folder/file { AND ARGS, IF ANY }` from the command line and demonstrate the following: 

    * @TODO { WHAT ARE WE GOING TO BE BUILD? }

    * @TODO { ISN'T THIS NEAT! A SOPHISTICATED OR MODERN APPLICATION OF A KEY TOPIC. }

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What are we learning?

    * 🙋 @TODO { YES, WHAT? }.

    * ☝️ How does this project build off or extend previously learned material?

    * 🙋 @TODO {YES, WHAT? }.

    * ☝️ How does this project relate to your career goals?

    * 🙋 @TODO { HOW DO COMPANIES USE IT IN INTERESTING WAYS? HOW POPULAR OR IN-DEMAND IS IT? WHY IS THE PROJECT ENTICING TO EMPLOYERS? }

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Office Hours (30 min)

* Announce Office Hours and encourage students to stay on the Zoom and start the challenge while they have live support from instructional staff.
