## Overview 

In today's virtual class, students will present their projects in groups.


## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Demonstrate deployed projects

* Explain the technical implementation of their projects

* Describe their individual roles and contributions to their projects


## Instructor Notes 

* Keep an eye on time to ensure every group has an opportunity to present. 

* This is a major milestone for students. Be sure to congratulate them!

* If you haven't yet, prepare superlative "awards" to give each group at the end of this session.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What did you learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

    * 🙋 We learned how to design, build, and deploy a web application! We also learned to work collaboratively to do so.

    * ☝️ Did anyone have an "Aha!" or "Eureka!" moment this week? When was it and why did things suddenly click for you? 

    * 🙋 Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we're thinking about it.

    * ☝️ Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

    * 🙋 It's easy to get stuck when you're learning web development. It's important to learn how to get unstuck because it happens to the pros too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the tool's official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups are great because explaining your problems to someone else often reveals the solution. 


### 2. Project Presentations & Superlatives (100 min)

* Divide this time block by the number of student groups presenting.

* Present superlative 'awards' and congratulate each group for accomplishing this huge milestone!

### 3. Recap & Promote Additional Resources (5 min)

* Direct students to the additional resources available to them:

    * Reflection and Retrieval

    * Career Connection

    * Dessert Menu

### 4. Introduce Upcoming Challenge (5 min)

* Navigate to `02-Challenge/Main` in your command line and run `node index.js` and demonstrate the following: 

    * The upcoming challenge is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input.

    * We are prompted for information about our project. 

    * The application generates a markdown file that we can use in our projects as a professional README file. 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What are we learning?

    * 🙋 First, and most importantly, we are learning Node.js! We are also learning how to build an interactive command line application.

    * ☝️ How does this project build off or extend previously learned material?

    * 🙋 We are already familiar with a few command line applications, such as Git. Now we will learn how to create our own. We are also learning how to write server-side code. 

    * ☝️ How does this project relate to your career goals?

    * 🙋 Node.js is a popular JavaScript runtime environment used for both front- and back-end development.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Office Hours (30 min)

* Announce Office Hours and encourage students to stay on the Zoom and start the challenge while they have live support from instructional staff.
