# 08.2 Virtual Class: Project 1

## Overview

In this class, students will present their projects to their peers.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Demonstrate deployed projects

* Explain the technical implementation of their projects

* Describe their individual roles and contributions to their projects

## Instructor Notes

* Congratulate your class! This is a major milestone in their journey.

* Project presentations are a rare opportunity for students to practice speaking on technical topics in front of an audience of peers.

* Limit presentations to 10 minutes: 7 or 8 for the presentation itself followed by 2 or 3 minutes for Q & A. This will ensure that every group presents and allow padding for transitions between groups.

* Prior to class, prepare a list of questions to ask each group to encourage discussion.

* Prior to class, and during presentations if necessary, collaborate with your TAs to prepare a slide deck of superlative "awards" for groups. Refer to [this example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fJGzsclaQ5TKBk3EnL7Gc-bg1ijSGM6_oB1gvpKYnZE/edit?usp=sharing).

* In the next module, students will start using Node.js. Advise the students to have Node.js installed before coming to the next class! Direct students to the [Node.js installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/nodejs/how-to-install-nodejs).

* Remind students that this module's Career Connection consists of updating their portfolio with this project as well as updating their GitHub profile, resume, and LinkedIn profile.

* You will need to demonstrate the Module 09 Challenge at the end of class. Familiarize yourself with it prior to class.

## Office Hours

Use office hours to assist with any last minute debugging and deployment issues, or providing feedback on presentations.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Instructor Do: Welcome (5 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Address any last-minute questions before presentations.

### 2. Student Do: Presentations

* Project groups will have 10 minutes to present their project and have a brief Q & A.

* If there aren't many questions, ask the group to explain how they built their application and encourage them to speak technically to some of their code.

* Present superlative 'awards' and congratulate each group for accomplishing this huge milestone!

* In the next class, students will start using Node.js. Remind them to install it prior to class using the [Node.js installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/nodejs/how-to-install-nodejs).

### 3. Recap & Promote Additional Resources (5 min)

* Direct students to the additional resources available to them:

    * Reflection and Retrieval

    * Career Connection

    * Dessert Menu

### 4. Introduce Upcoming Challenge (5 min)

* Navigate to `02-Challenge/Main` in your command line and run `node index.js` and demonstrate the following:

    * The upcoming challenge is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input.

    * We are prompted for information about our project.

    * The application generates a markdown file that we can use in our projects as a professional README file.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What are we learning?

    * üôã First, and most importantly, we are learning Node.js! We are also learning how to build an interactive command line application.

    * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project build off or extend previously learned material?

    * üôã We are already familiar with a few command line applications, such as Git. Now we will learn how to create our own. We are also learning how to write server-side code.

    * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project relate to your career goals?

    * üôã Node.js is a popular JavaScript runtime environment used for both front- and back-end development.

* Answer any questions before ending class.
