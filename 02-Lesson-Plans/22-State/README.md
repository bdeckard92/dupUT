# Module 22 Instructor Overview: State

## Overview

In this week's virtual classes, you'll go over state management, particularly using React Context API. You will review how to create actions and reducers, test the reducers, implement global state, and introduce Redux.

You will also announce the upcoming final project during this week's Required Class.

## Virtual Classes

[Recommended Class](./22.1-RECOMMENDED.md)

[Required Class](./22.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* This last phase of the boot camp is more about being employer-ready, improving the skills they have already learned, and making their web applications more performant and efficient. Basically, students will focus on "Life after Boot Camp". 

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have. 

* **Important**: In order to avoid continuous NPM installs, all of this week's activities' Solved and Unsolved folders include only a `src` folder. Similar to Module 20, use the given web application [00-React-App](../../01-Class-Content/22-State/01-Activities00-React-App) and swap out the `src` folder for each activity. It's recommended that you completely restart the dev server between activities.

* The `05-Redux-Docs` activity is unique in that it isn't only a coding activity. In order to prepare the students for the challenge and also their career, the activity is about examining the official Redux Documentation. Emphasize to the students how important it is for them to be able to sift through documentation to find the right information that addresses the specific problem they're trying to solve at their jobs. 

* During this week's Required Class, information about the upcoming final project must go out!

  * This time, students will self-assign themselves into groups of 3. Be ready to step in and help out with making groups as necessary.

  * Look over the [project requirements](../../01-Class-Content/22-State/04-Supplemental/Project-Requirements.md). 

* All of the topics that the activities cover are from Lesson 1 in the async material.

## Career Connection

During each lesson that students work through, they will also view a Career Connection section that will tie together the academic content with Career Services and how this material will be applicable to them in their future career.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Director and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careerservicesonlineevents.splashthat.com/).
