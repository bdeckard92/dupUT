# Module 22 Instructor Overview: State

## Overview

In this week's virtual classes, you'll go over state management, particularly using React Context API. You will go over how to create actions and reducers, testing the reducers, implementing global state, and introducing Redux.

You will also announce the upcoming group project and the group members during this week's Required Class.

## Instructor Notes

* This last phase of the boot camp is more about being employer-ready, improving the skills they have already learned, and making their web applications more performant and efficient. Basically, students will focus on "Life after Boot Camp". 

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have. 

* **Important**: In order to avoid continuous NPM installs, most of this week's activities' Solved and Unsolved folders include only a `src` folder. Similar to Module 20, use the given web application [Book-Lounge](../../01-Class-Content/22-State/01-Activities/Book-Lounge) and swap out the `src` folder for each activity. It's recommended that you completely restart the dev server between activities.

* The `04-Redux-Docs` activity is unique in that it isn't a coding activity. In order to prepare the students for the challenge and also their career, the activity is about examining the official Redux Documentation. Emphasize to the students how important it is for them to be able to sift through documentation to find the right information that addresses the specific problem they're trying to solve at their jobs. 

* During this week's Required Class, information about the upcoming group project must go out!

  * Start thinking about project groups. This time, assign 3 students per group, all around the **same** skill level.  

  * Look over the [project requirements](../../01-Class-Content/).
