# Module 22 Instructor Overview: State

## Overview

In this week's virtual classes, you'll go over state management, particularly using the React Context API. You will review how to create actions and reducers, test the reducers, implement global state, and introduce Redux.

You will also announce the upcoming final project during this week's second virtual class.

## Virtual Classes

If your class started **AFTER** January 1, 2021, use these lesson plans:

* [Virtual Class 22.1](./22.1-REQUIRED.md)

* [Virtual Class 22.2](./22.2-REQUIRED.md)

If your class started **BEFORE** January 1, 2021, use these lesson plans:

* [Virtual Class (Recommended) 22.1](./22.1-RECOMMENDED.md)

* [Virtual Class (Required) 22.2](./22.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* This last phase of the boot camp is more about being employer-ready, improving the skills that students have already learned, and making web applications more performant and efficient. Basically, students will focus on life after boot camp.

* Be sure to prepare and review the activities before class. Try to anticipate any questions that students might have.

* **Important**: In order to avoid continuous npm installs, all of this week's activities' Solved and Unsolved folders include only a `src` folder. Similar to Module 20, use the given web application [00-React-App](../../01-Class-Content/22-State/01-Activities/00-React-App) and swap out the `src` folder for each activity. It's recommended that you completely restart the dev server between activities.

* Note that the included `00-React-App` includes a service worker out of the box, which means that it offers progressive web app capabilities with little to no configuration. The service worker is no longer included in the default behavior for the most recent version of the `create-react-app` utility. Be sure to communicate this to students to avoid setting expectations that Create React App, by default, will allow for progressive web applications. To create a React application that is ready to be a progressive web application using the `create-react-app` utility, refer to the [Create React App documentation on creating a PWA](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app/).

* The `05-Redux-Docs` activity is unique in that it isn't only a coding activity. To prepare the students for the Challenge and also their career, the activity requires them to examine the official Redux documentation. Emphasize to the students how important it will be on the job for them to be able to sift through documentation to find information that addresses the specific problem that they're trying to solve.

* Information about the upcoming group project must go out during this week's second virtual class!

  * This time, students will self-assign themselves into groups of 3. Be ready to step in and help out with making groups as necessary.

  * Review the [project requirements](../../01-Class-Content/22-State/04-Supplemental/Project-Requirements.md).

* All of the topics that the activities cover are from Lesson 1 in the async material.

## Career Connection

During each lesson that students work through, they will also view a Career Connection section that will tie together the academic content with Career Services and how this material will be applicable to them in their future career.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Director and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careerservicesonlineevents.splashthat.com/).

## Heads-Up

* Next week, students will start working on their last group project. Before this weekend, students must make their own project groups and be talking about project ideas within their groups.
