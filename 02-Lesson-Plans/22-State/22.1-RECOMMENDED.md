## Class Instructions 

### 1. Introduction (5 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Direct students to post individual questions in the Zoom chat to be addressed by TAs and/or at the end of class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

    * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back and see what we accomplished, and acknowledge that it's a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic? 

    * 🙋 Let's do "fist to five" together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).


### 2. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* [Click here for CodeSignal challenge](https://app.codesignal.com/public-test/AxFMTeyBvraiNL7H2/qzdetcA7ztuarH) 

* This is the last week that students will see any async content from Career Services. Remind them that by now they should have a completed:

    * resume

    * portfolio

    * GitHub profile with 5-6 pinned repositories

    * LinkedIn profile

* Each of these pieces should have been marked off by a Career Materials Advisor so that the student can be determined as "employer-ready". Only then will they gain access to things like our employer referral program. So encourage students to complete and submit these tasks asap if they have not already done so!

* In the meantime, ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Did anyone attempt the Code Signal algorithm?

    * 🙋 It is encouraged to take advantage of the CodeSignal practice because it reflects real-world online interviewing.

* Open your IDE and review the solution to the CodeSignal algorithm:

    * The algorithm is called `gimmeSomeSpace`

    * In this algorithm challenge, you are asked to write a function that returns the input string, `str`, with spaces between each letter.
    
    * For the purpose of this  assignment, you can assume that only strings will be passed as an input parameter

    * The instructions provide the following details regarding input and output:

    ```md
    [execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)

    [input] string str

    [output] string
    ```

    * We are also provided the following starter code:

    ```js
    function gimmeSomeSpace(str) {

    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝) and call on students for answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ This one isn't particularly complicated, especially in comparison to others we have tackled. That said, it does make you recall some array methods you might not have used for a while. So how can you tackle this?

    * 🙋 The first thing to do is to split each item in the string. Because it's a string, we can treat it like an array in JavaScript and just use the array method `.split()`.

    ```js
    const splitString = str.split('');
    ``` 

    * ☝And then how do we join it back together, but with spaces?

    * 🙋 Easy! Using the `.join()` array method, and remembering to pass in an empty space as the parameter.

    ```js
    const spacedString = splitString.join(' ');
    ```

    * ☝ Nice work! And then just remember to return it! But can you think of a way to do this in much less code? 

* If there's time, show students how you might optimize it to utilize less code!

* Full solution:

```js
function gimmeSomeSpace(str) {

    const splitString = str.split('');
    const spacedString = splitString.join(' ');

    return spacedString;
}
```

* Optimized solution:

* Remind students that we can chain array methods, and also return the entire value if it is just one line of code.

```js
function gimmeSomeSpace(str) {
    return str.split('').join(' ');
}
```

* Answer any questions students have before moving to the next activity.
