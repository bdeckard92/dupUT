# Module 21 Virtual Class: MERN

## Overview

In today's virtual class, students will implement React Router, create a JSON Web Token, and use the `useEffect` Hook to make HTTP calls using `fetch`.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Use React Router to tie a component to a URL route.

* Create and verify a JSON Web Token to log in the user.

* Use `useEffect` to make HTTP calls using `fetch`.

## Instructor Notes

* It is highly recommended that prior to class, you go through each demo and activity so that you are familiar with the code and can anticipate issues that students new to token based authentication and the MERN framework may face.

* **Important**: React Router recently [upgraded to version 6](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/upgrading/v5#upgrade-to-react-router-v6) which includes breaking changes with `<Switch>`, `<Redirect> ` and other elements. The content of this week's in-class and module activities uses React Router version 5. To make sure that students can follow along with activities -- as currently written -- please instruct students to use this npm command to install React Router version 5: `npm install react-router-dom@5`.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* JWT Tokens were covered in Lesson 2 and React Router was covered in Lesson 4.

* `useEffect` was not covered in the async material, however it is used in the Challenge. Use the class time to explain the activity and help students understand it so they can succeed in the Challenge.

## Office Hours

Encourage students to work on the remaining module algorithms during Office Hours. Review the algorithm solutions 5–10 minutes before class begins or during Office Hours after class.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What did you learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

  * 🙋 Instead of using RESTful API, we built our API with GraphQL. We are moving fast compared to traditional learners. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

  * ☝️ Did anyone have an "Aha!" or "Eureka!" moment this week? When was it and why did things suddenly click for you?

  * 🙋 Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we're thinking about it.

  * ☝️ Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

  * 🙋 It's easy to get stuck when you're learning web development. It's important to learn how to get unstuck because it happens to the pros too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the tool's official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups are great because explaining your problems to someone else often reveals the solution.

### 2. Review Current Challenge (5 min)

* Navigate to `01-Class-Content/21-MERN/02-Challenge/Main` from the command line and run `npm start`.

  * In this challenge, we are taking an existing book search engine and adding the ability to pull book data from the Google Books API on the front end, and allow users to save book searches to the back end.

  * However, this app utilizes GraphQL as an alternative to RESTful API patterns. You will use Apollo Server to fetch and modify data and Apollo Provider to make requests from the client side.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What recently acquired skills will help us build this challenge?

  * 🙋 This challenge is all about GraphQL! You will also use JSON Web Token to authenticate users.

  * ☝️ How are these skills relevant to a career in web development?

  * 🙋 While the RESTful API structure is well-known and widely used, they serve either too much or too little data. But with GraphQL, we set up a single API endpoint where we can retrieve as much or as little data as we need. Having this knowledge and ability to use both types of API structures will make you strong job candidate.

  * ☝️ How will this challenge improve your portfolio?

  * 🙋 Since GraphQL is a fairly new concept in the web development community, it will show employers how up-to-date your skill set is.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 3. Instructor Demo: React Router (5 min)

* Navigate to `03-React-Router/Solved` in your command line and run `npm install`, `npm run seed` and `npm run develop`.

* Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to demonstrate the following:

  * React Router is a library that allows us to easily add navigation and dynamic routing to our apps.

  * On this page, we can enter a comment and add our name. Once the comment is added, it will appear on the list below.

  * 🔑 We can also navigate to a new page by clicking on the link `Join the Discussion on This Thought` in the comment we just made. This will use the `thoughts` route followed by an id to navigate internally to a specific page.

  * 🔑 Notice that when we click on the link, the URL has also changed and now includes a `/thoughts` route followed by an id. We can copy and paste the URL into a new browser window and view the same page externally and even bookmark it to return to this page later.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We used React Router in Lesson 4.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  * 🙋 We will use React Router to create declaration routing for our app.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 React Router is a library that allows us to easily create a route for each page for our app. Once we create a route for a page in our app, the route can then be used by either entering the path into a browser window. The same route can also be used internally, when a user clicks on a link.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: React Router(15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `03-React-Router/README.md`.

  ```md
  # 🏗️ Implement Single-Thought Page Display

  Work with a partner to implement the following user stories:

  * As a user, I want to view individual thoughts and a list of comments.

  * As a user, I want to be able to bookmark a thought's page so I can come back and read more comments.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  The activity is complete when the following criteria are met:

  * When I select a thought on the homepage, I am taken to that thought's page to view its comments without reloading the page.

  * When I visit the thought directly in the browser, I am taken to that thought's page to view its comments.

  ## Assets

  The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

  ![The single thought's page displays the thought's information, its list of comments, and a form to add a new comment.](./Images/01-screenshot.png)

  ---

  ## 💡 Hints

  * How can the value of the `to` prop in each thought's `<Link>` component help us define our route?

  * How can we define a route with a parameter using React Router?

  * How can the `useParams()` hook be used to retrieve data to be used in the `useQuery()` hook?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * Which browser API does React Router leverage?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 5. Instructor Review: React Router (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `<Route exact path="/thoughts/:thoughtId">`

  * ✔️ `<Link to={`/thoughts/${thought._id}`}>`

  * ✔️ `useParams()`

* Open `03-React-Router/Solved/client/src/App.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 To navigate to the thoughts page, we first must define a route. Because the route is dynamic and will change based on the id of the thought we want to display, we use a `:thoughtID` parameter:

    ```js
    <Route exact path="/thoughts/:thoughtId">
      <SingleThought />
    </Route>
    ```

* Open `03-React-Router/Solved/client/src/components/ThoughtList/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * To access the page from inside our app, we use a link.

  * 🔑 Inside our map function, we create a link component that uses the route we just created. Then, we assign the value of the `:thoughtId` parameter to be the id of our current thought:

    ```js
     <Link
       className="btn btn-primary btn-block btn-squared"
        to={`/thoughts/${thought._id}`}
      >
    ```

* Open `03-React-Router/Solved/client/src/pages/SingleThought.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 To populate the data for the individual thought on our page, we first retrieve the id from the URL's parameter using the `useParams()` Hook:

    ```js
    const { thoughtId } = useParams();
    ```

  * 🔑 Then, we pass the retrieved id into a query to return the information needed to populate the page:

    ```js
    const { loading, data } = useQuery(QUERY_SINGLE_THOUGHT, {
      variables: { thoughtId: thoughtId },
    });
    ```

  * We can then use the returned data to display information on our page:

    ```js
    <h3 className="card-header bg-dark text-light p-2 m-0">
      {thought.thoughtAuthor} <br />
      <span style={{ fontSize: '1rem' }}>
         had this thought on {thought.createdAt}
      </span>
    </h3>
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are two ways we can access a page when we use React Router?

  * 🙋 We can access the page directly, by entering the URL of the page directly into the browser. If the path uses a variable, a value for the variable must be provided. We can also use a Link component to allow a user to click on a link and be directed to another page.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 4, read the [React Router Docs on Getting Started](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: JWT Signing (5 min)

* Open `04-Sign-JWT/Solved/utils/auth.js` in your IDE to demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 To generate a token in our apps, we start by adding a `auth.js` file to our server's `utils` directory and requiring the `jsonwebtoken` library to provide the functionality to check the validity of the token using a `secret` and `expiration`:

    ```js
    const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
    ```

  * 🔑 We then assign values for both a `secret` and `expiration`. The `secret` is a private key that signs the token and enables the server to verify whether the token is valid. The `expiration` is the length of time the token remains valid before expiring:

     ```js
     const secret = 'mysecretsshhhhh';
     const expiration = '2h';
     ```

  * 🔑 Next, we add a `signToken()` function to combine the payload, secret, and string and return our token as a string:

    ```js
    module.exports = {
    signToken: function ({ email, username, _id }) {
      const payload = { email, username, _id };
      return jwt.sign({ data: payload }, secret, { expiresIn: expiration });
    },
    };
    ```

* Open `04-Sign-JWT/Solved/schemas/resolvers.js` in your IDE to demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We call the `signToken()` function in the resolvers where we want to transmit data securely to generate a signed token:

    ```js
    addUser: async (parent, { username, email, password }) => {
      // First we create the user
      const user = await User.create({ username, email, password });
      // To reduce friction for the user, we immediately sign a JSON Web Token and log the user in after they are created
      const token = signToken(user);
      // Return an `Auth` object that consists of the signed token and user's information
      return { token, user };
    },
    ```

* Open `04-Sign-JWT/Solved/models/User.js` in your IDE to demonstrate the following:

  * We also need a way to handle a password in the resolvers. We start by importing `bcrypt`, a library that is used to safely store a password in the `Profile` model:

    ```js
    const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
    ```

  * Next, we add a save hook to encrypt a password when a new profile is created:

    ```js
    profileSchema.pre('save', async function (next) {
      if (this.isNew || this.isModified('password')) {
        const saltRounds = 10;
        this.password = await bcrypt.hash(this.password, saltRounds);
      }
      next();
    });
    ```

  * We also add an `isCorrectPassword()` method that checks to determine if the correct password was provided by the user:

    ```js
    profileSchema.methods.isCorrectPassword = async function (password) {
      return bcrypt.compare(password, this.password);
    }
    ```

  * We then export the model so the functionality can be used in our resolvers to handle our passwords.

    ```js
    module.exports = User;
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We learned about signing and verifying JWTs in Lesson 2.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  * 🙋 We will need to use JWT to add authentication to our Challenge apps.

  * ☝️ How do we build this?

  * 🙋 The `signToken()` function expects an object that contains data and will add that object's properties to a token. The `secret` and `expiration` are also added.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: JWT Signing (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Sign-JWT/README.md`.

  ```md
  # 📐 Add Comments to Implementation of JWT Signing

  Work with a partner to add comments that describe the functionality of the code found in [resolvers.js](./Unsolved/schemas/resolvers.js).

  ---

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What are the pros and cons of using JSON Web Tokens?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 8. Instructor Review: JWT Signing (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `User.create({ username, email, password })`

  * ✔️ `const token = signToken(user)`

  * ✔️ `User.findOne({ email })`

  * ✔️ `user.isCorrectPassword(password)`

* Open `04-Sign-JWT/Solved/schemas/resolvers.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We import the `signToken()` method and the `User` model to access the functionality needed in our resolvers to generate a signed token and check a password:

    ```js
    const { User, Thought } = require('../models');
    const { signToken } = require('../utils/auth');
    ```

  * 🔑 We then write an `addUser` resolver and pass in `username`, `email`, and `password` as arguments. This resolver will use our imported `signToken()` method:

    ```js
    addUser: async (parent, { username, email, password }) => {
    ```

  * 🔑 We use the data passed in to create a new user in the database:

    ```js
    const user = await User.create({ username, email, password });
    ```

  * 🔑 Next, we call the `signToken()` function to generate a signed token that includes the user information as the payload. The newly created `user` and `token` are then returned:

    ```js
    const token = signToken(user);
    return { token, user };
    ```

  * 🔑 For the `login` mutation, we pass in the `email` and `password` that we want to check against an existing user:

    ```js
    login: async (parent, { email, password }) => {
    ```

  * 🔑 We use the `.findOne()` method to search the database for a matching `email`:

    ```js
    const user = await User.findOne({ email });
    ```

  * If no user is found, we return an error message indicating there is no match:

    ```js
    if (!user) {
      throw new AuthenticationError('No user found with this email address');
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 If a match is found, we use the `.isCorrectPassword()` method from the `Profile` model to check if the password is also match:

    ```js
    const correctPw = await user.isCorrectPassword(password);
    ```

  * If there is no password match, we return an error. Otherwise, we use the `signToken()` function to generate a signed token that contains the user information:

    ```js
    if (!correctPw) {
      throw new AuthenticationError('Incorrect credentials');
    }
    const token = signToken(user);
    return { token, user };
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How do we update the mutation resolvers to generate a token that includes our data?

  * 🙋 We create a `signToken()` method that uses the `jsonwebtoken` library's `sign()` method to add a signature and expiration date to the data payload. Then, we import and execute the `signToken()` method in our resolvers.

    * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 2, read the [JSON Web Tokens documentation introduction](https://jwt.io/introduction/), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Instructor Demo: useEffect Fetch  (5 min)

* Navigate to `05-useEffect-fetch/Solved` in your command line and run `npm install` and `npm start` to demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 Before we search for anything, we see a GIF of a dog when the page is rendered.

  * 🔑 When we search for another GIF, like cat, the GIF is replaced with one of a cat.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We didn't use `useEffect` in this module, but if you remember, we learned it in Module 20 briefly and we will use it again in the next module. Also, this React Hook is used in the Challenge, so use this activity as an opportunity to practice and familiarize yourself with it so that you can succeed in the challenge.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  * 🙋 Although it wasn't covered in the async material, `useEffect` is used to make HTTP calls using `fetch`. You won't have to create any calls, but you will need to be able to read and understand what's going on.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 You will use `useEffect` to run the `handleSearchGiphy()` function so that it will display the GIF on the page after the page renders.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 10. Student Do: useEffect Fetch (20 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `05-useEffect-fetch/README.md`.

  ```md
  # 📖 Use the `useEffect` Hook to make HTTP Calls

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to use the `useEffect` Hook to make HTTP calls using `fetch` and a search term to the Giphy API.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when I use the `useEffect` to run the `handleSearchGiphy()` function with a search term of your choice as the argument.

  * It's done when a GIF is displayed on the page when the page is loaded.

  * It's done when I can search for another GIF and a new GIF is returned.

  * It's done when the result of the GIF search replaces the GIF on the page.

  ## 📝 Notes

  Refer to the documentation:

  [Using the Effect Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html)

  ## 💡 Hints

  How can you optimize performance by running effects once?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * How can you build your own hook?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 11. Instructor Review: useEffect Fetch (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ `handleFormSubmit()`

  * ✔️ `handleSearchGiphy()`

  * ✔️ `fetchGiphy()`

  * ✔️ `useEffect()`

* Open `05-useEffect-fetch/Solved/src/pages/SearchGiphy.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 Let's decipher what's doing on here. We have a form that will take in a search term upon submit. That is handled by the `handleFormSubmit()` function.

    ```js
    const handleFormSubmit = event => {
      event.preventDefault();
      if (!searchInput) {
        return false;
      }
      handleSearchGiphy(searchInput);
    };
    ```

  * 🔑 That search term `searchInput` is then handed off to the `handleSearchGiphy()` function.

    ```js
    const handleSearchGiphy = async query => {
      try {
        const response = await fetchGiphy(query);

        if (!response.ok) {
          throw new Error('something went wrong!');
        }

        const gif = await response.json();

        setSearchedGiphy(gif.data[0].images.fixed_height.url);
        setSearchInput('');
      } catch (err) {
        console.error(err);
      }
    };
    ```

  * 🔑 Notice how the search term `query` is used in the `fetchGiphy()` function for the `fetch` request.

    ```js
    export const fetchGiphy = (query) => {
      return fetch(
        `https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?q=${query}&api_key=HvaacROi9w5oQCDYHSIk42eiDSIXH3FN&limit=1`
      );
    };
    ```

  * 🔑 The response is then used to set the url of the `searchedGiphy` so that it shows up on the page. But the important part here is that until someone makes a search, nothing happens on the page. That's where `useEffect` comes in. After the page first renders, React will call `handleSearchGiphy()` with the search term you chose in your code. In our case, it was `dog`.

    ```js
    useEffect(() => {
      handleSearchGiphy('dog');
    }, []);
    ```

  * That's why you are able to see the GIF before you search for anything. By default, `useEffect` will run after every render. But we don't want that here. That's why we pass an empty array as a second argument. This tells React that your effect doesn't depend on any values from props or state, so it never needs to re-run.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are the two common kinds of effects in React components?

  * 🙋 Those that don't required cleanup and those that do. Sometimes we want to run some code after React has updated the DOM, like network requests, manual DOM mutations, and logging. These don't require a cleanup. But some effects, like setting up a subscription to an external data source, does require cleanup so that we prevent a memory leak. Both of these are possible using the `useEffect` Hook.

  * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can read the [Complete Guide to useEffect](https://overreacted.io/a-complete-guide-to-useeffect/) by Dan Abramov himself and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 12. Recap & Promote Additional Resources (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What do you think you absolutely need to know to succeed at the challenge?

  * 🙋 Since the challenge is all about refactoring a RESTful API into a GraphQL API build with Apollo Server, you will definitely need to have a firm grasp of GraphQL.

  * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

  * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it is not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful.

  * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material prior to class as possible?

  * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

* Direct students to the additional resources available to them:

  * Reflection and Retrieval

  * Career Connection

  * Dessert Menu

### 13. Introduce Upcoming Challenge (5 min)

* Navigate to `01-Class-Content/22-State/02-Challenge/Main` from the command line and run `npm start`.

  * We see a website where you can view shopping items and add them to the cart. We can then checkout and pay for the items.

  * But the real challenge is refactoring this e-commerce platform to use Redux instead of Context API. You will need to read through the Redux documentation to find the information you need to implement Redux.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are we learning?

  * 🙋 We are learning about complex state management. In the async material, we use Context API but in the challenge we will use Redux.

  * ☝️ How does this project build off or extend previously learned material?

  * 🙋 This project is the accumulation of everything we've learned so far! It utilizes the MERN stack and GraphQL.
