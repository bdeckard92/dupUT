# Module 21 Virtual Class: MERN

## Overview

In today's virtual class, students will create GraphQL mutations, make query requests from the client side, and use the `useEffect` Hook to make HTTP calls using `fetch`.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Create GraphQL mutations to add data to the database.

* Use query requests from the client side using Apollo Client.

* Use `useEffect` to make HTTP calls using `fetch`.

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* **Important**: React Router recently [upgraded to version 6](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/upgrading/v5#upgrade-to-react-router-v6) which includes breaking changes with `<Switch>`, `<Redirect> ` and other elements. The content of this week's in-class and module activities uses React Router version 5. To make sure that students can follow along with activities -- as currently written -- please instruct students to use this npm command to install React Router version 5: `npm install react-router-dom@5`.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* GraphQL Mutations were covered in Lesson 2 and Apollo Client was covered in Lesson 3.

* `useEffect` was not covered in the async material, however it is used in the Challenge. Use the class time to explain the activity and help students understand it so they can succeed in the Challenge.


## Office Hours

Encourage students to work on the remaining module algorithms during Office Hours. Review the algorithm solutions 5–10 minutes before class begins or during Office Hours after class.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What did you learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

    * 🙋 Instead of using RESTful API, we built our API with GraphQL. We are moving fast compared to traditional learners. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ Did anyone have an "Aha!" or "Eureka!" moment this week? When was it and why did things suddenly click for you?

    * 🙋 Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we're thinking about it.

    * ☝️ Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

    * 🙋 It's easy to get stuck when you're learning web development. It's important to learn how to get unstuck because it happens to the pros too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the tool's official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups are great because explaining your problems to someone else often reveals the solution.


### 2. Review Current Challenge (5 min)

* Navigate to `01-Class-Content/21-MERN/02-Challenge/Main` from the command line and run `npm start`.

    * In this challenge, we are taking an existing book search engine and adding the ability to pull book data from the Google Books API on the front end, and allow users to save book searches to the back end.

    * However, this app utilizes GraphQL as an alternative to RESTful API patterns. You will use Apollo Server to fetch and modify data and Apollo Provider to make requests from the client side.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What recently acquired skills will help us build this challenge?

    * 🙋 This challenge is all about GraphQL! You will also use JSON Web Token to authenticate users.

    * ☝️ How are these skills relevant to a career in web development?

    * 🙋 While the RESTful API structure is well-known and widely used, they serve either too much or too little data. But with GraphQL, we set up a single API endpoint where we can retrieve as much or as little data as we need. Having this knowledge and ability to use both types of API structures will make you strong job candidate.

    * ☝️ How will this challenge improve your portfolio?

    * 🙋 Since GraphQL is a fairly new concept in the web development community, it will show employers how up-to-date your skill set is.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 3. Instructor Demo: GraphQL Mutations (5 min)

* Navigate to `03-GraphQL-Mutations/Solved` in your command line and run `npm install` and `npm run watch` to demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 When we look at the GraphQL Playground running on <http://localhost:3001/graphql> in the browser, we can test the `addBook()` mutation by entering this in the left pane:

    ```js
    mutation addBook($title: String!, $author: String!, $pages: Int!) {
      addBook(title: $title, author: $author, pages: $pages) {
        _id
        title
        author
        pages
      }
    }
    ```

    * 🔑 In the Query Variables pane underneath, we need to add the following JSON:

    ```json
    {
      "title": "Mutation",
      "author": "Robin Cook",
      "pages": 356
    }
    ```

    * 🔑 When we run that, we can see the new book returned.

    * 🔑 Just to double check, we can run a query on all books to see if the new book is included:

    ```js
    query {
      books {
        title
        author
        pages
      }
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used mutations to add users and login users in Lesson 2.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We will use GraphQL mutations to add and modify data in our database.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We need to add a new `Mutation` type to `typeDefs` and add a `Mutation` property to `resolvers`.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 4. Student Do: GraphQL Mutations  (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `03-GraphQL-Mutations/README.md`.

```md
# GraphQL Mutations

In this activity, you will add a mutation to add a book to the library.

## Instructions

* Navigate to [Unsolved](Unsolved/) in your command line and run `npm install`.

* Open [typeDefs.js](Unsolved/schemas/typeDefs.js) and define a new `Mutation` type.

  * Add a `addBook()` mutation that takes in `title`, `author`, and `pages` properties and returns a `Book` object.

* Open [resolvers.js](Unsolved/schemas/resolvers.js) and add a `Mutation` property.

  * Add a `addBook()` resolver that creates a new book in the database and returns the new book.

* To check if everything is working properly, run `npm run watch` in your command line and open your browser to <http://localhost:3001/graphql> to view the GraphQL Playground.

  * In the query pane, test the `addBook()` mutation using the query variables `title`, `author`, and `pages` for a new book. You should be able to create a new book in the database.

  * To double check, run a query on all books and you should be able to see the newly created book.

* Press `CTRL + C` to stop the server before moving on to the next activity.

## Hint(s)

* You can refer to the [Apollo Server Docs on Mutation type](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/schema/schema/#the-mutation-type).
```


### 5. Instructor Review: GraphQL Mutations  (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ `addBook()` mutation

    * ✔️ `addBook()` resolver

* Open `03-GraphQL-Mutations/Solved/schemas/typeDefs.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

    * We add a new `Mutation` type to `typeDefs`.

    ```js
    type Mutation {

    }
    ```

    * 🔑 Inside it, we add a `addBook()` mutation that takes in a `title`, `author`, and `pages` properties and returns a `Book` object.

    ```js
    addBook(title: String!, author: String!, pages: Int!): Book
    ```

* Open `03-GraphQL-Mutations/Solved/schemas/resolvers.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

    * We add a new `Mutation` property to `resolvers`.

    ```js
    Mutation: {

    }
    ```

    * 🔑 Inside it, we add a `addBook()` resolver that takes in `parent` as a placeholder and `args` for the arguments. The Mongoose `Book` model creates a new book in the database and the resolver returns that new book.

    ```js
    addBook: async (parent, args) => {
      const book = await Book.create(args);
      return book;
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How can we validate data, like login information, coming from the client side?

    * 🙋 We can use `AuthenticationError` from GraphQL to return an authentication error if the user doesn't exist in the database or if the incorrect password is used.

    * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 2, read the [Apollo Server Docs on Mutation type](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/schema/schema/#the-mutation-type), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: GraphQL Client  (5 min)

* Navigate to `04-GraphQL-Client/Solved` in your command line and run `npm install` and `npm run seed`.

* If everything installed and seeded correctly, run `npm run develop` in your command line to demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 We see a GraphQL Library with a list of books, including the title, author, and number of pages for each book.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used Apollo Client in our React app to make a GraphQL query request for the list of thoughts in Lesson 3.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 Because the challenge uses a React app in the front end, we will need to know how to make GraphQL query requests.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We need to use a tagged template literal to create a query for all books in the front end. Then we need to use the `useQuery` hook to make the query request.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 7. Student Do: GraphQL Client  (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-GraphQL-Client/README.md`.

```md
# GraphQL Client

In this activity, you will make a GraphQL query request from the client side to get a list of books from the database.

## Instructions

* Navigate to [Unsolved/](Unsolved/) in your command line and run `npm install` and `npm run seed`.

* Take a moment to review the contents of the `client` and `server` folders.

* In the [src](Unsolved/client/src) folder, create a new folder called `utils`.

  * In the `utils` folder, create a new file called `queries.js` that will store the GraphQL query requests.

  * Using a tagged template literal, create a query to get all books from the database. You can name it `QUERY_BOOKS` and remember to export it.

  * You can check out the [typeDefs](Unsolved/server/schemas/typeDefs.js) for reference!

* Open [Home.js](Unsolved/client/src/pages/Home.js)

  * Import `QUERY_BOOKS` at the top of the page.

  * Use the `useQuery` hook to make a query request. Remember, the hook provides a `loading` and `data` property.

* To check if everything is working properly, navigate to [Unsolved/](Unsolved/) and run `npm start` in your command line.

  * You should be able to see a list of books with the title, author, and page number of each book.

* Press `CTRL + C` to stop the server before moving on to the next activity.

## Hint(s)

* You can refer to the [Apollo Docs on Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/).
```


### 8. Instructor Review: GraphQL Client  (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ `QUERY_BOOKS`

    * ✔️ `useQuery` hook

* Open `04-GraphQL-Client/Solved/client/src/utils/queries.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

    * First, we need to import `gql` from `@apollo/client` at the top of the page.

    ```js
    import { gql } from '@apollo/client';
    ```

    * 🔑 Then, using a tagged template literal, we create a query to get all books from the database, similar to how we've been doing it in GraphQL Playground.

    ```js
    export const QUERY_BOOKS = gql`
      query books {
        books {
        _id
        title
        author
        pages
        }
      }
    `;
    ```

* Open `04-GraphQL-Client/Solved/client/src/pages/Home.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

    * Notice `useQuery` hook and `BookList` have already been imported for us. We need to import `QUERY_BOOKS` from the `queries.js` file.

    ```js
    import { QUERY_BOOKS } from '../utils/queries';
    ```

    * 🔑 Then, we use the `useQuery` hook to make a query request using `QUERY_BOOKS`. We get a `loading` property and the `data` from the database.

    ```js
    const { loading, data } = useQuery(QUERY_BOOKS);
    ```

    * We get the `books` data from the query's response by using optional chaining.

    ```js
    const books = data?.books || [];
    ```

    * We then pass that data into `BookList` as props, and they are listed on the page.

    ```js
    <div>{loading ? <div>Loading...</div> : <BookList books={books} />}</div>
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What is the `loading` property of `useQuery` for?

    * 🙋 Since this is asynchronous, just like using `fetch()`, Apollo's `react-hooks` library provides a `loading` property to indicate that the request isn't done. When it's finished and we have data returned from the server, that information is stored in the destructured `data` property. Therefore we are able to conditionally render data based on whether or not there is data to display.

    * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 3, read the [Apollo Docs on Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 9. Instructor Demo: useEffect Fetch  (5 min)

* Navigate to `05-useEffect-fetch/Solved` in your command line and run `npm install` and `npm start` to demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 Before we search for anything, we see a GIF of a dog when the page is rendered.

    * 🔑 When we search for another GIF, like cat, the GIF is replaced with one of a cat.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We didn't use `useEffect` in this module, but if you remember, we learned it in Module 20 briefly and we will use it again in the next module. Also, this React Hook is used in the Challenge, so use this activity as an opportunity to practice and familiarize yourself with it so that you can succeed in the challenge.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 Although it wasn't covered in the async material, `useEffect` is used to make HTTP calls using `fetch`. You won't have to create any calls, but you will need to be able to read and understand what's going on.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 You will use `useEffect` to run the `handleSearchGiphy()` function so that it will display the GIF on the page after the page renders.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 10. Student Do: useEffect Fetch  (20 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `05-useEffect-fetch/README.md`.

```md
# useEffect fetch

In this activity, you will use the `useEffect` Hook to make HTTP calls using `fetch` and a search term to the Giphy API.

## Instructions

* Navigate to [Unsolved/](Unsolved/) in your command line and run `npm install`.

* Run `npm start` in your command line and notice how there is no GIF loaded on the page yet.

* Press `CTRL + C` to stop the server before moving on.

* Open [SearchGiphy.js](Unsolved/src/pages/SearchGiphy.js) and do the following:

  * Take a moment to see what is happening on the page and why no GIF is shown when the page is first loaded.

  * Import the `useEffect` Hook at the top of the page.

  * Use `useEffect` to run the `handleSearchGiphy()` function with a search term of your choice as the argument. This should display a GIF on the page when the page is loaded.

* To check if everything is working properly, navigate to [Unsolved/](Unsolved/) and run `npm start` in your command line.

  * Now you should see a GIF loaded on the page before you search for anything.

  * Go ahead and search for another GIF. That should replace the GIF on the page.

* Press `CTRL + C` to stop the server.

## Hint(s)

* You can refer to the React Docs on [Using the Effect Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html), especially the [last part](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html#tip-optimizing-performance-by-skipping-effects) about running an effect only once.
```


### 11. Instructor Review: useEffect Fetch  (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ `handleFormSubmit()`

    * ✔️ `handleSearchGiphy()`

    * ✔️ `fetchGiphy()`

    * ✔️ `useEffect()`

* Open `05-useEffect-fetch/Solved/src/pages/SearchGiphy.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

    * 🔑 Let's decipher what's doing on here. We have a form that will take in a search term upon submit. That is handled by the `handleFormSubmit()` function.

    ```js
    const handleFormSubmit = event => {
      event.preventDefault();
      if (!searchInput) {
        return false;
      }
      handleSearchGiphy(searchInput);
    };
    ```

    * 🔑 That search term `searchInput` is then handed off to the `handleSearchGiphy()` function.

    ```js
    const handleSearchGiphy = async query => {
      try {
        const response = await fetchGiphy(query);

        if (!response.ok) {
          throw new Error('something went wrong!');
        }

        const gif = await response.json();

        setSearchedGiphy(gif.data[0].images.fixed_height.url);
        setSearchInput('');
      } catch (err) {
        console.error(err);
      }
    };
    ```

    * 🔑 Notice how the search term `query` is used in the `fetchGiphy()` function for the `fetch` request.

    ```js
    export const fetchGiphy = (query) => {
      return fetch(
        `https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?q=${query}&api_key=HvaacROi9w5oQCDYHSIk42eiDSIXH3FN&limit=1`
      );
    };
    ```

    * 🔑 The response is then used to set the url of the `searchedGiphy` so that it shows up on the page. But the important part here is that until someone makes a search, nothing happens on the page. That's where `useEffect` comes in. After the page first renders, React will call `handleSearchGiphy()` with the search term you chose in your code. In our case, it was `dog`.

    ```js
    useEffect(() => {
      handleSearchGiphy('dog');
    }, []);
    ```

    * That's why you are able to see the GIF before you search for anything. By default, `useEffect` will run after every render. But we don't want that here. That's why we pass an empty array as a second argument. This tells React that your effect doesn't depend on any values from props or state, so it never needs to re-run.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What are the two common kinds of effects in React components?

    * 🙋 Those that don't required cleanup and those that do. Sometimes we want to run some code after React has updated the DOM, like network requests, manual DOM mutations, and logging. These don't require a cleanup. But some effects, like setting up a subscription to an external data source, does require cleanup so that we prevent a memory leak. Both of these are possible using the `useEffect` Hook.

    * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can read the [Complete Guide to useEffect](https://overreacted.io/a-complete-guide-to-useeffect/) by Dan Abramov himself and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 12. Recap & Promote Additional Resources (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What do you think you absolutely need to know to succeed at the challenge?

    * 🙋 Since the challenge is all about refactoring a RESTful API into a GraphQL API build with Apollo Server, you will definitely need to have a firm grasp of GraphQL.

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it is not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful.

    * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material prior to class as possible?

    * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

* Direct students to the additional resources available to them:

    * Reflection and Retrieval

    * Career Connection

    * Dessert Menu

### 13. Introduce Upcoming Challenge (5 min)

* Navigate to `01-Class-Content/22-State/02-Challenge/Main` from the command line and run `npm start`.

    * We see a website where you can view shopping items and add them to the cart. We can then checkout and pay for the items.

    * But the real challenge is refactoring this e-commerce platform to use Redux instead of Context API. You will need to read through the Redux documentation to find the information you need to implement Redux.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What are we learning?

    * 🙋 We are learning about complex state management. In the async material, we use Context API but in the challenge we will use Redux.

    * ☝️ How does this project build off or extend previously learned material?

    * 🙋 This project is the accumulation of everything we've learned so far! It utilizes the MERN stack and GraphQL.

    * ☝️ How does this project relate to your career goals?

    * 🙋 More than just the content of this project, but the research required to do the project will be very beneficial to your career. Web developers are frequently asked to dive into a new technology, sifting through documentation to find the right information that matches the specific problem they’re trying to solve. As you get ready to enter into your first development role, use this Challenge as a transition into a skill you’ll be using all the time over the course of your career.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.
