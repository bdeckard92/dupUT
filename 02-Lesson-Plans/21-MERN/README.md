# Module 21 Instructor Overview: MERN

## Overview

In this week's virtual classes, you'll go over mainly GraphQL, including using the Apollo Server and Apollo Boost to set up `typeDefs` and `resolvers`, making queries and mutations, and utilizing GraphQL Playground. You will also go over JSON Web Tokens and the `useEffect` Hook.

## Virtual Classes

[Recommended Class](./21.1-RECOMMENDED.md)

[Required Class](./21.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* This last phase of the boot camp is more about being employer-ready, improving the skills they have already learned, and making their web applications more performant and efficient. Basically, students will focus on "Life after Boot Camp". 

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have. 

* GraphQL Schema was covered in Lesson 1, JWT and GraphQL Mutations were covered in Lesson 2, and using Apollo Client was covered in Lesson 3.

* The `useEffect` Hook was not covered in the async material, however it is used in the Challenge. Use the class time to explain the activity and help students understand it so they can succeed in the Challenge.

## Career Connection

During each lesson that students work through, they will also view a Career Connection section that will tie together the academic content with Career Services, and how this material will be applicable to them in their future career.

Remind sudents that they should reach out to their Career Director and meet with them often throughout boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also sign up for [workshops](https://careerservicesonlineevents.splashthat.com/).
