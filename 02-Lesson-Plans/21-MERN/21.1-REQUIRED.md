# 21.1 Virtual Class: MERN

## Overview

In today's virtual class, students will use GraphQL. They'll use the Apollo Server to set up `typeDefs` and `resolvers`, make queries and use mutations, and use the GraphQL Playground.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Write queries using the GraphQL query language.

* Use mutations to modify server-side data.

## Instructor Notes

* It is highly recommended that prior to class, you go through each demo and activity so that you are familiar with the code and can anticipate issues that students new to GraphQL and the MERN framework may face.

* Today's activities rely on the GraphQL Playground. Students do not need to install a separate tool to access this technology. To use the GraphQL Playground, simply start the app using `npm install`, `npm run seed`, and `npm start`and point to `localhost:3001/graphql` in the browser.

* The GraphQL activities and instructor demonstrations require a minimum npm version of 7.0.0 or greater. Prior to class, please be sure to check your npm version and update if needed. Refer to the [NPM docs on updating to latest stable version](https://docs.npmjs.com/try-the-latest-stable-version-of-npm).

* For a refresher on how to use the GraphQL Playground, see the [Apollo docs on GraphQL Playground](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/testing/graphql-playground/).

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* Query arguments were covered in Lesson 1 and mutations were covered in Lesson 2.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Invite students to post questions in the Zoom chat so TAs and/or the instructor can address them at the end of class.

* Open the lesson's [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P8vSht6Vrp4Dljj3QEkvf8LPNSGAUAjUjnSFE9s5Rbk/edit?usp=sharing) and walk through the following slides on foundation setting:

  **Big Picture**: This is an opportunity to look at the big picture of where students are in the course. Take a moment to discuss a few real-world examples of why this week's topics are valuable.

  **Boot Camp Pointers**: Review some logistics that will help students stay on track. This is an opportunity to speak to what students might need at this particular point in the course.

  **This Week**: Review the key skills students will be learning this week.

  **This Week's Assignment**: Give a quick summary of this week's Challenge assignment and describe how the skills they learn throughout the week will be applied to it.

  **Career Connection**: Reinforce that students will use the skills they learn this week throughout their careers. It's important for them to know the "why" and "how" behind the "what." Give examples of how these skills are used on the job. If you feel comfortable, share examples of how you have used them in your professional career.

      * Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

        * ‚òù Last week, we talked briefly about learning React and the fact that many of the skills are transferrable to Vue or Angular. As such, you should apply to those jobs too! The same principle can be applied to the MERN stack. Can you think of some other common coding stacks?

        * üôã Each component of the so-called MERN stack can be switched out for different technologies that do similar things&mdash;such as using a different database like MySQL instead of MongoDB, or using Python and Flask instead of Node and Express. For each component, the skills are often transferrable.

      * Encourage students to consider applying widely to jobs even if they haven't learned all the skills in a job posting. When looking at a job posting, students can consider jobs that fall within the following parameters:

        * Require up to 2&ndash;3 years of experience (these positions will often hire entry-level with zero experience)

        * Require technologies that are similar to what we teach

        * Students are familiar with 40&ndash;50% of the technologies listed.

      * Remind students that a list of technologies on a job posting is merely a wish list&mdash;most companies know they won't get everything on it.

    **How to Succeed This Week**: Remind students that they might experience moments of frustration as they learn complex concepts and tools, and that these times are actually proven opportunities to deepen knowledge. Consider sharing something about your personal learning journey. This helps students recognize that everyone starts somewhere and that they are not alone.

    **Today's Objectives**: Outline the concepts that will be covered in today's lesson. Remind students that they can find the relevant activity files in the "Getting Ready for Class" page in their course content.

### 2. Instructor Do: Student Check-In (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How are you feeling about your progress so far?

  * üôã We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back at what we've accomplished and acknowledge that it is a lot! It‚Äôs also okay to feel overwhelmed&mdash;as long as you don‚Äôt give up.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with this topic?

  * üôã Let's do Fist to Five together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 3. Instructor Demo: Query Arguments (5 min)

* Navigate to `01-Query-Arguments/Solved` in your command line and run `npm install` and `npm run seed`.

* Remind students that today's activities will use the GraphQL playground in their browser.

* Run `npm run watch` and open `localhost:3001/graphql` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë We use the `classes` entry point to query all the `Class` objects using the field `name` and `_id`. This will give us a list of the the names and ids for all of the classes:

    ```gql
    query getAllClassIdNames {
      classes {
        name
        _id
      }
    }
    ```

  * We copy one of the ids returned so we can target a specific class:

    ```json
    "_id": "Copy_This_ID"
    ```

  * In the Query Variables pane, we give the value of the `id` variable the value of the id that we just copied, and we make sure that both `id` and the id that we just copied are surrounded by quotes. Adding this information will allow us to search for only the class with a specific `id`:

    ```json
    {"id" : "Add_Copied_ID_Here"}
    ```

  * Next, enter the provided query using a variable into the query editor. Since we assigned a value for the variable in the last step, this query will use that specific value to search:

    ```gql
    query class($id: ID!) {
      class(id: $id) {
        name
        professor {
          name
        }
      }
    }
    ```

  * We click the Play button. If our resolver is successful, both the specific class and professor's name will be fetched.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Where have we used this before?

  * üôã In Lesson 1, we learned about the GraphQL query language.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

    * üôã We will be using GraphQL for our Challenge, so we need to know how to query specific, targeted data.

    * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?

    * üôã When we add an argument to our query, the argument is then passed to our resolver function. The resolver can then use that information to make a more targeted search.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Query Arguments (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-Query-Arguments/README.md`, which are also shown here:

    ```md
    # üìñ Create a Class Resolver to Return Individual Classes

    Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

    * As a developer, I want to be able to query for individual classes.

    ## Acceptance Criteria

    * It's done when I have added a new resolver and the following GraphQL query returns a single class object:

      ```gql
      query class($id: ID!) {
        class(id: $id) {
          name
          professor {
            name
          }
        }
      }
      ```

    ## üìù Notes

    Refer to the documentation:

    [Apollo docs on GraphQL Playground](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/testing/graphql-playground/).

    [Apollo docs on handling arguments](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/data/resolvers/#handling-arguments)

    ---

    ## üí° Hints

    * What database query would retrieve a single object?

    ## üèÜ Bonus

    If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

    * How do you differentiate between required and optional arguments?

    Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
    ```

### 5. Instructor Review: Query Arguments (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `args`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `findById()`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `populate()`

* Open `01-Query-Arguments/Solved/schemas/resolvers.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * When we use a query with arguments, we create an object that holds the information we need to pass to our resolver.

  * üîë To have access to that object, our resolver function uses `args`.

  * Because `args` is the second of the positional parameters that the resolver can take, we list `args` second so it keeps its place:

    ```js
    class: async (parent, args) => {
    ```

  * üîë To return the data we need, we call the method `findById()` on the `Class` model we imported to read data from the MongoDB database. The `findById()` method is a built-in method on Mongoose models that allows us to easily search for a single method by `id`. Because we want the data in the `id`, we use `args.id`:

    ```js
    return await Class.findById(args.id);
    ```

  * üîë To access the related `Professor` object, we use `populate()`:

    ```js
    return await Class.findById(args.id).populate('professor');
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How can we get more specific results using arguments?

  * üôã Arguments allow us to query for more specific data by passing information from our query to our resolver. For example, we can search for a specific `id` by passing the information about that `id` to the resolver, which then can use that information to search the database for that specific object using that data.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why use variables in our queries?

  * üôã Variables allow us to make our queries more durable. For example, by using a variable when searching by id, we only had to change the value of the variable to search for another object. If we didn't have variables, we would have to write a whole new query.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to Lesson 1, read the [Apollo docs on handling arguments](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/data/resolvers/#handling-arguments), and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Mutations (5 min)

* Open `02-Mutations/Solved/schemas/typedefs.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * GraphQL does more than retrieve existing data. We can also use GraphQL to write data as well.

  * üîë The mutation type is similar to the query type. However, instead of providing an entry point to read an object or objects, the mutation type provides an entry point to write an object or objects.

  * üîë We create an entry point `addSchool` and set the object that it will write to to be a `School` object.

  * üîë We also pass in arguments that define the fields that will be written. This information will be passed to the resolver. Using this information, the resolver will then generate a response:

    ```js
    type Mutation {
      addSchool(name: String!, location: String!, studentCount: Int!): School
      updateClass(id: ID!, building: String!): Class
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Where have we used this before?

    * üôã We learned about GraphQL mutations in Lesson 2.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

    * üôã To build our challenge this week, we will need to know how to use GraphQL mutations and resolvers to write data to our database.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?

    * üôã A mutation is way to write data using GraphQL. We use the mutation type to define the entry point to the data to be written and a mutation resolver to provide the functionality to write the data to our database.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Mutations (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Mutations/README.md`, which are also shown here:

    ```md
    # üêõ Class Mutation Does Not Show that Object Was Updated

    Work with a partner to resolve the following issue:

    * As a developer, I want access to updated values so the front end can be updated accordingly.

    ## Expected Behavior

    Updating a class's building number should show the new value in the returned object.

    ## Actual Behavior

    The returned object still shows the old building number.

    ## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

    Follow these steps to reproduce the problem:

    1. In the command line, navigate to `02-Mutations/Unsolved`.

    2. Run `npm install`, `npm run seed`, and `npm start`.

    3. Open <localhost:3001/graphql> in the browser.

    4. Set the following variables in the Query Variables panel:

        ```json
        {
          "id": "<insert ID of a class here>",
          "building": "AA"
        }
        ```

    5. Run the following mutation:

        ```gql
        mutation updateClass($id: ID!, $building: String!) {
          updateClass(id: $id, building: $building) {
            name
            building
          }
        }
        ```

    6. Note that the `building` property in the returned data is not set to `"AA"`

    ---

    ## üí° Hints

    * How else could you verify if the data is being updated correctly?

    ## üèÜ Bonus

    If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

    * What tools will you need to run GraphQL queries in your own front end?

    Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
    ```

### 8. Instructor Review: Mutations (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `findOneAndUpdate()`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `{new: true}`

* Open `02-Mutations/Solved/schemas/resolvers.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * When your mutation is not working as expected, a great place to look is the resolver.

  * We have written a mutation to update the building for a specific class. However, it looks like when we run the mutation, the building is not being updated.

  * When your mutation is not working as expected, a great place to look is the resolver.

  * Because we are using Mongoose, we must import the model to write data to MongoDB. It looks like we have imported the `Class` model successfully.

    ```js
    const { School, Class, Professor } = require('../models');
    ```

  * We also need to make sure that our arguments are passed to the resolver. It looks like this is working too:

    ```js
    updateClass: async (parent, { id, building }) => {
    ```

  * üîë To write the data, we call the `.findOneAndUpdate()` method on the imported `Class` model and pass in the specific information needed to find the class by id and update the building:

    ```js
    return await Class.findOneAndUpdate(
      { _id: id },
      { building },
    }
    ```

  * üîë By default, the object returned will not be the one updated. To return the new object, we set `new` to be `true`. Adding this line will fix the bug in our resolver:

    ```js
    { new: true }
    ```

* Navigate to `02-Mutations/Solved` in your command line and run `npm install`, `npm run seed`, and `npm start`.

* Open `localhost:3001/graphql` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë We test if our resolver is now working by using an existing `Class` object id and adding the the provided test object to the Query Variable editor:

    ```json
      {
        "id": "<insert ID of a class here>",
        "building": "AA"
      }
    ```

  * üîë Next we run the provided mutation:

    ```gql
      mutation updateClass($id: ID!, $building: String!) {
        updateClass(id: $id, building: $building) {
          name
          building
        }
      }
    ```

  * The updated information should now be fetched.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How can we use mutations to create and update data?

  * üôã We use the mutation type to define the entry point for the object we want to write or update. We write a mutation resolver that performs the task of creating or updating the data.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * üôã We can refer to Lesson 2, read the [GraphQL docs on mutations](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#mutations), and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding.

### 9. Everyone Do: Git (30 min)

* Open the [GitHub docs Introduction to GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/introduction-to-github-actions) in your browser and explain the following:

  * **GitHub Actions** are automated tasks or workflows that run when certain events are triggered, like pull requests. At their core, they are a series of commands that allow us to automate things like deployment, testing, and linting.

  * Using this guide, you will create a GitHub Action that automatically runs linting checks on any pull request made to the `main` or `develop` branches. Actions like this can especially benefit collaborative efforts like group projects.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `Git-Guide/README.md`.

* While everyone is working on the activity, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

* Open your command line and demonstrate the following:

  * First we create a boilerplate React app:

    ```bash
    npx create-react-app gh-actions-demo
    ```

  * After a few minutes, the `create-react-app` utility will finish, and we move on to creating the GitHub Action.

  * üîë We set up the GitHub Action locally and then push it to GitHub. As a result, we still need to install dependencies locally to ensure that they are added to the `package.json` file. To do this, we change into the `gh-actions-demo` folder and run the following command:

    ```sh
    npm i eslint --save-dev
    ```

  * With `eslint` installed as a developer dependency, we add a new script to the `package.json` file that allows us to run linting checks with a single command:

    ```json
    "scripts": {
        "eslint": "eslint src"
    },
    ```

  * Next, we create a GitHub repository named `gh-actions-demo`, and we add the remote to the local repository:

    ```sh
    git remote add origin git@github.com:USERNAME/gh-actions-demo.git
    git branch -M main
    ```

  * We also add and commit all of the files and push to the remote repository:

    ```sh
    git add -A
    git commit -m "Adding existing files"
    git push -u origin main
    ```

  * We build the GitHub workflow by creating directories called `.github` and `.workflows`, with a `main.yml` file inside the `.workflows` directory.

  * Then we add the workflow to the `main.yml` file, telling GitHub which actions to execute when a specific trigger happens:

    ```yml
    #  Name of workflow
    name: Lint workflow
    # Trigger workflow on all pull requests
    on:
        pull_request:
            branches:
                - dev
                - main
    # Jobs to carry out
    jobs:
        test:
            # Operating system to run job on
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            # Steps in job
            steps:
                # Get code from repo
                - name: Checkout code
                  uses: actions/checkout@v1
                # Install NodeJS
                - name: Use Node.js 12.x
                  uses: actions/setup-node@v1
                  with:
                      node-version: 12.x
                # Build the app
                - name: üß∞ install deps
                  run: npm install
                - name: Run lint
                  run: npm run eslint
    ```

  * After that, we save the changes, commit all the files, and push to GitHub once again.

  * With the workflow in place in the repository, we can now create a new branch, make a pull request to `dev` or `main`, and witness the workflow in action!

* Answer any questions before proceeding.

### 10. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

    * üôã We covered the basics of GraphQL query arguments and mutations.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * üôã All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

    * üôã It's important both to be fully prepared to start the Challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

    * ‚òùÔ∏è Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

    * üôã GraphQL queries were covered in Lesson 1, and mutations in Lesson 2.

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Answer any questions before ending the class.
