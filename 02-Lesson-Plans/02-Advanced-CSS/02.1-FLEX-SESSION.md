# Module 02 Flex Session: Advanced CSS

## Overview

In today's flex session, we are going to focus on flexbox and media queries. We will do an activity on each to help solidify concepts covered early in this module.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Implement a flexbox layout for a responsive design

* Explain the use cases of media queries

* Implement media queries into their CSS

## Instructor Notes

* Student's will be early on in their work on the module, be prepared to answer questions related to the first few lessons of the module.

* While flexbox is simple at the surface, this is students first exposure to CSS, look over the activities ahead of time to be sure you are familiar with what they will encounter

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (5 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Direct students to post individual questions in the Zoom chat to be addressed by TAs and/or at the end of class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

  * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back and see what we accomplished, and acknowledge that it's a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic? 

  * 🙋 Let's do "fist to five" together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 2. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

@TODO CHECK WITH THE LCA, LCE & CS POC

### 3. Instructor Demo: Flexbox Cards (5 min)

* Use the prompts and talking points below to demonstrate the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ We will take the card container and make it a flexbox

  * ✔️We will take our individual cards and make them each a flexbox

  * ✔️ Rather than `position` we can use flexbox to create columns or rows.

* Open [1-Stu_Flexbox-Cards index.html](../../01-Class-Content/02-Advanced-CSS/01-Activities/1-Stu_Flexbox-Cards/Solved/index.html) in your browser and demonstrate the following:

	* 🔑 We have equally spaced cards in two columns.

	* 🔑 Each card is nicely formatted with the content centered at the bottom of each card.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 @TODO We used this to accomplish { X, Y, Z }, in { CORRESPONDING ASYNCHRONOUS LESSON PLAN }.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  * 🙋 This activity demonstrates and instills how we can use flexbox to create fluid and responsive layouts for our apps.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We need to use flexbox to create this layout. We will use a few different properties and rules to achieve this.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Flexbox Cards (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in [1-Stu-Flexbox-Cards](../../01-Class-Content/02-Advanced-CSS/01-Activities/1-Stu_Flexbox-Cards/README.md).

```md
# Flexbox Card Layout

In this activity you will take the provided code and make it resemble the mockup provided.

## Instructions

* Using the provided mockup, use flexbox to replicate the layout.

* **Hint** Each card is also its own flexbox!
```

### 5. Instructor Review: Flexbox Cards (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ Creating a flexbox to contain all of our cards

  * ✔️ Making individuals cards into a flexbox for positioning

  * ✔️ Using flexbox to position our elements into rows/columns

* Open [1-Stu-Flexbox-Cards](../../01-Class-Content/02-Advanced-CSS/01-Activities/1-Stu_Flexbox-Cards/Solved/assets/css/style.css) in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑To create a flexbox that contains all of our cards, we first add `display: flex` to our `.flex-container` selector.

  ```css
  .flex-container {
    display: flex;
  }
  ```

  * Next, we will add the `flex-wrap` rule so that cards will break onto the next line when we run out of space.

  ```css
  .flex-container {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 Lastly we will add `justify-content` and `width` rules to evenly place our unused space around our items. This will leave us with our final CSS for our flex container.

  ```css
  .flex-container {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    justify-content: space-between;
    width: 100%;
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 We also use flexbox to create columns instead of rows. To achieve this, we add the `display` and `flex-direction` rules to our `.flex-item` selector under all the included CSS rules..

  ```css
  .flex-item {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
  ```

  * To style our text area within our flex items, we use a few CSS rules we have seen before. this will include `margin-top`, `width`, `padding`, `text-align`, and some color styling. This will push the text area to the bottom and format it nicely within the cards.

  ```css
  .flex-item span {
    margin-top: auto;
    width: 100%;
    background-color: #A8ADBA;
    color: #393B4F;
    padding: 10px 5px;
    text-align: center;
  }
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ @TODO { DO WE END OUR REVIEWS WITH A QUESTION? }

  * 🙋 @TODO { YES, WE DO! }

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understanding this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [MDN documentation on Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: { ACTIVITY NAME } (5 min) 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to demonstrate the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ Media Queries allow us to style content based on the size of the screen

  * ✔️ We can specify any screen size breakpoint, but will use the standard sizes

  * ✔️ Allows for custom mobile responsiveness

* Open [2-Stu-Media-Queries](../../01-Class-Content/02-Advanced-CSS/01-Activities/2-Stu_Media-Queries/Solved/media-solved.html) in your browser and explain the following:

  * 🔑 When we resize the window, the content will change to better fit the new screen size.

  * 🔑 When the screen is at its smallest width wise, the content is still perfect formatted.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 @TODO We used this to accomplish { X, Y, Z }, in { CORRESPONDING ASYNCHRONOUS LESSON PLAN }.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  * 🙋 Mobile responsiveness is very important for any webpage, as users will access content from many different sizes of devices.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We would insert media queries into the CSS to specify how we would like the page to look at certain screen size break points.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 7. Student Do: { ACTIVITY NAME } (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `@TODO/folder/file`.

```md
    @TODO ADD INSTRUCTIONS; TABBED
```


### 8. Instructor Review: { ACTIVITY NAME } (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ @TODO { THIS }

  * ✔️ @TODO { THAT }

  * ✔️ @TODO { THE OTHER }

* Open `@TODO/folder/file` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * @TODO { WE DO THIS AND THE RESULT IS THAT }

  ```
  @TODO ADD CODE SNIPPET, TABBED
  ```

  * 🔑 @TODO DON'T FORGET TO USE THE KEY EMOJI ON KEY POINTS, BUT ONLY KEY POINTS, NOT _EVERY_ POINT

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ @TODO { DO WE END OUR REVIEWS WITH A QUESTION? }

  * 🙋 @TODO { YES, WE DO! }

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understanding this?

  * 🙋 @TODO We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [{ DOCS }]({ URL }), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

### 09. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

  * 🙋 @TODO { YES, WHAT? }

  * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

  * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful. 

  * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

  * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer. 

  * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

  * 🙋 @TODO { YES, WHERE? }

  * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

    * 🙋 @TODO { YES, WHAT? }
