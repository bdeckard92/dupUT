# Module 02 Flex Session: Advanced CSS

## Overview

In today's flex session, we are going to focus on flexbox and media queries. We will do an activity on each to help solidify concepts covered early in this module.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Implement a flexbox layout for a responsive design

* Explain the use cases of media queries

* Implement media queries into their CSS

## Instructor Notes

* Student's will be early on in their work on the module, be prepared to answer questions related to the first few lessons of the module.

* While flexbox is simple at the surface, this is students first exposure to CSS, look over the activities ahead of time to be sure you are familiar with what they will encounter

* The first two lessons of the module will have covered flexbox and media queries, this is your opportunity to help cement these topics with your students.

    * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back and see what we accomplished, and acknowledge that it's a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic? 

    * 🙋 Let's do "fist to five" together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).
