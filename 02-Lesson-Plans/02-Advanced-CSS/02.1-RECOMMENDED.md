# Module 02 Flex Session: Advanced CSS

## Overview

In today's flex session, we are going to focus on flexbox and media queries. We will do an activity on each to help solidify concepts covered early in this module.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Implement a flexbox layout for a responsive design

* Explain the use cases of media queries

* Implement media queries into their CSS

## Instructor Notes

* Student's will be early on in their work on the module, be prepared to answer questions related to the first few lessons of the module.

* While flexbox is simple at the surface, this is students first exposure to CSS, look over the activities ahead of time to be sure you are familiar with what they will encounter

* In the async material, flexbox is first introduced in Lesson 2 where students are tasked with replacing all of the floats on the Run Buddy webpage.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (5 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Direct students to post individual questions in the Zoom chat to be addressed by TAs and/or at the end of class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

  * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back and see what we accomplished, and acknowledge that it's a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic? 

  * 🙋 Let's do "fist to five" together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 2. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

@TODO CHECK WITH THE LCA, LCE & CS POC

https://trilogyed.atlassian.net/browse/FSFO-454

### 3. Instructor Demo: Flexbox Cards (5 min)

* Open [1-Stu_Flexbox-Cards/Solved/index.html](../../01-Class-Content/02-Advanced-CSS/01-Activities/1-Stu_Flexbox-Cards/Solved/index.html) in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We have equally spaced cards in two columns.

  * 🔑 Each card is nicely formatted with the content centered at the bottom of each card.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We used this to create side-by-side trainer cards in Lesson 2.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  * 🙋 This activity demonstrates and instills how we can use flexbox to create fluid and responsive layouts for our apps.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We need to use flexbox to create this layout. We will use a few different properties and rules to achieve this.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Flexbox Cards (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in [1-Stu_Flexbox-Cards/README.md](../../01-Class-Content/02-Advanced-CSS/01-Activities/1-Stu_Flexbox-Cards/README.md).

```md
# Flexbox Card Layout

In this activity you will take the provided code and make it resemble the mockup provided.

## Instructions

* Using the provided mockup, use flexbox to replicate the layout.

* **Hint** Each card is also its own flexbox!
```

### 5. Instructor Review: Flexbox Cards (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ Using flex value with display property

  * ✔️ Make each card a flexbox for positioning

  * ✔️ Using column value with flex-direction property

* Open [1-Stu_Flexbox-Cards/Solved/assets/css/style.css](../../01-Class-Content/02-Advanced-CSS/01-Activities/1-Stu_Flexbox-Cards/Solved/assets/css/style.css) in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑To create a flexbox that contains all of our cards, we first add `display: flex` to our `.flex-container` selector.

  ```css
  .flex-container {
    display: flex;
  }
  ```

  * Next, we will add the `flex-wrap` rule so that cards will break onto the next line when we run out of space.

  ```css
  .flex-container {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 Lastly we will add `justify-content` and `width` rules to evenly place our unused space around our items. This will leave us with our final CSS for our flex container.

  ```css
  .flex-container {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    justify-content: space-between;
    width: 100%;
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 We also use flexbox to create columns instead of rows. To achieve this, we add the `display` and `flex-direction` rules to our `.flex-item` selector under all the included CSS rules..

  ```css
  .flex-item {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
  ```

  * To style our text area within our flex items, we use a few CSS rules we have seen before. this will include `margin-top`, `width`, `padding`, `text-align`, and some color styling. This will push the text area to the bottom and format it nicely within the cards.

  ```css
  .flex-item span {
    margin-top: auto;
    width: 100%;
    background-color: #A8ADBA;
    color: #393B4F;
    padding: 10px 5px;
    text-align: center;
  }
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How is flexbox beneficial to us?

  * 🙋 It allows us to easily and quickly define positioning of flex items within flex containers. We can also dictate if they should be ordered by rows or columns.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understanding this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [MDN documentation on Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Media Queries (5 min)

* Open [2-Stu_Media-Queries/Solved/index.html](../../01-Class-Content/02-Advanced-CSS/01-Activities/2-Stu_Media-Queries/Solved/index.html) in your browser and explain the following:

  * 🔑 When we resize the window, the content will change to better fit the new screen size.

  * 🔑 When the screen is at its smallest width wise, the content is still perfect formatted.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We used this to shift the content of the Run Buddy header and hero (among other sections) in Lesson 3.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  * 🙋 Mobile responsiveness is very important for any webpage, as users will access content from many devices of differing sizes.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We would insert media queries into the CSS to specify how we would like the page to look at certain screen size break points.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Media Queries (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in [02-Stu-Media-Queries](../../01-Class-Content/02-Advanced-CSS/01-Activities/2-Stu_Media-Queries/README.md).

```md
### File

* in this activity you will incorporate media queries to add mobile responsiveness to the provided HTML and CSS

### Instructions

* Add more styling to the CSS file such that the `@media screen` code creates padding and margins for the two boxes when the page is below 768px.

* The `meta viewport tag` is required for the Chrome Responsive Tools to actually function, so its important we always add it.

* **NOTE:** This isn't easy. Just give it your best shot. Even if you don't get the exact solution, but are able to better understand how media queries work, that's a solid takeaway.

```

### 8. Instructor Review: Media Queries (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ Use `px` value with `max-width`

  * ✔️ Multiple breakpoints accommodates all device sizes

  * ✔️ 5 break points should give good device coverage

* Open [2-Stu_Media-Queries/Solved/assets/css/style.css](../../01-Class-Content/02-Advanced-CSS/01-Activities/2-Stu_Media-Queries/Solved/assets/css/style.css) in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 The first breakpoint we will use is at `1024px`. We set our media query by stating the screen and max width

  ```css
  @media screen and (max-width: 1024px) {

  }
  ```

  * 🔑 Within our media query, we will designate styles just as we normally would. We will just create specific rules for our new screen size. Like adding a `width: 100%` rule, to make sure the width always takes up the screen size, and `padding` to make it look good.

  ```css
  @media screen and (max-width: 1024px) {
    body {
      background-color: #333;
    }

    .wrapper {
      /* Box-model */
      width: 100%;
      padding: 20px;
    }

    #main-content,
    #sidebar {
      width: 100%;
    }

    #sidebar {
      margin-top: 40px;
    }
  }
  ```

  * We will go ahead and do the same for screen sizes of `768px`, `600px`, `480px`, and `300px` using the same styles.

  ```css
  @media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
    body {
      background-color: #333;
    }

    .wrapper {
      /* Box-model */
      width: 100%;
      padding: 20px;
    }

    #main-content,
    #sidebar {
      width: 100%;
    }

    #sidebar {
      margin-top: 40px;
    }
  }
  /* Width at 600px and below */
  @media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
    body {
      background-color: #333;
    }

    .wrapper {
      /* Box-model */
      width: 100%;
      padding: 20px;
    }

    #main-content,
    #sidebar {
      width: 100%;
    }

    #sidebar {
      margin-top: 40px;
    }
  }
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why do we need to account for all these screen sizes?

  * 🙋 Making sure we create styles for as many screen sizes as possible will make sure all users have a good experience.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understanding this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [MDN documentation on Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 09. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

  * 🙋 Today we learned how to utilize flexbox for slick and responsive layouts, and media queries to assure the page looks the way we want, no matter the screen size.

  * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

  * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful. 

  * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

  * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

  * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

  * 🙋 Lesson 2 for flexbox, Lesson 3 for media queries.

  * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

    * 🙋 CSS Grid, Pseudo-selectors, and CSS Variables are going to really fill out our CSS skill set!

### 10. Office Hours (30 min)

* Announce office hours and invite students to stay on the Zoom and start the challenge while they have live support from instructional staff.
