# Module 02 Virtual Class (Recommended): Advanced CSS

## Overview

In today's recommended virtual class, students will focus on flexbox and media queries. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Implement a flexbox layout for a responsive design

* Explain the use cases of media queries

* Implement media queries into their CSS

## Instructor Notes

* Students will be early on in their work on the module. Be prepared to answer questions related to the first few lessons of the module.

* While flexbox is simple at the surface, this is students' first exposure to CSS. Look over the activities ahead of time to be sure you are familiar with what they will encounter.

* In the async material, flexbox is first introduced in Lesson 2 where students are tasked with replacing all of the floats on the Run Buddy webpage. Media queries are introduced in Lesson 3 when students update Run Buddy to accommodate different screen sizes.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (5 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Direct students to post individual questions in the Zoom chat to be addressed by TAs and/or at the end of class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

  * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back and see what we accomplished, and acknowledge that it's a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic? 

  * 🙋 Let's do "fist to five" together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 2. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* Ask the class the following question (☝️) and call on students for the answer (🙋):

  * ☝ Why do we need a portfolio? 
  
  * 🙋 We need a portfolio to showcase our work to prospective clients and employers. 

  * ☝ What can we do to make our portfolio more appealing to employers?
  
  * 🙋 Make it unique by adding custom styling and our personal touch.

  * ☝ Do you need to be a designer to make an appealing portfolio?

  * 🙋 No! Unless you are applying for a design role, what is most important is showcasing your work as a developer. 

  * ☝ What are some resources for getting inspiration when building our portfolios?

  * 🙋 There are a lot of resources available for inspiration, such as [Dribbble.com](https://dribbble.com/) and [awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/).

  * ☝ Does anyone want to share an example of a portfolio they think is appealing? If so, why do you find it appealing? 

* Use student responses to facilitate discussion on creating an appealing portfolio. If students don't share examples, use one of the resources above.

### 3. Instructor Demo: Flexbox Cards (5 min)

* Open `01-Flexbox-Cards/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We have equally spaced cards in two columns.

  * 🔑 Each card is nicely formatted with the content centered at the bottom of each card.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We used this to create side-by-side trainer cards in Lesson 2.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  * 🙋 This activity demonstrates and instills how we can use flexbox to create fluid and responsive layouts for our apps.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We need to use flexbox to create this layout. We will use a few different properties and rules to achieve this.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Flexbox Cards (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-Flexbox-Cards/README.md`.

```md
# Flexbox Card Layout

In this activity, you will use flexbox to organize the cards into two columns and center the contents of the card.

## Instructions

* Open `index.html` in your browser and look at the current layout.

* Open the `style.css` file in your IDE and examine the code. Read the provided comments to understand what the CSS is doing.

  * Using flexbox, position the cards and the contents of the cards to resemble the layout in the following image:

  ![The mockup image displays all of the items on the page laid out in a grid with their titles overlaying the image](./Images/100-mockup.png)

  * Look for the `TODO`s in the comments!

## Hints

  * Each card is also its own flexbox!
```

### 5. Instructor Review: Flexbox Cards (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ Using flex value with display property

  * ✔️ Make each card a flexbox for positioning

  * ✔️ Using column value with flex-direction property

* Open `01-Flexbox-Cards/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 To create a flexbox that contains all of our cards, we first add `display: flex` to our `.flex-container` selector.

  ```css
  .flex-container {
    display: flex;
  }
  ```

  * Next, we will add the `flex-wrap` rule so that cards will break onto the next line when we run out of space.

  ```css
  .flex-container {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 Lastly we will add `justify-content` and `width` rules to evenly place our unused space around our items. 

  ```css
  .flex-container {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    justify-content: space-between;
    width: 100%;
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 We also use flexbox to create columns instead of rows. To achieve this, we add the `display` and `flex-direction` rules to our `.flex-item` selector under the CSS rules that are already provided.

  ```css
  .flex-item {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
  ```

  * To style our text area within our flex items, we use a few CSS rules we have seen before. this will include `margin-top`, `width`, `padding`, `text-align`, and some color styling. This will push the text area to the bottom and format it nicely within the cards.

  ```css
  .flex-item span {
    margin-top: auto;
    width: 100%;
    background-color: #A8ADBA;
    color: #393B4F;
    padding: 10px 5px;
    text-align: center;
  }
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How is flexbox beneficial to us?

  * 🙋 It allows us to easily and quickly define positioning of flex items within flex containers. We can also dictate if they should be ordered by rows or columns.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to the lessons, read the [MDN Web Docs on Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Media Queries (5 min)

* Open `02-Media-Queries/Solved/index.html` in your browser and open Chrome DevTools to demonstrate simulating a mobile viewport:

  * In order to access the Chrome DevTools, we can press Cmd+Opt+I on Mac or Ctrl+Shift+I on Windows.

  * We can enable the device emulator by clicking the "Toggle device toolbar" icon in the top-left.

  * We can select Responsive and drag the edges of the screen to any size we want. Or we can choose from the drop-down list of popular devices.
  
  * 🔑 When we resize the window, the content will change to better fit the new screen size.

  * 🔑 When the screen is at its smallest width, the content is still well-formatted.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We used this to shift the content of the Run Buddy header and hero (among other sections) in Lesson 3.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  * 🙋 Mobile responsiveness is very important for any webpage, as users will access content from many devices of differing sizes.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We would insert media queries into the CSS to specify how we would like the page to look at certain screen size break points.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Media Queries (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Media-Queries/README.md`.

```md
# Media Queries

In this activity, you will use media queries to ensure the components will stack on top of each other when the screen size gets smaller.

## Instructions

* Open `index.html` in your browser and open Chrome DevTools to change the screen size. Notice what happens to the components when the screen size gets smaller.

* Open the `style.css` file in your IDE and examine the code. 

* At the bottom of the stylesheet, add media queries for the various screen sizes to change the styles as outlined below:

  * Change the background color to `#333`.

  * Set the width of the `<div>` and the two `<section>`s so that the components will always take up the screen size.

  * Add some padding to the `<div>`

  * Add a margin to the `sidebar` to give it some space from the `main-content` box.
```

### 8. Instructor Review: Media Queries (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ `max-width`

  * ✔️ `.wrapper`

  * ✔️ `#main-content`

  * ✔️ `#sidebar`

* Open `02-Media-Queries/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 The first breakpoint we will use is at `1024px`. We set our media query by stating the screen and max width

  ```css
  @media screen and (max-width: 1024px) {

  }
  ```

  * Within our media query, we will designate the styles for the various components. They will be the same for each breakpoint.
  
  * For the `body`, we will change the `background-color` to be `#333`.

  ```css
  body {
    background-color: #333;
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 For the `<div class="wrapper">`, we will set the `width` to 100% and give it a `padding` of 20px.

  ```css
  .wrapper {
    width: 100%;
    padding: 20px;
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 For the two `<sections>`s, we will also set the `width` to 100%.

  ```css
  #main-content,
  #sidebar {
    width: 100%;
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 And finally, we will give the `<section id="sidebar">` a `margin-top` of 40px so that it will stay separated from the other `<section>`

  ```css
  #sidebar {
    margin-top: 40px;
  }
  ```

  * We will go ahead and do the same for screen sizes of `768px`, `600px`, `480px`, and `300px` using the same styles.

  ```css
  @media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
    body {
      background-color: #333;
    }

    .wrapper {
      /* Box-model */
      width: 100%;
      padding: 20px;
    }

    #main-content,
    #sidebar {
      width: 100%;
    }

    #sidebar {
      margin-top: 40px;
    }
  }
  /* Width at 600px and below */
  @media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
    body {
      background-color: #333;
    }

    .wrapper {
      /* Box-model */
      width: 100%;
      padding: 20px;
    }

    #main-content,
    #sidebar {
      width: 100%;
    }

    #sidebar {
      margin-top: 40px;
    }
  }
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why do we need to account for all these screen sizes?

  * 🙋 Making sure we create styles for as many screen sizes as possible will make sure all users have a good experience.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to the lessons, read the [MDN Web Docs on Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 09. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

  * 🙋 Today we learned how to utilize flexbox for slick and responsive layouts, and media queries to assure the page looks the way we want, no matter the screen size.

  * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

  * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful.
