# Module 02 Virtual Class: Advanced CSS

## Overview

In today's virtual class, students will focus on flexbox and media queries.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Implement a flexbox layout for a responsive design

* Explain the use cases of media queries

* Implement media queries into their CSS

## Instructor Notes

* At the time of this class, students will be early on in their work on the module. Be prepared to answer questions about the first few lessons.

* While flexbox is simple at the surface, students are still new to CSS. Look over the activities ahead of time to be sure you are familiar with what they will encounter.

* In the async material, flexbox is first introduced in Lesson 2 where students are tasked with replacing all of the floats on the Run Buddy webpage. Media queries are introduced in Lesson 3 when students update Run Buddy to accommodate different screen sizes.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Invite students to post questions in the Zoom chat so TAs and/or the instructor can address them at the end of class.

* Open the lesson [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1I9QBdmwg3TVKVPPp6KjbxQXIfN52XfuQXO4lJ-hbEtc/edit?usp=sharing) and walk through the following slides on foundation setting:

  **Big Picture**: This is an opportunity to look at the big picture of where students are in the course. Take a moment to discuss a few real-world examples of why this week's topics are valuable.

  **Boot Camp Pointers**: Review some logistics that will help students stay on track. This is an opportunity to speak to what students might need at this particular point in the course.

  **This Week**: Review the key skills students will be learning this week.

  **This Week's Assignment**: Give a quick summary of this week's Challenge assignment and describe how the skills they learn throughout the week will be applied to it.

  **Career Connection**: Reinforce that students will use the skills they learn this week throughout their careers. It's important for them to know the "why" and "how" behind the "what." Give examples of how these skills are used on the job. If you feel comfortable, share examples of how you have used them in your professional career. The first few questions are intended to get students talking, so make sure to manage your time effectively. Only plan to spend about 20&ndash;30 seconds on the first few questions so that you have more time to discuss how to build a portfolio.

  * Ask the class the following question (☝️) and call on students for the answer (🙋):

    * ☝ Why do we need a portfolio?

    * 🙋 We need a portfolio to showcase our work to prospective clients and employers.

    * ☝ What can we do to make our portfolio more appealing to employers?

    * 🙋 Make it unique by adding custom styling and our personal touch.

    * ☝ Do you need to be a designer to make an appealing portfolio?

    * 🙋 No! Unless you are applying for a design role, what is most important is showcasing your work as a developer.

    * ☝ What are some resources for getting inspiration when building our portfolios?

    * 🙋 There are many resources available for inspiration, such as [Dribbble.com](https://dribbble.com/) and [awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/).

    * ☝ Does anyone want to share an example of a portfolio they think is appealing? If so, why do you find it appealing?

  * Use student responses to facilitate discussion on creating an appealing portfolio. If students don't share examples, use one of the resources above.

  **How to Succeed This Week**: Remind students that they might experience moments of frustration as they learn complex concepts and tools, and that these times are actually proven opportunities to deepen knowledge. Consider sharing something about your personal learning journey. This helps students recognize that everyone starts somewhere, that being a developer means constantly learning new technologies, and that they are not alone.

  **Today's Objectives**: Outline the concepts that will be covered in today's lesson. Remind students that they can find the relevant activity files in the "Getting Ready for Class" page in their course content.

### 2. Instructor Do: Student Check-In (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

  * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back and see what we accomplished, and acknowledge that it's a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic?

  * 🙋 Let's do a Fist to Five together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 3. Instructor Demo: Flexbox Cards (5 min)

* Open `01-Flexbox-Cards/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We have equally spaced cards in two columns.

  * 🔑 Each card is nicely formatted with the content centered at the bottom of each card.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We used this to create side-by-side trainer cards in Lesson 2.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

  * 🙋 This activity demonstrates and instills how we can use flexbox to create fluid and responsive layouts for our apps.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We need to use flexbox to create this layout. We will use a few different properties and rules to achieve this.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Flexbox Cards (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-Flexbox-Cards/README.md`, which are also shown here:

   ```md
   # Flexbox Card Layout

   In this activity, you will use flexbox to organize the cards into two columns and center the contents of the card.

   ## Instructions

   * Open `index.html` in your browser and look at the current layout.

   * Open the `style.css` file in your IDE and examine the code. Read the provided comments to understand what the CSS is doing.

     * Using flexbox, position the cards and the contents of the cards to resemble the layout in the following image:

     ![The mockup image displays all of the items on the page laid out in a grid with their titles overlaying the image](./Images/100-mockup.png)

     * Look for the `TODO`s in the comments!

   ## Hints

     * Each card is also its own flexbox!
   ```

### 5. Instructor Review: Flexbox Cards (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points (:key:) below to review the following key points (✔️):

  * ✔️ Using flex value with display property

  * ✔️ Make each card a flexbox for positioning

  * ✔️ Using column value with flex-direction property

* Open `01-Flexbox-Cards/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 To create a flexbox that contains all of our cards, we first add `display: flex` to our `.flex-container` selector.

     ```css
     .flex-container {
       display: flex;
     }
     ```

  * Next, we will add the `flex-wrap` rule so that cards will break onto the next line when we run out of space.

     ```css
     .flex-container {
       display: flex;
       flex-wrap: wrap;
     }
     ```

  * 🔑 Lastly we will add `justify-content` and `width` rules to evenly place our unused space around our items.

     ```css
     .flex-container {
       display: flex;
       flex-wrap: wrap;
       justify-content: space-between;
       width: 100%;
     }
     ```

  * 🔑 We also use flexbox to create columns instead of rows. To achieve this, we add the `display` and `flex-direction` rules to our `.flex-item` selector under the CSS rules that are already provided.

     ```css
     .flex-item {
       display: flex;
       flex-direction: column;
     ```

  * To style our text area within our flex items, we use a few CSS rules we have seen before. this will include `margin-top`, `width`, `padding`, `text-align`, and some color styling. This will push the text area to the bottom and format it nicely within the cards.

     ```css
     .flex-item span {
       margin-top: auto;
       width: 100%;
       background-color: #A8ADBA;
       color: #393B4F;
       padding: 10px 5px;
       text-align: center;
     }
     ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How is flexbox beneficial to us?

  * 🙋 It allows us to easily and quickly define positioning of flex items within flex containers. We can also dictate if they should be ordered by rows or columns.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to the lessons, read the [MDN Web Docs on Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox), and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Media Queries (5 min)

* Open `02-Media-Queries/Solved/index.html` in your browser and open Chrome DevTools to demonstrate simulating a mobile viewport:

  * In order to access the Chrome DevTools, we can press Cmd+Opt+I on macOS or Ctrl+Shift+I on Windows.

  * We can enable the device emulator by clicking the "Toggle device toolbar" icon in the top-left corner.

  * We can select Responsive and drag the edges of the screen to any size we want. Or we can choose from the drop-down list of popular devices.

  * 🔑 When we resize the window, the content will change to better fit the new screen size.

  * 🔑 When the screen is at its smallest width, the content is still well-formatted.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We used this to shift the content of the Run Buddy header and hero (and other sections) in Lesson 3.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

  * 🙋 Mobile responsiveness is very important for any webpage, as users will access content from devices that vary in size.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We would insert media queries into the CSS to specify how we want the page to look at certain screen size break points.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Media Queries (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Media-Queries/README.md`, which are also shown here:

   ```md
   # Media Queries

   In this activity, you will use media queries to ensure the components will stack on top of each other when the screen size gets smaller.

   ## Instructions

   * Open `index.html` in your browser and open Chrome DevTools to change the screen size. Notice what happens to the components when the screen size gets smaller.

   * Open the `style.css` file in your IDE and examine the code.

   * At the bottom of the stylesheet, add media queries for the various screen sizes to change the styles as outlined below:

     * Change the background color to `#333`.

     * Set the width of the `<div>` and the two `<section>`s so that the components will always take up the screen size.

     * Add some padding to the `<div>`

     * Add a margin to the `sidebar` to give it some space from the `main-content` box.
   ```

### 8. Instructor Review: Media Queries (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points (:key:) below to review the following key points (✔️):

  * ✔️ `max-width`

  * ✔️ `.wrapper`

  * ✔️ `#main-content`

  * ✔️ `#sidebar`

* Open `02-Media-Queries/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 The first breakpoint we will use is at `1024px`. We set our media query by stating the screen and max width:

     ```css
     @media screen and (max-width: 1024px) {

     }
     ```

  * Within our media query, we will designate the styles for the various components. They will be the same for each breakpoint.

  * For the `body`, we will change the `background-color` to be `#333`:

     ```css
     body {
       background-color: #333;
     }
     ```

  * 🔑 For the `<div class="wrapper">`, we will set the `width` to 100% and give it a `padding` of 20px:

     ```css
     .wrapper {
       width: 100%;
       padding: 20px;
     }
     ```

  * 🔑 For the two `<sections>`s, we will also set the `width` to 100%:

     ```css
     #main-content,
     #sidebar {
       width: 100%;
     }
     ```

  * 🔑 And finally, we will give the `<section id="sidebar">` a `margin-top` of 40px so that it will stay separated from the other `<section>`:

     ```css
     #sidebar {
       margin-top: 40px;
     }
     ```

  * We will go ahead and do the same for screen sizes of `768px`, `600px`, `480px`, and `300px` using the same styles:

     ```css
     @media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
       body {
         background-color: #333;
       }

       .wrapper {
         /* Box-model */
         width: 100%;
         padding: 20px;
       }

       #main-content,
       #sidebar {
         width: 100%;
       }

       #sidebar {
         margin-top: 40px;
       }
     }
     /* Width at 600px and below */
     @media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
       body {
         background-color: #333;
       }

       .wrapper {
         /* Box-model */
         width: 100%;
         padding: 20px;
       }

       #main-content,
       #sidebar {
         width: 100%;
       }

       #sidebar {
         margin-top: 40px;
       }
     }
     ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why do we need to account for all of these screen sizes?

  * 🙋 Users access websites from many types of devices with various screen sizes. Creating styles for as many screen sizes as possible will make sure all users have a good experience.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to the lessons, read the [MDN Web Docs on Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries), and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Everyone Do: Git (30 min)

* Open the [Git docs on git pull](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-pull) in your browser and explain the following:

  * Whenever we want to retrieve updated code from the repository in GitHub, we use `git pull` to integrate it into the local codebase.

  * Sometimes, however, the changes we have made and tracked with Git locally and the changed code we're pulling from GitHub don't match up. Because of this, Git doesn't know how to resolve the issue, and it creates what's known as a **merge conflict**.

  * This activity will serve as a guide to help understand merge conflicts and how to fix them.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `27-Evr-Git-Pull-Conflict`.

* While everyone is working on the activity, be sure to remind students and instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

* Near the end of this activity, make sure students know the following key point:

  * 🔑 Merge conflicts will happen, especially in a collaborative setting, so there's no need to panic when they arise.

* Answer any questions before proceeding.

### 10. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

  * 🙋 Today, we learned how to use flexbox to create responsive layouts, and media queries to assure the page looks the way we want no matter the screen size.

  * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

  * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful.

  * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

  * 🙋 It's important for two reasons: to be fully prepared to start the Challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

  * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

  * 🙋 Lesson 2 for flexbox, Lesson 3 for media queries.

  * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

  * 🙋 Pseudo-selectors and CSS Variables are going to really fill out our CSS skill set!

* Answer any questions before ending the class.
