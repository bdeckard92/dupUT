# Module 02 Virtual Class: Advanced CSS

## Overview

In today's virtual class, students will focus on wireframing and flexbox.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Create and explain the purpose of a wireframe.

* Implement a flexbox layout for a responsive web design.

* Use flexbox justification and alignment properties for spacing.

## Instructor Notes

* Be ready to use Chrome DevTools and the device emulator to quickly demonstrate various CSS concepts on different screen sizes.

* Make sure to remind students that CSS is a broad language with many tricks to learn. They shouldn't expect to learn it all in one week. In fact, they will continue to build their CSS knowledge throughout the entire course.

* While flexbox is simple at the surface, this is students' first exposure to CSS. Look over the activities ahead of time to be sure you are familiar with what they will encounter.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* In the async material, flexbox and wireframing is first introduced in Lesson 2 where students are tasked with replacing all of the floats on the Run Buddy webpage.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Invite students to post questions in the Zoom chat so TAs and/or the instructor can address them at the end of class.

* Open the lesson [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1I9QBdmwg3TVKVPPp6KjbxQXIfN52XfuQXO4lJ-hbEtc/edit?usp=sharing) and walk through the following slides on foundation setting:

  **Big Picture**: This is an opportunity to look at the big picture of where students are in the course. Take a moment to discuss a few real-world examples of why this week's topics are valuable.

  **Boot Camp Pointers**: Review some logistics that will help students stay on track. This is an opportunity to speak to what students might need at this particular point in the course.

  **This Week**: Review the key skills students will be learning this week.

  **This Week's Assignment**: Give a quick summary of this week's Challenge assignment and describe how the skills they learn throughout the week will be applied to it.

  **Career Connection**: Reinforce that students will use the skills they learn this week throughout their careers. It's important for them to know the "why" and "how" behind the "what." Give examples of how these skills are used on the job. If you feel comfortable, share examples of how you have used them in your professional career. The first few questions are intended to get students talking, so make sure to manage your time effectively. Only plan to spend about 20&ndash;30 seconds on the first few questions so that you have more time to discuss how to build a portfolio.

  * Ask the class the following question (☝️) and call on students for the answer (🙋):

    * ☝ Why do we need a portfolio?

    * 🙋 We need a portfolio to showcase our work to prospective clients and employers.

    * ☝ What can we do to make our portfolio more appealing to employers?

    * 🙋 Make it unique by adding custom styling and our personal touch.

    * ☝ Do you need to be a designer to make an appealing portfolio?

    * 🙋 No! Unless you are applying for a design role, what is most important is showcasing your work as a developer.

    * ☝ What are some resources for getting inspiration when building our portfolios?

    * 🙋 There are many resources available for inspiration, such as [Dribbble.com](https://dribbble.com/) and [awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/).

    * ☝ Does anyone want to share an example of a portfolio they think is appealing? If so, why do you find it appealing?

  * Use student responses to facilitate discussion on creating an appealing portfolio. If students don't share examples, use one of the resources above.

  **How to Succeed This Week**: Remind students that they might experience moments of frustration as they learn complex concepts and tools, and that these times are actually proven opportunities to deepen knowledge. Consider sharing something about your personal learning journey. This helps students recognize that everyone starts somewhere, that being a developer means constantly learning new technologies, and that they are not alone.

  **Today's Objectives**: Outline the concepts that will be covered in today's lesson. Remind students that they can find the relevant activity files in the "Getting Ready for Class" page in their course content.

### 2. Instructor Do: Student Check-In (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

  * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back and see what we accomplished, and acknowledge that it's a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic?

  * 🙋 Let's do a Fist to Five together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 3. Instructor Demo: Wireframing (5 min)

* Open `01-Wireframing/Unsolved/assets/Images/02-unfinished-wireframe.png` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * This image shows the start of a wireframe for a project, with the rows and columns highlighted.

  * 🔑 When creating a wireframe, we want a way to visually represent our page layout. We can to start thinking about how you want to lay out the elements on your page.

  * 🔑 These rows and columns directly translate to containers that we can use when we begin coding when the time comes.

* Open `01-Wireframing/Images/01-wireframe-form-completed.png` in your browser and explain the following:

  * Here is the final product that we will create today, which you can keep in mind as you work on your wireframe.

  * 🔑 Our goal to is replicate the final design as closely as possible so that we have a better idea of what needs to be replicated in code.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What is one reason why we might want to create a wireframe?

  * 🙋 A wireframe allows designers to and developers to be on the same page when it comes to executing on a vision. It also reduces ambiguity or confusion on where elements should be placed on the page.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  * 🙋 This activity demonstrates the importance of wireframes in understand a client's vision and being able to deliver on that vision effectively.

  * ☝️ How could we build this?

  * 🙋 We could build a wireframe by using something like Google Slides or another wireframing tool like [draw.io](https://draw.io)

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Wireframing (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-Wireframing/README.md`.

  ```md
  # 🏗️ Create a Wireframe

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to be able to see how my elements will be grouped together so that I can better design my website.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It is done when I have created a wireframe using Google Slides that has the correct elements grouped together based on the web app's columns and rows.

  * It is done when I have completed the wireframe of the CSS snippet cheat sheet mini-project.

  ## Assets

  The following image shows a wireframe that depicts the web application's appearance and functionality:

  ![Example of a finished wireframe for a form.](./Images/01-wireframe-form-completed.png)

  ### Instructions

  1. Navigate to [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/u/0/create?usp=slides_home&ths=true) and create a new presentation using the blank template.

  2. Using the tools highlighted in the following image, create a wireframe that includes all the elements that you need for the project:

  ![Google Slide tools outlined in red.](./Images/02-google-slides-tool-highlight.png)

  ---

  ## 💡 Hints

  * How do elements interact with each other when using flexbox?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner:

  * How might our wireframe look on a mobile device?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

## 4. Instructor Review: Wireframing (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with wireframes? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points (✔️):

  * ✔️ Wireframes

  * ✔️ page layout

  * ✔️ Containers

* Open `01-Wireframing/Images/01-wireframe-form-completed.png` and explain the following image:

  * We started with our header and sub-heading already defined which leaves us with the body and footer to complete.

  * 🔑 The next section is the row which will hold three card elements that will have their own container.

  * Inside of our row we have columns which hold the data being displayed on the cards.

  * 🔑 The container which holds our column acts similar to our row container but on the opposite axis.

  * Our wireframe may not look pretty but it gives us some great insight on how our website may look and feel.

  * 🔑 Say we noticed one section of our website is not what we thought or wanted, a wireframe gives us the opportunity to catch this before we begin coding.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Are wireframes supposed to be functional?

  * 🙋 No, it is a rough draft of the UI/UX.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [Wikipedia Page on Website Wireframe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Flexbox Layout (5 min)

* Open `02-Flexbox-Layout/Solved/index.html` in your browser demonstrate the following:

  * In this activity we can see that we have a nice layout for some cards on the page. The layout didn't start out looking like this however.

  * Explain that this is the design we want to achieve through the use of flexbox.

* Open `02-Flexbox-Layout/Unsolved/index.html` in your browser demonstrate the following:

  * In the version you will start out with, you can see that the items are displayed in cards and spill off the screen.

  * Open the Chrome developer tools and use the mobile device emulator to display the problematic nature of this design especially on a device like a phone. Refer to the [Google Docs on Device Mode](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/device-mode/) for more detailed information on how to enter device mode.

  * The goal is to implement Flexbox into our layout to allow for a more responsive design.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 Most modern websites we can visit features some form of flexbox or flex grid to achieve a desired look.

  * ☝️ How will implementing flexbox help us complete this activity?

  * 🙋 Flexbox will allow us to prevent elements from spilling off the webpage.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We can do this by adding a `display` property with a value of `flex` and using the `flex-wrap` property to achieve the desired result.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Flexbox Layout (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Flexbox-Layout/README.md`.

  ```md
  # 🐛 Product Cards Run Off the Page

  Work with a partner to resolve the following issues:

  * As a user, I want to view all products in two or more rows.

  * As a user, I don't want to scroll horizontally to see additional products.

  ## Expected Behavior

    Product cards that don't fit within the first row should display on the next row.

  ## Actual Behavior

  Product cards run off the page in a single row.

  ## Assets

  The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance:

  ![On an online store's webpage, products are spread over two stacked rows of three cards each.](./Images/01-product-grid.png)

  ---

  ## 💡 Hints

  * What additional flexbox properties could help direct the behavior of child elements?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner:

  * By default, flexbox runs in rows, left to right. In what other directions could it run?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 7. Instructor Review: Flexbox Layout (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with flexbox layouts? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points (✔️):

  * ✔️ `display: flex`

  * ✔️ `flex-wrap: wrap`

* Open `02-Flexbox-Layout/Unsolved/index.html` in your browser and explain the following:

  * Let's open Chrome DevTools and toggle the device toolbar. When we make the screen smaller, notice what happens to the header and the product cards. The text in the header is squished, and the product cards run off the page!

  * So we know that the broken code that we need to debug and fix is the `.main-header` and the product cards in the `main` container.

* Open `02-Flexbox-Layout/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 The `main` container and the `.main-header` already have the `display` property set to `flex`:

    ```css
    main {
      display: flex;
    }

    .main-header {
      display: flex;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 We just need to set the `flex-wrap` property to `wrap` so that the elements are forced to wrap over to the next line if they don't fit:

    ```css
    main {
      display: flex;
      /* Forces elements to the next line if they don't fit */
      flex-wrap: wrap;
    }

    .main-header {
      display: flex;
      /* Forces elements to the next line if they don't fit */
      flex-wrap: wrap;
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ By default, flexbox runs in rows, left to right. Which other directions could it run in?

  * 🙋 Flexbox can also run from top to bottom in columns!

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 09. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

  * 🙋 Today we learned how to utilize flexbox for slick and responsive layouts, and ensure the page looks the way we want. We also learned the importance of wireframing and planning out the visual layout of the elements before we start coding.

  * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

  * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful.

  * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

  * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

  * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

  * 🙋 Lesson 2 for both flexbox and wireframing.

  * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

  * 🙋 Responsive-design, pseudo-class selectors, and CSS variables will really fill out our CSS skill set!

### 10. Challenge Review (30 min)

* Take this time to help get students unblocked on the current Challenge that they are working through.

* Expect that students may ask for the following:

  * Further review on a particular subject

  * Debugging assistance

  * Help with computer issues

  * Guidance with a particular tool
