# Module 02 Instructor Overview: Advanced CSS

## Overview

In this module, students will build on their foundational HTML, CSS, and Git skills as they learn advanced CSS. Students will learn how to use powerful CSS layout tools, such as media queries and flexbox, to make their webpages mobile-responsive. This module also teaches Git workflow, including moving among branches and resolving merge conflicts.

In this week's virtual classes, you'll review wireframing, flexbox, responsive design, and other advanced CSS properties such as pseudo-classes and CSS variables.

The following table maps the key topics covered in the virtual lessons to where they are taught in the asynchronous content:

| Day | Topic             | Location |
| --- | ----------------- | -------- |
| 1   | Wireframing       | 2.1      |
| 1   | Flexbox layout    | 2.2      |
| 1   | Git Guide         | N/A      |
| 2   | Responsive design | 2.2, 2.3 |
| 2   | Pseudo-classes    | 2.4      |
| 2   | CSS variables     | 2.5      |

## Overview of Asynchronous Material

Why are students learning advanced CSS?

* Students need to be able to create responsive designs for their web applications.

* Employers are looking for candidates with strong CSS skills who don't rely on frameworks.

* Employers will expect students to know how to use CSS variables and media queries.

* Employers will expect students to understand and use CSS selectors beyond single classes or elements.

Throughout the async module this week, students will use advanced CSS to do the following:

* Create a mobile-responsive layout using advanced CSS layout techniques, including flexbox.

* Create a fully mobile-responsive website using media queries.

* Create an attractive and intuitive user interface using advanced CSS selectors and custom properties.

* Publish the page to the web using GitHub Pages.

**Reminder**: If students need help with an async activity, encourage them to attend Office Hours. If they need more help, remind them that they can use Learning Assistants via the AskBCS bot.

The following table contains a description of each lesson's portion of the module project and the corresponding key points that are taught:

## Virtual Classes

Here are the lesson plans for this week's virtual classes:

* [02.1 Virtual Class](./02.1-REQUIRED.md)

* [02.2 Virtual Class](./02.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* This module is long and covers a lot of ground. Students might be feeling overwhelmed. Ensure them that this feeling is expected, and that it's not essential to master CSS at this point, if ever.

* At the time of this class, students will be at an early stage in their module project, so be prepared to answer questions related to the first few lessons.

* Even though flexbox seems simple at first glance, this is students' first exposure to CSS. Review the activities ahead of time to be sure that you are familiar with what they will encounter.

### Common Pain Points

According to our class data, students might experience some of the following pain points this week:

| Pain Point                       | Recommendation                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Selecting elements               | Refer to the [MDN Web Docs on CSS selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors).                    |
| Arranging elements using flexbox | Introduce students to a flexbox CSS game. You should be able to find several examples via Google.                                              |
| Memorizing flexbox properties    | Ask students to use Google to find a flexbox cheat sheet. A great example can be found on the website [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/).   |

## Career Connection

During each lesson that students work through, they will also view a Career Connection section that will tie together the academic content with career services and how this material will be applicable to them in their future career.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Coach and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp).

If you'd like more information on career services, visit the [career services resources page](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp).

## Module Challenge

For the [Module 02 Challenge](../../01-Class-Content/02-Advanced-CSS/02-Challenge), students will create their first portfolio page from scratch using advanced CSS and HTML. This project allows students to show off their skills by incrementally adding to and improving the portfolio page.

Students must know how to implement the following skills in order to succeed in this week's Challenge:

* Organizing content using flexbox

* Implementing media queries to make the page responsive

* Styling elements on the page using classes and CSS selectors

* Placing text on top of images using CSS

## Heads-Up

Next week, you will introduce students to JavaScript. This might be a big leap for some students. Try to recall your experience when you first learned JavaScript. What concepts seem obvious now but weren't when you started learning? Be prepared to answer a lot of questions and be available during Office Hours.
