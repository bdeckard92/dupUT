# Module 02 Instructor Overview: Advanced CSS

## Overview

In this week's virtual classes, you'll review flexbox, media queries, CSS Grid, and other advanced CSS properties, like pseudo-classes and CSS variables.

## Virtual Classes

[Recommended](./02.1-RECOMMENDED.md)

[Required](./02.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* This module is long and covers a lot of ground. Students are likely feeling overwhelmed. Ensure them that this feeling is normal and expected, and that it's not essential to master CSS at this point, if ever.

* Students will be early on in their work on the module, so be prepared to answer questions related to the first few lessons of the module.

* While flexbox is simple at the surface, this is students' first exposure to CSS. Look over the activities ahead of time to be sure you are familiar with what they will encounter.

## Career Connection

During each lesson that students work through, they will also view a Career Connection section that will tie together the academic content with Career Services and how this material will be applicable to them in their future career.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Director and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careerservicesonlineevents.splashthat.com/).
