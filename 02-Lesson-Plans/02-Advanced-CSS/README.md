# Module 02 Instructor Overview: Advanced CSS

## Overview

## Virtual Classes

[Recommended](./02.1-RECOMMENDED.md)

[Required](./02.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* This module is long and covers a lot of ground. Students are likely feeling overwhelmed. Ensure them that this feeling is normal and expected, and that it's not essential to master CSS at this point, if ever.

## Career Connection

During each lesson that students work through, they will also view a Career Connection section that will tie together the academic content with Career Services, and how this material will be applicable to them in their future career.

Remind sudents that they should reach out to their Career Director and meet with them often throughout boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also sign up for [workshops](https://careerservicesonlineevents.splashthat.com/).
