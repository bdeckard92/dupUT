# Module 02 Virtual Class: Advanced CSS

## Overview

In today's virtual class, students will review responsive design, pseudo-classes, and CSS variables.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Implement a flexbox layout for a responsive web design.

* Use pseudo-classes to style very specific elements

* Use CSS variables for easier style changes within their CSS

## Instructor Notes

* In today's class, you will introduce and demonstrate the module Challenge. Find time prior to class to install dependencies, read the acceptance criteria, and familiarize yourself with the application functionality so you are prepared to answer any questions.

* Today's concepts are on the more difficult side of CSS. Be sure to go over the activities prior to class to make sure you are ready to best assist students with these topics.

* CSS can be frustrating! If students struggle, let them know that through struggle comes the strongest learnings.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Pseudo-classes and variables are introduced in Lesson 5 as part of some last-minute touch-ups to Run Buddy.

## Office Hours

Encourage students to work on the remaining module algorithms during Office Hours. Review the algorithm solutions 5–10 minutes before class begins or during Office Hours after class.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What did you learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

  * 🙋 We covered Flexbox, Media Queries, Pseudo-classes, and finally CSS Variables. This is a great tool set to create some great looking pages! We are moving fast compared to traditional learners. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

  * ☝️ Did anyone have an "Aha!" or "Eureka!" moment this week? When was it and why did things suddenly click for you?

  * 🙋 Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we're thinking about it.

  * ☝️ Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

  * 🙋 It's easy to get stuck when you're learning web development. It's important to learn how to get unstuck because it happens to the pros too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the tool's official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups are great because explaining your problems to someone else often reveals the solution.

### 2. Introduce Module Challenge (5 min)

* Open [02-Challenge/Main/index.html](../../01-Class-Content/02-Advanced-CSS/02-Challenge/Main/index.html) in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * We see a nice portfolio that contains a navbar with our brand, and some links.

  * The page also contains a hero banner with right-bottom positioned subtitle, along with 3 separate information sections below it.

  * The page uses CSS Flexbox to display work with elements of varying size to give a clean look.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What recently acquired skills will help us build this challenge?

  * 🙋 Flexbox, media queries, and some more advanced CSS topics!

  * ☝️ How are these skills relevant to a career in web development?

  * 🙋 Learning more advanced CSS with nice layouts creates pages that standout.

  * ☝️ How will this challenge improve your portfolio?

  * 🙋 This challenge will solidify the skills needed for you to create a stand-out portfolio

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 3. Instructor Demo: Responsive Design (5 min)

* Open `03-Responsive-Design/Solved/index.html` in your browser and explain the following:

  * This activity implements a responsive design as you can see when we use device mode in our chrome developer tools.
  
  * You can see as we switch from mobile phone, to tablet, to responsive the page adapts accordingly. Even though we changed the viewport of the browser, all the elements arrange themselves in a way that makes sense for the given screen size. This is what it means to achieve mobile responsiveness.

  * For this activity, the code is already written for you. You will be taking a look at the CSS file included with the activity and adding some codes to describe the functionality of specific CSS properties that exist in the file.

* Open `03-Responsive-Design/Unsolved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE to demonstrate the following:

  * Here we can see that the places where we need to add comments are denoted with a `TODO:` comment.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why is it worthwhile to implement mobile responsiveness in your webpage?

  * 🙋 Mobile devices accounted for roughly 63% of all devices visiting webpages in 2020 and that trend is likely to continue. We need to make sure that our site is usable and looks nice for desktop browsers, tablets, phones and possible some other device that doesn't exist yet.

  * ☝️ How does this activity help us understand how to make a website mobile responsive?

  * 🙋 This activity gives us some insight on what CSS attributes affect the page.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We can use Google to research different CSS properties.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Responsive Design  (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `03-Wireframing/README.md`.

* Also provide students with the [mockup.png](../../01-Class-Content/02-Advanced-CSS/01-Activities/03-Wireframing/Images/100-completed-wireframe.png) image.

```md
# 📐 Add Comments to Implementation of a Responsive Design

Work with a partner to add comments describing the functionality of the code found in [Unsolved/assets/css/style.css](./Unsolved/assets/css/style.css).

---

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner:

* What other CSS property can we use to create responsive layouts?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
```

### 5. Instructor Review: Responsive Design (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with responsive web design using media queries and flexbox? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points (✔️):

  * ✔️ `display: flex`

  * ✔️ `flex-wrap`

  * ✔️ `justify-content`

  * ✔️ `flex` shorthand

  * ✔️ `flex-direction`

* Open `03-Responsive-Design/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * This activity didn't require any coding on our part. Instead we were given a fully functioning webpage, and we had to explain how it works! Through this kind of activity, we can improve our computational thinking skills.

* Go through each question (🔑) in the `style.css` and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * 🔑 What happens when we set the `display` property to `flex`, as shown in the following example?

      ```css
    nav {
      display: flex;
    }
    ```

  * 🙋 The `flex` container becomes flexible! The child items of the container all move into a row and take only as much space as they need to display their contents.

  * 🔑 What is the `flex-wrap` property?

  * 🙋 It specifies whether the flex items should wrap or not. The value can be set to `nowrap`, `wrap-reverse`, or `wrap`, like in the following example:

    ```css
    main {
      display: flex;
      flex-wrap: wrap;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 What does the `justify-content` property do?

  * 🙋 It aligns the flex items and distributes the empty space between them. In this activity, we are telling the product cards to be centered:

    ```css
    .products {
      flex: 4;
      display: flex;
      flex-wrap: wrap;
      justify-content: center;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 What is the `flex` property a shorthand property for?

  * 🙋 It is a shorthand property for the `flex-grow` and `flex-basis` properties&mdash;in that order. In this activity, we are making the product cards not growable and not shrinkable, with an initial length of 400px:

    ```css
    .card {
      flex: 0 0 400px;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 What does the `flex-direction` property define?

  * 🙋 It defines in which direction the container wants to stack its flex items. In this activity, we are telling the main body element and the navbar to stack vertically in a column:

    ```css
    @media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
      main,
      nav {
        flex-direction: column;
      }
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What other CSS property can we use to create responsive layouts?

  * 🙋 We can use the CSS grid layout.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on the CSS Flexible Box Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Pseudo-Classes(5 min)

* Open `04-Pseudo-Classes/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 This is a basic webpage with a heading, a list of links, and two paragraphs.

  * 🔑 When hovering over the "Show Resources" `div`, an unordered list (`ul`) of links they appears when we hover over the `div`.

  * 🔑 Notice that when the page is loaded, these links are hidden automatically.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We used pseudo-classes to style the links, input elements, and "What You Do" steps on the Run Buddy webpage in Lesson 5.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  * 🙋 These selectors will allow us to be more particular about our styles.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We would look at our start code, and compare it to the provided mockup. From there we can begin to style each piece little by little using CSS pseudo-classes.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Pseudo-classes (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Pseudo-Classes/README.md`.

* Also remind students to refer to the included images located in `04-Pseudo-Classes/Images` for how the element should look when hidden or visible.

```md
# 🏗️ Implement an Interactive Resources List

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a user, I want additional resource links at the bottom of the article.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the resource links are initially hidden on page load.

* It's done when the user moves the mouse over the text "Show Resources," and the resource links display.

## Assets

The following image demonstrates the web application's default appearance and functionality:

![The text "Show Resources" appears below an article titled "Building Responsive Layouts."](./Images/01-resources-closed.png)

The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality when the cursor is over the "Show Resources" text:

![Three links to the MDN Web Docs appear under the text "Show Resources."](./Images/02-resources-open.png)

You can use the following resource links for the content:

* [MDN Web Docs on responsive design](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design)

* [MDN Web Docs on using media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries)

* [MDN Web Docs on flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox)

---

## 💡 Hints

* How would the CSS `display` property help?

* What examples can you find of other developers using the `:hover` pseudo-class in creative ways?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner:

* How can you force pseudo-class styles to display using Chrome DevTools?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
```

### 8. Instructor Review: Pseudo-classes  (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with pseudo-classes? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ `:hover` pseudo-class

  * ✔️ `display: none` vs `display: block`

* Open `04-Pseudo-Classes/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We added `<h3>` and `<ul>` elements inside of the resources `<div>`:

    ```html
    <div class="resources">
      <h3>
        Show Resources
      </h3>
      <ul class="links">
        <li>
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design">MDN Web Docs on responsive design</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries">MDN Web Docs on using media queries</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox">MDN Web Docs on flexbox</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    ```

* Open `04-Pseudo-Classes/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We initially set the `<ul>` element to `display: none` to remove it from the document flow:

    ```css
    .resources .links {
      display: none;
      padding: 1% 0;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 When the parent `.resources` element is in a hover state, we change the `display` of the child `.links` element to `block`. This returns it to the document flow, but only while the parent is in its hover state:

    ```css
    .resources:hover .links {
      display: block;
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ When is an element in a hover state?

  * 🙋 When the cursor is inside that element.

  * ☝️ What elements can have a `:hover` pseudo-class added to them?

  * 🙋 All the elements!

  * ☝️ What does `display: none` do to an element?

  * 🙋 It removes the element from the document flow.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on pseudo-classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) and the [MDN Web Docs on display](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Instructor Demo: CSS Variables (5 min)

* Open `05-CSS-Variables/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 The colors and border radius in this page are all populated in the CSS using CSS Variables.
  
  * CSS Variables, also referred to as custom CSS properties, are useful to avoid having to look up RGB hex codes for specific colors you use frequently.
  
  * CSS Variables are also a form DRY programming, meaning that they allow us to declare the color once and simply refer to it.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We used this to define the three main colors in the Run Buddy style sheet in Lesson 5.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  * 🙋 CSS Variables make things like, swapping out color pallets, very simple. It will allow us to keep recurring rule values stored in variables for reusability.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We extract the colors out of our CSS rules and place them in our newly declared `:root` selector.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 10. Student Do: CSS Variables (20 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `05-CSS-Variables/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# 🏗️ Implement CSS Variables in Style Sheet

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to manage CSS values that are used in multiple CSS rules in a more efficient manner.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when any repeated color values are defined once as a CSS variable.

* It's done when any repeated border radius values are defined once as a CSS variable.

## 💡 Hints

* How can we declare CSS variables, also known as CSS custom properties, on the `:root` pseudo-class?

* How can we use those custom property values instead of using values that are repeated throughout the style sheet such as `#fff`?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner:

* What does the term DRY mean in web development?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 11. Instructor Review: CSS Variables (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with CSS variables? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points (✔️):

  * ✔️ Adding variables to the global style sheet with the `:root` element

  * ✔️ Reducing the risk of a typo with variables

  * ✔️ Not limited to colors

* Open `05-CSS-Variables/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We identify where values are repeated throughout the style sheet.

  * 🔑 Repeating values throughout a style sheet can introduce a lot of errors, so we store them under a named variable:

    ```css
    :root {
      --white: #fff;
      --dark-blue: #13293d;
      --tan: #d8a47f;
      --border-radius: 50px;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 By selecting the root HTML element `:root`, we can make these custom CSS properties (variables) available throughout our style sheet.

  * 🔑 This is great for colors because hex codes are hard to remember, but you can also use it with other values like border radius.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Do we have to use specific names for the variables?

  * 🙋 No, we don't. As long as we use the `--` syntax, we can call them whatever we need to.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on using CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 12. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What do you think you absolutely need to know to succeed at the challenge?

  * 🙋 You will have to know how to utilize flexbox, pseudo-selectors, media queries, and some more advanced CSS topics. Don't worry, you have already gone through activities solidifying all of these skills!

  * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

  * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it is not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful.

  * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material prior to class as possible?

  * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

### 13. Promote Additional Resources (5 min)

* Direct students to the additional resources available to them:

  * Reflection and Retrieval

  * Career Connection

  * Dessert Menu

### 14. End
