# Module 02 Virtual Class (Required): Advanced CSS

## Overview

In today's required virtual class, students will review CSS Grid, pseudo-classes, and CSS variables.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Implement a layout using CSS Grid

* Use pseudo-classes to style very specific elements

* Use CSS variables for easier style changes within their CSS

## Instructor Notes

* In today's class, you will introduce and demonstrate the module Challenge. Find time prior to class to install dependencies, read the acceptance criteria, and familiarize yourself with the application functionality so you are prepared to answer any questions.

* Today's concepts are on the more difficult side of CSS. Be sure to go over the activities prior to class to make sure you are ready to best assist students with these topics.

* CSS can be frustrating! If students struggle, let them know that through struggle comes the strongest learnings.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* CSS Grid is first introduced in Lesson 4 when students add a Service Plan to the Run Buddy webpage. Pseudo-classes and variables are introduced in Lesson 5 as part of some last-minute touch-ups to Run Buddy.

## Office Hours

Encourage students to work on the remaining module algorithms during Office Hours. Review the algorithm solutions 5–10 minutes before class begins or during Office Hours after class.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What did you learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

  * 🙋 We covered Flexbox, CSS Grid, Media Queries, Pseudo-classes, and finally CSS Variables. This is a great tool set to create some great looking pages! We are moving fast compared to traditional learners. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

  * ☝️ Did anyone have an "Aha!" or "Eureka!" moment this week? When was it and why did things suddenly click for you?

  * 🙋 Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we're thinking about it.

  * ☝️ Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

  * 🙋 It's easy to get stuck when you're learning web development. It's important to learn how to get unstuck because it happens to the pros too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the tool's official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups are great because explaining your problems to someone else often reveals the solution.

### 2. Introduce Module Challenge (5 min)

* Open [02-Challenge/Main/index.html](../../01-Class-Content/02-Advanced-CSS/02-Challenge/Main/index.html) in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * We see a nice portfolio that contains a navbar with our brand, and some links.

  * The page also contains a hero banner with right-bottom positioned subtitle, along with 3 separate information sections below it.

  * The page uses CSS Grid to display work with elements of varying size to give a clean look.

  * Each grid item is also a flexbox, centering the content in each.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What recently acquired skills will help us build this challenge?

  * 🙋 Flexbox, CSS Grid, and some more advanced CSS topics!

  * ☝️ How are these skills relevant to a career in web development?

  * 🙋 Learning more advanced CSS with nice layouts creates pages that standout.

  * ☝️ How will this challenge improve your portfolio?

  * 🙋 This challenge will solidify the skills needed for you to create a stand-out portfolio

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 3. Instructor Demo: CSS Grid (5 min)

* Open `03-CSS-Grid/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 This is a simple grid layout, in which we have 6 rows across 8 columns.

  * 🔑 Boxes 3, 6, 9, and 10 differ in their position and size from other elements.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We used this to build a Service Plan table for Run Buddy in Lesson 4.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  * 🙋 This activity requires us to create a grid, and size certain elements differently.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We would start by taking our elements and creating a basic grid container. Then altering the grid by targeting specific elements and changing how many rows and columns they will occupy

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: CSS Grid  (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `03-CSS-Grid/README.md`.

* Also provide students with the [mockup.png](../../01-Class-Content/02-Advanced-CSS/01-Activities/03-CSS-Grid/Images/100-mockup.png) image.

```md
# CSS Grid

In this activity, you will take a basic page containing 10 boxes and organize the layout of it using CSS Grid.

## Instructions

* Open the `style.css` file in your IDE and examine the code.

* Create the following layout:

  * It should be an 8x8 grid.

  * Boxes 3, 6, and 9 each occupy 2 rows spanning 3 columns.

  * Box 10 occupies 4 rows spanning 3 columns.

  * Boxes 3, 6, 9, and 10 are larger than the other grid items.

* Your end result should resemble the layout in the following mockup:

  ![The mockup displays a grid with some items spanning more rows and columns than others.](./Images/100-mockup.png)
```

### 5. Instructor Review: CSS Grid (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ Use grid value in `display` property

  * ✔️ Use `grid-template-columns` and `rows` for layout

  * ✔️ Specifying sizes of elements

  * ✔️ Selectors to target specific elements

* Open `03-CSS-Grid/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 First we target the `div` with the class of `.grid-container` and give it `display: grid`, and specify `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows`. We will use the second 2 rules to dictate the size of our grid in rows/columns

  ```css
  .grid-container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(8, 1fr);
    grid-template-rows: repeat(8, 1fr);
  }
  ```

  * Now that we have our ten items across two rows. Lets space them out evenly and make it look a little nicer. We can do that by adding a `grid-gap` rule.

  ```css
  .grid-container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(8, 1fr);
    grid-template-rows: repeat(8, 1fr);
    grid-gap: 20px;
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 Now that we have our basic layout, let's target elements and make them occupy the spaces specified in the instructions. Starting with grid-item 10, let's make it two rows spanning three columns using `grid-column` and `grid-row` rules.

  ```css
  .item-10 {
    grid-column: 2 / span 3;
    grid-row: 2 / span 4;
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 We write CSS to specify that every third item (3, 6, and 9) should span three columns and span two rows using the same rules we did for the grid-item 10. To specify every 3rd element, we use `grid-item:nth-child(3n)` selector and adding the appropriate rules.

  ```css
  .grid-item:nth-child(3n) {
    grid-column: span 3;
    grid-row: span 2;
  }
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How is CSS Grid helpful to us?

  * 🙋 We can use it to easily setup a grid style layout, dictating how many items we would like per column/row.

  * ☝️ When using `grid-column` or `grid-row`, what does `X / span Y` mean?

  * 🙋 These two rule names are shorthand for specifying the `start` and `end` positions. So when providing two integers, we are specifying the `start` and `end` of the column or row.

  * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to the lessons, read the [MDN Web Docs on CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Pseudo-classes(5 min)

* Open `04-Pseudo-Classes/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 This is a basic webpage with a heading, a list of links, and two paragraphs.

  * 🔑 When hovering over list items, they show a color on hover and the potato emoji turns to a heart. 

  * 🔑 The first line of the first paragraph is bolded and the first letter of the second paragraph is styled uniquely.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We used pseudo-classes to style the links, input elements, and "What You Do" steps on the Run Buddy webpage in Lesson 5.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  * 🙋 These selectors will allow us to be more particular about our styles.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We would look at our start code, and compare it to the provided mockup. From there we can begin to style each piece little by little using CSS pseudo-classes.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Pseudo-classes (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Pseudo-Classes/README.md`.

* Also provide students with the [mockup.png](../../01-Class-Content/02-Advanced-CSS/01-Activities/04-Pseudo-Classes/Images/100-mockup.png) image.

```md
# Pseudo-classes

In this activity, you will take a webpage and style specific elements using pseudo-classes.

## Instructions

* Open `index.html` in your browser and look at the current styling.

* Open the `style.css` file in your IDE and examine the code.

* Using the comments to guide you, add the following styles using only CSS:

  * On hover, the list items will change colors, become bolded, and drop a shadow.

  * Also on hover, the list item icon will change from a potato emoji (🥔) to a heart emoji (❤️).

  * Style the list with alternate background colors.

  * The first line of the first paragraph should be bold.

  * The first letter in the second paragraph should have the following style:

    * font weight of `900`

    * font size of `x-large`

    * color of `red`

    * font family of `cursive`

* Your end result should resemble the style in the following mockup:

  ![The mockup shows that different styles are applied to specific HTML elements on the page](./Images/100-mockup.png)
```

### 8. Instructor Review: Pseudo-classes  (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ `:hover`

  * ✔️ `::before`

  * ✔️ `:hover::before`
  
  * ✔️ `:nth-child()`

  * ✔️ `::first-line`
  
  * ✔️ `::first-letter`

* Open `04-Pseudo-Classes/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We use `:hover` to specify how the styles will change when the mouse is hovering over the item&mdash;in our case the list item.

  ```css
  li:hover {
    color: purple;
    font-weight: 900;
    list-style-type: none;
    text-shadow: 2px 2px lightpink;
  }
  ```
  
  * 🔑 We use `::before` to add a potato emoji in front of each list item.

  ```css
  li::before {
    content: "🥔";
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 We use the more specific `:hover::before` to say that on hover, change the potato to the heart emoji.

  ```css
  li:hover::before {
    content: "❤️";
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 To create the alternate background color look of the list, we will use the `:nth-child` pseudo-class. To alternate from color to no color starting with the first element, we will use `:nth-child(2n-1)`.

  ```css
  li:nth-child(2n-1) {
    background-color: wheat;
  }
  ```

  * The `::first-line` pseudo-class allows us to set the `font-weight` of just the first line of a block of text.

  ```css
  .intro::first-line {
    font-weight: 900;
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 Our final pseudo-class will be `::first-letter`. To this we are going to apply four rules: `font-weight`, `font-size`, `color`, and `font-family` to style the first `S`.

  ```css
  .conclusion::first-letter {
    font-weight: 900;
    font-size: x-large;
    color: red;
    font-family: cursive;
  }
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How are these pseudo-classes helpful?

  * 🙋 They allow us to be much more specific with our style, rounding out our ability to fully customize a page from top to bottom.

  * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understanding this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to the lessons, read the [MDN Web Docs on Pseudo-classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Instructor Demo: CSS Variables (5 min)

* Open `05-CSS-Variables/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 The colors in this page are all populated in the CSS using CSS Variables.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We used this to define the three main colors in the Run Buddy style sheet in Lesson 5.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  * 🙋 CSS Variables make things like, swapping out color pallets, very simple. It will allow us to keep recurring rule values stored in variables for reusability.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We extract the colors out of our CSS rules and place them in our newly declared `:root` selector.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 10. Student Do: CSS Variables (20 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `05-CSS-Variables/README.md`.

```md
# CSS Variables

In this activity, you will take a CSS stylesheet and extract the colors into CSS Variables.

## Instructions

* Open the `style.css` file in your IDE and examine the code. 

* Create five CSS variables at the root of the document, extracting the appropriate color hex codes from the CSS provided. The five variables should be named:

  * light

  * light-blue

  * sapphire

  * dark-blue

  * dark

* Open `index.html` in your browser to see which colors corresponds with each CSS variable.

* Replace the corresponding occurrences of the color hex codes with the new CSS variables.
```

### 11. Instructor Review: CSS Variables (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ `--varName: value;`

  * ✔️ `color: var(--varName);`

* Open `05-CSS-Variables/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We select the `:root` element. Then we take a color and assign it to a variable using the syntax `--varName: value;`. For example, we take `#F9EDED` and place it into a variable named `--light`. 

  ```css
  :root {
    --light: #F9EDED;
  }
  ```

  * We do the same with `#337EAA`, `#1D6768`, `#29364F`, `#181B26`, and place them into `--light-blue`, `--sapphire`, `--dark-blue`, `--dark` respectively. 

  ```css
  :root {
    --light: #F9EDED;
    --light-blue: #337EAA;
    --sapphire: #1D6768;
    --dark-blue: #29364F;
    --dark: #181B26;
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 To use the variables we make, we use the following syntax:

  ```css
  element {
    color: var(--varName);
  }
  ```

  * We replace all corresponding occurrences of the hex codes with the new variable names.

  ```css
  body {
    background-color: var(--light);
  }

  .header-wrapper nav a {
    color: var(--light);
    border-right: 2px solid var(--light-blue);
  }

  .header-wrapper h1 {
    background-color: var(--sapphire);
  }

  header {
    background-color: var(--dark-blue);
  }

  #main-content {
    float: left;
    color: var(--light);
    background: var(--dark);
  }
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why are CSS variables useful?

  * 🙋 They allow us to easily swap out values that are repeated throughout a stylesheet. Change the value of the variable, and anywhere that variable shows up is changed!

  * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understanding this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to the lessons, read the [MDN Web Docs on CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 12. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What do you think you absolutely need to know to succeed at the challenge?

  * 🙋 You will have to know how to utilize flexbox, CSS Grid, pseudo-selectors, media queries, and some more advanced CSS topics. Don't worry, you have already gone through activities solidifying all of these skills!

  * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

  * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it is not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful.

  * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material prior to class as possible?

  * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

### 13. Promote Additional Resources (5 min)

* Direct students to the additional resources available to them:

  * Reflection and Retrieval

  * Career Connection

  * Dessert Menu

### 14. Office Hours (30 min)
