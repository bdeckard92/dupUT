# Module 13 Virtual Class: Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)

## Overview

In today's virtual class, students will continue learning about the CRUD methods. Activities will also focus on how to relate data between SQL tables using Sequelize associations and how to model one-to-one and one-to-many relationships.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Perform CRUD operations with Sequelize methods.

* Implement various Sequelize associations to create one-to-one and one-to-many data relationships.

## Instructor Notes

* At the beginning of today‚Äôs class, remind students to complete the Midpoint Survey that covers their journey thus far. It‚Äôs important that they are aware of this in advance and that they take their time to complete the survey. This will ultimately help us understand how the program, the curriculum, the instruction, and our support can be improved!

* Be sure to prepare and review the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions that students might have.

* During activities, quietly visit a few breakout rooms, ask the groups whether they are comfortable with the activity, and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* Make sure you change all of the connection information so the examples have your MySQL username/password!

* Instead of relying on a front end, all of the activities will use Insomnia to test the routes. Be sure to have it installed and set up for class.

* To speed up demonstrations and activity reviews, you might want to run `npm install` and create the database for every activity before class starts.

* The `03-Update-Delete` activity includes a `/seed` POST route simply to make it easier to quickly populate the database with books.

* For the other activities, don't forget to run `node seeds/seed.js` before each demo or activity review, to seed the database. Remind students of the seed file too.

* All activities will require changing the `.env.EXAMPLE` file to `.env` and filling it with your MySQL credentials. Instruct students who arrive early to fill out that information ahead of time so that they can focus on the task at hand.

* Lesson 1 covered CRUD methods, and associations are covered in Lessons 3 and 4.

## Office Hours

Encourage students to work on the remaining module algorithms during Office Hours. Review the algorithm solutions 5‚Äì10 minutes before class begins or during Office Hours after class.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Remind students to complete the Midpoint Survey to help us understand how the program, the curriculum, the instruction, and our support can be improved. Clarify that this survey is NOT about the current module but is about the entire course up until this point!

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What did you learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

  * üôã We learned about Sequelize, which is a Promise-based Node.js ORM for MySQL. We are moving fast compared to traditional learners, and it‚Äôs okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don‚Äôt give up!

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Did anyone have an aha or eureka moment this week? When was it, and why did things suddenly click for you?

  * üôã Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we're thinking about it.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

  * üôã It's easy to get stuck when you're learning web development. It's important to learn how to get unstuck, because it happens to the pros too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the tool's official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups can be helpful, because explaining your problems to someone else often reveals the solution.

### 2. Review Current Challenge (5 min)

* Navigate to `02-Challenge/Main/` from the command line and run `node server.js`.

* Open <http://localhost:3001/api/products> in a browser and demonstrate the following:

  * You're going to build the API routes for a products database.

  * Products belong to a category and can have many tags each.

  * You'll be using an ORM called Sequelize to help you define your data's relationships and execute complicated queries.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Which recently acquired skills will help us build this challenge?

  * üôã We will be using Sequelize as the ORM for this application. We will use the CRUD methods to query our products database as well as the tags.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How are these skills relevant to a career in web development?

  * üôã Professional applications rely on ORMs to make the data easier to define and understand. ORMs also implement many safeguards for us to prevent bad or malicious data.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How will this challenge improve your portfolio?

  * üôã It will demonstrate a firm understanding of databases and ORMs.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 3. Instructor Demo: Update/Delete (5 min)

* Navigate to `03-Update-Delete/` from the command line and run the following command to ensure that the `library_db` database has been created:

  ```bash
  mysql -u root -p < db/schema.sql
  ```

* Navigate to `03-Update-Delete` in your command line and be sure to change the `.env.EXAMPLE` file into your own `.env` file with your credentials.

* Next, run `npm i` and `npm start` from the command line to install the dependencies and start the server.

* In Insomnia, create a new POST request to `/api/books/seed` to make sure that the database is populated with seed data.

* Using Insomnia, execute the following queries to demonstrate the CRUD methods:

  * üîë Get all books from the database.

  * üîë Update one of the properties on a book by using the id to find it.

  * üîë Delete a book by id.

  * üîë Note that in this activity, we are focusing only on the update and delete methods.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Where have we used this before?

  * üôã We used `update` and `delete` methods in the `User` model in Lesson 1 and in the `Post` model in Lesson 3.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

  * üôã We will need to use methods to query the products database.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?

  * üôã We need to use Sequelize CRUD methods in the appropriate routes.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Update/Delete  (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `03-Update-Delete/README.md`.

  ```md
  # üèóÔ∏è Implement the PUT and DELETE Route with Your Own Parameters

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a bookstore owner, I want to be able to update and remove certain books of my choice from the inventory.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when a book is updated with new information (like 'numberOfPages').

  * It's done when a book can be deleted based on specific parameters (like 'book_id').

  ## üí° Hints

  Which option do you need to use on the method call?

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * Which SQL operators does Sequelize support?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 5. Instructor Review: Update/Delete  (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with the UPDATE and DELETE methods in Sequelize? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `update()`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `destroy()`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `WHERE`

* Open `03-Update-Delete/Solved/routes/api/bookRoute.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * üîë Use the `update()` method on the `Book` model, mapping the request body to the proper fields in the database, as follows:

    ```js
    router.put('/:book_id', (req, res) => {
      Book.update(
      {
        title: req.body.title,
        author: req.body.author,
        isbn: req.body.isbn,
        pages: req.body.pages,
        edition: req.body.edition,
        is_paperback: req.body.is_paperback,
      },
    ```

  * üîë We add optional parameters to the `update()` method to specify which book we want to update with the `WHERE` clause. We use the request parameters to retrieve the `book_id` of the desired book, as follows:

    ```js
    where: {
      book_id: req.params.book_id,
    },
    ```

  * We then send the response with the updated book or catch any errors that might occur, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    .then((updatedBook) => {
        res.json(updatedBook);
      })
      .catch((err) => {
        console.log(err);
        res.json(err);
      });
    ```

  * üîë Inside the DELETE route, use the `destroy()` method on the `Book` model. We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the book we want to delete from the database, as follows:

    ```js
    router.delete('/:book_id', (req, res) => {

    Book.destroy({
      where: {
        book_id: req.params.book_id,
      },
    })
      .then((deletedBook) => {
        res.json(deletedBook);
      })
      .catch((err) => res.json(err));
    });
    ```

* üîë Note how Express.js uses the `delete` keyword for DELETE routes but Sequelize uses the `destroy` keyword. This easy mistake can prevent your route from working properly.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What does the `WHERE` clause do?

  * üôã Helps us specify where in the database we want to look.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [Sequelize documentation on model querying basics](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/model-querying-basics.html), and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: One-to-One  (5 min)

* Navigate to `04-One-to-One/Solved` and run `npm i` from the command line. Be sure to change the `.env.EXAMPLE` file into your own `.env` file with your credentials. Then run `npm start` from the command line and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë By default, Sequelize outputs the commands that it performs on the SQL server to the console, even on load:

    ```bash
    $ node server.js dev
    Executing (default): CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `reader` (`id` INTEGER NOT NULL auto_increment , `name` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, `email` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE, `password` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (`id`)) ENGINE=InnoDB;
    Executing (default): SHOW INDEX FROM `reader`
    Executing (default): CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `library_card` (`id` INTEGER NOT NULL auto_increment , `card_number` CHAR(36) BINARY, `reader_id` INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY (`id`), FOREIGN KEY (`reader_id`) REFERENCES `reader` (`id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE) ENGINE=InnoDB;
    Executing (default): SHOW INDEX FROM `library_card`
    Now listening on port 3001
    ```

  * In these statements that create the tables, Sequelize is using the default database. We can change this by using the `database` option in the `.env` file. The `library_card` table stores a reference to the `reader` table.

* Open `04-One-to-One/Solved/package.json` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * In this activity, we included a "watch" script in the `package.json` file to automatically run `nodemon server` when we execute `npm run watch`. This allows us to observe the changes we make to the project in real time by using a utility called `nodemon`.

  * `nodemon` is a tool that automatically restarts the Node.js server when we make changes to the code. It can be helpful when we are making changes to code but don't want to have to restart the server every time we make a change.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why would we want `library_card` data to have a reference to a `reader`?

  * üôã We can use this to link a reader to a library card. This allows us to keep track of a reader's library cards.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What does the `FOREIGN KEY` clause do?

  * üôã It specifies that the `library_card` table references the `reader` table.

  * ‚òù What resources can we use to learn how to create associations in Sequelize?

  * üôã Refer to the [Sequelize documentation on associations](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/assocs.html).

### 7. Student Do: One-to-One  (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-One-to-One/README.md`.

  ```md
  # üìê Add Comments to Implementation of a One-to-One Association

  Work with a partner to add comments describing the functionality of the code found in the following files:

  * [models/index.js](./Unsolved/models/index.js)

  * [models/LibraryCard.js](./Unsolved/models/LibraryCard.js)

  * [routes/api/readerRoutes.js](./Unsolved/routes/api/readerRoutes.js)

  * [routes/api/libraryCardRoutes.js](./Unsolved/routes/api/libraryCardRoutes.js)

  ## üìù Notes

  Refer to the documentation:

  [Sequelize documentation on associations](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/assocs.html)

  ---

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What is an entity-relationship diagram (ERD)?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 8. Instructor Review: One-to-One  (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with one-to-one relationships in Sequelize? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use Office Hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `hasOne()`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Foreign key columns

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `belongsTo`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Performing JOIN with `include` option

* Open `04-One-to-One/Solved/models/LibraryCard.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * üîë We create a foreign key column to reference the library card's `Reader`, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    reader_id: {
      type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
      references: {
        model: 'reader',
        key: 'id',
      },
    },
    ```

* Open `04-One-to-One/Solved/models/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * üîë We import both models, associate them to one another, and export them as an object, like in the following example:

    ```js
    const Reader = require('./Reader');
    const LibraryCard = require('./LibraryCard');
    ```

    * üîë To associate the `Reader` model with the `LibraryCard` model in a one-to-one relationship, we use the `hasOne()` method to declare that a model has one of another model, or in this case, the `Reader` has one `LibraryCard`. The foreign key will be defined on the `Reader` model:

      ```js
      Reader.hasOne(LibraryCard, {
        foreignKey: 'reader_id',
        onDelete: 'CASCADE',
      });
      ```

    * üîë We then use the `belongsTo()` method to define the relationship between two models. It is important that both `hasOne()` and `belongsTo` are both used. They are a pair!

      ```js
      LibraryCard.belongsTo(Reader, {
        foreignKey: 'reader_id',
      });

      module.exports = { Reader, LibraryCard };
      ```

* Open `04-One-to-One/Solved/routes/api/readerRoutes.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * In the API route files, we import both models through destructuring, as follows:

    ```js
    const { LibraryCard, Reader } = require('../../models');
    ```

  * üîë Also in the API route files, the GET routes use the `include` option to perform a SQL JOIN, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    const readerData = await Reader.findAll({
      include: [{ model: LibraryCard }],
    });
    ```

* If time allows, seed the database, run the app, and use Insomnia to demonstrate the following:

  * We can now create a library card and associate it with a reader by running a POST request to `/api/cards` with the following JSON body:

    ```json
    {
      "reader_id": 1
    }
    ```

  * We can also query a reader and get their associated library card by running a GET request to `/api/readers`.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What would happen if a reader tried to create a second card?

  * üôã They would run into something called a **foreign key constraint**, which helps control data and maintain relationships between tables. This foreign key constraint would prevent users from associating a second library card with a single reader.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [Sequelize documentation on one-to-one relationships](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/assocs.html#one-to-one-relationships), and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Instructor Demo: One-to-Many  (5 min)

* Navigate to `05-One-to-Many` and run `npm install` from the command line. Be sure to change the `.env.EXAMPLE` file into your own `.env` file with your credentials. To speed things up, run `npm run seed` as well to seed the database tables.

* Navigate to `05-One-to-Many/Solved/` in your command line and run `npm start`.

* Use Insomnia to demo the following:

  * üîë When we perform a GET request to `/api/readers/1`, we get a response like the following example, including not only the reader's library card data but also an array of books they've read:

    ```json
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Sal",
      "email": "sal@hotmail.com",
      "password": "$2b$10$QTe2GX3axtbBMGOQgK1RG.l38cSTbX9XnqNHIIPMK/GMbO5jfAiYW",
      "library_card": {
        "id": 1,
        "card_number": "18464192-811d-41ef-9b00-9970e34fbffd",
        "reader_id": 1
      },
      "books": [
        {
          "id": 2,
          "title": "Essential Scrum: A Practical Guide to the Most Popular Agile Process",

          "reader_id": 1
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

  * üîë In the `models/index.js` file, we can import the `Book` model and associate it with the `Reader` model using a Sequelize association method. We also do something similar for library cards and readers.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Can we create a new library card without associating it with a reader?

  * üôã We can; however, the cards will not be assigned to any reader.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What would happen if we tried to associate a library card with a reader that doesn't exist?

  * üôã We'd get a `SequelizeForeignKeyConstraintError` error.

  * ‚òù Which Sequelize methods can we use to associate a reader with a library card?

  * üôã We can use the `hasMany()` method to associate a reader with multiple library cards.

  * ‚òù In the query, how could we retrieve the associated books for a reader?

  * üôã We can use the `include` option to perform a SQL JOIN.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `05-One-to-Many/README.md`.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 10. Student Do: One-to-many  (20 min)

## üí° Hints

When you associate these models, what will the relationship look like? Would users belong to books, or would books belong to users?

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* As a JavaScript developer using Sequelize, why do you still need to know SQL?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.

  * üîë We add a column, as follows, to store a reference to the reader that owns the book:

    ```js
    reader_id: {
      type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
      references: {
        model: 'reader',
        key: 'id',
      },
    },
    ```

* Open `05-One-to-Many/Solved/models/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * üîë We create the relationship between readers and books by using the `hasMany()` relationship to declare that readers have many books, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    Reader.hasMany(Book, {
      foreignKey: 'reader_id',
      onDelete: 'CASCADE',
    });
    ```

  * üîë We pair the `hasMany()` association method with a `belongsTo()` declaration to show that while each reader has many books, a book belongs to a single reader. This forms the one-to-many relationship:

    ```js
    Book.belongsTo(Reader, {
      foreignKey: 'reader_id',
    });
    ```

* Open `05-One-to-Many/Solved/routes/api/readerRoutes.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * üîë We use the `findAll()` to return all of the data and an `include` statement to identify the models we want to join:

    ```js
    const readerData = await Reader.findAll({
      include: [{ model: LibraryCard }, { model: Book }],
    });
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What happens to the books or library cards owned by a reader if that reader is deleted?

  * üôã They will also be deleted, because we set `onDelete: 'CASCADE'`.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [Sequelize documentation on one-to-many relationships](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/assocs.html#one-to-many-relationships), and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 12. Recap & Promote Additional Resources (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What do you think you absolutely need to know to succeed at the challenge?

  * üôã We need to know Sequelize CRUD methods as well as how to make relationships between the models.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

  * üôã All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it is not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material prior to class as possible?

  * üôã It's important both to be fully prepared to start the Challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build on in future lessons. The cutting-edge, real-world skills you learn in the lessons will also be useful in your career as a full-stack web developer.

* Direct students to the additional resources available to them:

  * Reflection and Retrieval

  * Career Connection

  * Dessert Menu
