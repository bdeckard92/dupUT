# Module 13 Virtual Class (Recommended): Object-Relational Mapping

## Overview 

In today's recommended virtual class, students will { @TODO OUTLINE THE CAREER CONNECTION TOPIC }, as well as practice using Sequelize query methods and CRUD methods.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* @TODO { CAREER CONNECTION }

* Utilize Sequelize query methods to retrieve data from the database

* Utilize Sequelize CRUD methods

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate questions students may have.

* Make sure you change all of the connection information so the examples have your MySQL username/password!

* If you don't want to do it live in class, create the databases required for today's exercises before class.

* BE VERY CAREFUL TO NOT GO TOO IN DEPTH. There are a ton of components that make Sequelize work, but much of it is boilerplate that doesn't need much explanation. 

* THIS IS TOUGH STUFF! This week, tell your class to not feel discouraged if there are concepts that they can't nail down completely. Tell them to try their best, but to speak with you or a TA if they're unsure of anything.

* @TODO { REFERENCE TO ASYNC }

## Class Instructions 

### 1. Introduction (5 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Direct students to post individual questions in the Zoom chat to be addressed by TAs and/or at the end of class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

    * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back and see what we accomplished, and acknowledge that it's a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic? 

    * 🙋 Let's do "fist to five" together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 2. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

@TODO CHECK WITH THE LCA, LCE & CS POC


### 3. Instructor Demo: Sequelize Library (5 min) 

* Be sure to have already created the `sequelize_library` DB, run `npm install`, and modified the `connection.js` file to include your MySQL user/database information. Otherwise, walk through it with the class. 

* Navigate to `01-Sequelize-Library/Solved/` in your command line and run `npm start`. 

* Open the browser and go to `localhost:3001` to demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 Add a few books to the library

    * 🔑 Search for books by title, author, genre

    * 🔑 View all books

    * 🔑 View short or long books

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used `findAll()` to retrieve all the posts of a user in Lesson 3.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We will need to use Sequelize to query the database.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We need to use Sequelize query methods to create the required routes. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 4. Student Do: Sequelize Library (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-Sequelize-Library/Unsolved/README.md`.

    ```md
    # Sequelize Library

    In this activity, you will use sequelize query methods to create the required routes.

    ## Instructions

    * Create a `'sequelize_library'` DB.

    * Navigate to the [Unsolved](Unsolved/) folder and run `npm install` in your terminal.

    * Be sure to modify the [connection.js](Unsolved/app/config/connection.js) file to include your MySQL user/database information.

    * In the [api-routes.js](Unsolved/app/routes/api-routes.js) file, modify the following routes to use sequelize query methods:

      * Get all books

      * Get all books of a specific genre

      * Get all books from a specific author

      * Get all "long" books (books with 150 pages or more)

      * Get all "short" books (books with 150 pages or less)

    ## Hint(s)

    * You may need to consult the [Sequelize Manual on Operators](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/model-querying-basics.html#operators) for the last two queries involving book pages.
    ```

### 5. Instructor Review: Sequelize Library (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ `findAll()`

    * ✔️ `where`

    * ✔️ `gte` and `lte`

* Open `01-Sequelize-Library/Solved/app/routes/api-routes.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 We use the `findAll()` method to retrieve all of the books from the `sequelize_library` database:

    ```js
    router.get('/books', (req, res) => {
      Book.findAll({}).then(results => {
        res.json(results);
      });
    });
    ```

    * 🔑 We use the `where` option to filter the query; for example, if we only want to get the books of a specific genre or author:

    ```js
    // Get all books of a specific genre
    router.get('/genres/:genre', (req, res) => {
      Book.findAll({
        where: {
          genre: req.params.genre 
        }
      }).then(results => {
        res.json(results);
      });
    });

    // Get all books from a specific author
    router.get('/authors/:author', (req, res) => {
      Book.findAll({
        where: {
          author: req.params.author
        }
      }).then(results => {
        res.json(results);
      });
    });
    ```

    * 🔑 We use Sequelize Operators, such as `gte` or `lte`, to make number comparisons. For example, if we want to get the books that have more or less than 150 pages:

    ```js
    // Get all "long" books (books 150 pages or more)
    router.get('/books/length/long', (req, res) => {
      Book.findAll({
        where: {
          pages: {
            [Op.gte]: 150
          }
        },
        order: [['pages', 'DESC']]
      }).then(results => {
        res.json(results);
      });
    });

    // Get all "short" books (books 150 pages or less)
    router.get('/books/length/short', (req, res) => {
      Book.findAll({
        where: {
          pages: {
            [Op.lte]: 150
          }
        },
        order: [['pages', 'ASC']]
      }).then(results => {
        res.json(results);
      });
    });
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What is Sequelize?

    * 🙋 An ORM designed for Node that lets users handle complex SQL database queries with JavaScript methods, rather than typing out SQL code.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [Sequelize Manual on Model Querying](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/model-querying-basics.html), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 6. Instructor Demo: Sequelize CRUD (5 min) 

* Be sure to have already created the `todolist` DB, run `npm install`, and modified the `connection.js` file to include your MySQL user/database information. Otherwise, walk through it with the class. 

* Navigate to `02-Sequelize-CRUD/Solved/` in your command line and run `npm start`. 

* Open the browser and go to `localhost:3001` to demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 Add a few new todos

    * 🔑 View the list of todos

    * 🔑 Edit a todo

    * 🔑 Delete a todo

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used CRUD methods in Lesson 1 when creating API routes for the User model.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 @TODO { YES, HOW? } 

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We need to use Sequelize CRUD methods in the appropriate routes.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 7. Student Do: Sequelize CRUD (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Sequelize-CRUD/README.md`.

    ```md
    # Sequelize CRUD

    In this activity, you will use Sequelize CRUD methods to create new todos, update and delete todos, and view all todos. 

    ## Instructions

    * Create a `'todolist'` DB.

    * Navigate to the [Unsolved](Unsolved/) folder and run `npm install` in your terminal.

    * Be sure to modify the [connection.js](Unsolved/app/config/connection.js) file to include your MySQL user/database information.

    * In the [api-routes.js](Unsolved/app/routes/api-routes.js) file, add the following Sequelize methods:

      * Add a Sequelize `findAll()` method inside the GET route which finds all of the todos and returns them to the user as JSON.

      * Add a Sequelize `create()` method inside the POST route to save a new todo to the database using the data in `req.body`.

      * Add a Sequelize `destroy()` method inside the DELETE route to delete the todo with the id from `req.params.id`.

      * Add a Sequelize `update()` method inside the PUT route to update a todo with the new todo data in `req.body`.

    * To test if this worked, open your terminal and run `npm start` and navigate to `localhost:3001` in your browser. If you are able to save new todos, as well as update and delete todos, you were successful.

    ## Hint(s)

    * You may need to read the Sequelize documentation on the [findAll()](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/class/lib/model.js~Model.html#static-method-findAll), [create()](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/class/lib/model.js~Model.html#static-method-create), [update()](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/class/lib/model.js~Model.html#static-method-update), [destroy()](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/class/lib/model.js~Model.html#static-method-destroy) methods, as well as [how to apply the "where" clause](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/model-querying-basics.html#applying-where-clauses).
    ```

### 8. Instructor Review: Sequelize CRUD (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ `findAll()`

    * ✔️ `create()`

    * ✔️ `destroy()`

    * ✔️ `update()`

* Open `02-Sequelize-CRUD/Solved/app/routes/api-routes.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 We use the Sequelize `findAll()` method inside the GET route which finds all of the todos and returns them to the user as JSON.

    ```js
    // GET route for getting all of the todos
    router.get('/api/todos', (req, res) => {
      Todo.findAll({}).then(dbTodo => {
        res.json(dbTodo);
      });
    });
    ```

    * 🔑 We use the Sequelize `create()` method inside the POST route to save a new todo to the database using the data in `req.body`.

    ```js
    // POST route for saving a new todo. We can create todo with the data in 'req.body'
    router.post('/api/todos', (req, res) => {
      Todo.create({
        text: req.body.text,
        complete: req.body.complete
      }).then(dbTodo => {
        res.json(dbTodo);
      });
    });
    ```

    * 🔑 We use the Sequelize `destroy()` method inside the DELETE route to delete the todo with the id from `req.params.id`.

    ```js
    // DELETE route for deleting a todo. We can get the id of the todo to be deleted from 'req.params.id'
    router.delete('/api/todos/:id', (req, res) => {
      Todo.destroy({
        where: {
          id: req.params.id
        }
      }).then(dbTodo => {
        res.json(dbTodo);
      });
    });
    ```
   
    * 🔑 We use the Sequelize `update()` method inside the PUT route to update a todo with the new todo data in `req.body`.

    ```js
    // PUT route for updating a todo. We can update todo with the data in req.body
    router.put('/api/todos/:id', (req, res) => {
      Todo.update(
        {
          text: req.body.text,
          complete: req.body.complete
        },
        {
          where: {
            id: req.params.id
          }
        }
      ).then(dbTodo => {
        res.json(dbTodo);
      });
    });
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ @TODO { DO WE END OUR REVIEWS WITH A QUESTION? }

    * 🙋 @TODO { YES, WE DO! }

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [Sequelize Model docs](https://sequelize.org/master/class/lib/model.js~Model.html), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

### 09. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

    * 🙋 We covered Sequelize query methods and CRUD methods.

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful. 

    * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

    * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer. 

    * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

    * 🙋 @TODO { YES, WHERE? }

    * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Use student answers to transition to Office Hours.


### 10. Office Hours (30 min)

* Announce Office Hours and invite students to stay on the Zoom and start the challenge while they have live support from instructional staff. 


### 11. End
