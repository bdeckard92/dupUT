## Class Instructions 

### 1. Introduction (5 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Direct students to post individual questions in the Zoom chat to be addressed by TAs and/or at the end of class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

    * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back and see what we accomplished, and acknowledge that it's a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic? 

    * 🙋 Let's do "fist to five" together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).


### 2. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* Students have now been introduced to ORMs and are getting deeper into working with MySQL, Node, and other technologies. There's a lot going on and it's easy for them to lose sight of what they're here for—for most students, that's a new career or a promotion. 

* For those that are here for a new job or a promotion into development, it's important that they keep moving forward on practicing for the interviewing as well as readying their application materials, which Career Services can help with.

* Last week they should have submitted their resume. Encourage students that have not yet done so to get that turned into a Profile Coach as soon as possible so they can receive feedback on it.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Why is it important to keep practicing algorithm solutions regularly?

    * 🙋 It's great interview practice and helps us learn new ways of solving problems using JavaScript.

* Use student answers to transition to the next activity. 

* Open your IDE and review the solution to the CodeSignal algorithm:

    * The algorithm is called 'checkPalindrome'. It should be a little easier to tackle than the last couple of weeks's algorithm challenges.

    * In this algorith challenge, you are given an `inputString`, and must check whether it is a palindrome and return a boolean value.

    > palindrome(/ˈpalənˌdrōm/) : a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., madam or nurses run.

    * For `inputString = "aabaa"`, the output should be `checkPalindrome(inputString) = true;`

    * For `inputString = "abac"`, the output should be `checkPalindrome(inputString) = false;`

    * For `inputString = "a"`, the output should be `checkPalindrome(inputString) = true`

    * The instructions provide the following details regarding input and output:

    ```
    [execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)

    [input] string inputString

    A non-empty string consisting of lowercase characters.

    Guaranteed constraints:
    1 ≤ inputString.length ≤ 105.

    [output] boolean

    true if inputString is a palindrome, false otherwise.
    ```

* We are also provided the following starter code:

```js
function checkPalindrome(inputString) {

}
```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝) and call on students for answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How do we tackle this problem logically? Or rather, how could we pseudocode it?

    * 🙋 First we'll want to reverse the `inputString`, and then check if it is the same as the original `inputString`

    * ☝️ Great! So if we take `inputString`, we'll need to execute three methods on it. First to split it into an array, then reverse it, and then join it back into a string. How can we do that?

    * 🙋 `let reversedString = inputString.split("").reverse().join("");

    * ☝️ Awesome. Now let's compare the two values and return true or false.

    * 🙋

    ```js
    if(reversedString === inputString) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
    ```

    * ☝️ This is a great use of an if-else statement. Can anybody think of a way to shorten it? There are a couple of options.
    
    Using a ternary expression:
    ```js
    return reversedString === inputString ? true : false;
    ```

    Shortening the entire function to just one line like this will return either a `true` or `false` value:
    ```js
    return inputString.split("").reverse().join("") === inputString;
    ```
    

* Full solution:
```js
function addOne(digits) {
    for (let i = digits.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        digits[i]++;
        if (digits[i] < 10 && digits[i] !== 0) return digits;
        digits[i] = 0;
        if (i === 0) {
            digits.unshift(1)
            return digits;
        }
    }
}
```
