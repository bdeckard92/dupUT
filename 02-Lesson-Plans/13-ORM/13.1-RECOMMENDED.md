# Module 13 Virtual Class (Recommended): Object-Relational Mapping

## Overview 

In today's recommended virtual class, students will { @TODO OUTLINE THE CAREER CONNECTION TOPIC }, as well as practice using Sequelize query methods and CRUD methods.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Solved the CodeSignal algorithm `checkPalindrome()`

* Utilize Sequelize query methods to retrieve data from the database

* Utilize Sequelize CRUD methods

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* Make sure you change all of the connection information so the examples have your MySQL username/password!

* If you don't want to do it live in class, create the databases required for today's exercises before class.

* BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO GO TOO IN DEPTH. There are a ton of components that make Sequelize work, but much of it is boilerplate that doesn't need much explanation. 

* THIS IS TOUGH STUFF! This week, tell your class to not feel discouraged if there are concepts that they can't nail down completely. Tell them to try their best, but to speak with you or a TA if they're unsure of anything.

* @TODO { REFERENCE TO ASYNC }

## Class Instructions 

### 1. Introduction (5 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Direct students to post individual questions in the Zoom chat to be addressed by TAs and/or at the end of class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

    * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back and see what we accomplished, and acknowledge that it's a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic? 

    * 🙋 Let's do "fist to five" together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).


### 2. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

### 2. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* [Click here for CodeSignal challenge](https://app.codesignal.com/public-test/zE2ktiq86xwEnMov2/bY2xgpYL4NGKoE) 


* Students have now been introduced to ORMs and are getting deeper into working with MySQL, Node, and other technologies. There's a lot going on and it's easy for them to lose sight of what they're here for—for most students, that's a new career or a promotion. 

* For those that are here for a new job or a promotion into development, it's important that they keep moving forward on practicing for the interviewing as well as readying their application materials, which Career Services can help with.

* Last week they should have submitted their resume. Encourage students that have not yet done so to get that turned into a Profile Coach as soon as possible so they can receive feedback on it.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Why is it important to keep practicing algorithm solutions regularly?

    * 🙋 It's great interview practice and helps us learn new ways of solving problems using JavaScript.

* Use student answers to transition to the next activity. 

* Open your IDE and review the solution to the CodeSignal algorithm:

    * The algorithm is called 'checkPalindrome'. It should be a little easier to tackle than the last couple of weeks's algorithm challenges.

    * In this algorith challenge, you are given an `inputString`, and must check whether it is a palindrome and return a boolean value.

    > palindrome(/ˈpalənˌdrōm/) : a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., madam or nurses run.

    * For `inputString = "aabaa"`, the output should be `checkPalindrome(inputString) = true;`

    * For `inputString = "abac"`, the output should be `checkPalindrome(inputString) = false;`

    * For `inputString = "a"`, the output should be `checkPalindrome(inputString) = true`

    * The instructions provide the following details regarding input and output:

    ```
    [execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)

    [input] string inputString

    A non-empty string consisting of lowercase characters.

    Guaranteed constraints:
    1 ≤ inputString.length ≤ 105.

    [output] boolean

    true if inputString is a palindrome, false otherwise.
    ```

* We are also provided the following starter code:

```js
function checkPalindrome(inputString) {

}
```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝) and call on students for answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How do we tackle this problem logically? Or rather, how could we pseudocode it?

    * 🙋 First we'll want to reverse the `inputString`, and then check if it is the same as the original `inputString`

    * ☝️ Great! So if we take `inputString`, we'll need to execute three methods on it. First to split it into an array, then reverse it, and then join it back into a string. How can we do that?

    * 🙋 `let reversedString = inputString.split("").reverse().join("");

    * ☝️ Awesome. Now let's compare the two values and return true or false.

    * 🙋

    ```js
    if(reversedString === inputString) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
    ```

    * ☝️ This is a great use of an if-else statement. Can anybody think of a way to shorten it? There are a couple of options.
    
    Using a ternary expression:
    ```js
    return reversedString === inputString ? true : false;
    ```

    Shortening the entire function to just one line like this will return either a `true` or `false` value:
    ```js
    return inputString.split("").reverse().join("") === inputString;
    ```
    

* Full solution:
```js
function addOne(digits) {
    for (let i = digits.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        digits[i]++;
        if (digits[i] < 10 && digits[i] !== 0) return digits;
        digits[i] = 0;
        if (i === 0) {
            digits.unshift(1)
            return digits;
        }
    }
}
```


### 3. Instructor Demo: Sequelize Library (5 min) 

* Be sure to have already created the `sequelize_library` database, run `npm install`, and modified the `connection.js` file to include your MySQL user/database information. Otherwise, walk through it with the class. 

* Navigate to `01-Sequelize-Library/Solved/` in your command line and run `npm start`. 

* Open the browser and go to `localhost:3001` to demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 Add a few books to the library

    * 🔑 Search for books by title, author, genre

    * 🔑 View all books

    * 🔑 View short or long books

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 @TODO { YES, WHERE? }

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We will need to use Sequelize to query the database.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We need to use Sequelize query methods to create the required routes. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 4. Student Do: Sequelize Library (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-Sequelize-Library/Unsolved/README.md`.

    ```md
    # Sequelize Library

    In this activity, you will use sequelize query methods to create the required routes.

    ## Instructions

    * Create a `'sequelize_library'` DB.

    * Navigate to the [Unsolved](Unsolved/) folder and run `npm install` in your terminal.

    * Be sure to modify the [connection.js](Unsolved/app/config/connection.js) file to include your MySQL user/database information.

    * In the [api-routes.js](Unsolved/app/routes/api-routes.js) file, modify the following routes to use sequelize query methods:

      * Get all books

      * Get all books of a specific genre

      * Get all books from a specific author

      * Get all "long" books (books with 150 pages or more)

      * Get all "short" books (books with 150 pages or less)

    ## Hint(s)

    * You may need to consult the [Sequelize Manual on Operators](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/model-querying-basics.html#operators) for the last two queries involving book pages.
    ```

### 5. Instructor Review: Sequelize Library (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ `findAll()`

    * ✔️ `where`

    * ✔️ `gte` and `lte`

* Open `01-Sequelize-Library/Solved/app/routes/api-routes.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 We use the `findAll()` method to retrieve all of the books from the `sequelize_library` database:

    ```js
    router.get('/books', (req, res) => {
      Book.findAll({}).then(results => {
        res.json(results);
      });
    });
    ```

    * 🔑 We use the `where` option to filter the query; for example, if we only want to get the books of a specific genre or author:

    ```js
    // Get all books of a specific genre
    router.get('/genres/:genre', (req, res) => {
      Book.findAll({
        where: {
          genre: req.params.genre 
        }
      }).then(results => {
        res.json(results);
      });
    });

    // Get all books from a specific author
    router.get('/authors/:author', (req, res) => {
      Book.findAll({
        where: {
          author: req.params.author
        }
      }).then(results => {
        res.json(results);
      });
    });
    ```

    * 🔑 We use Sequelize Operators, such as `gte` or `lte`, to make number comparisons. For example, if we want to get the books that have more or less than 150 pages:

    ```js
    // Get all "long" books (books 150 pages or more)
    router.get('/books/length/long', (req, res) => {
      Book.findAll({
        where: {
          pages: {
            [Op.gte]: 150
          }
        },
        order: [['pages', 'DESC']]
      }).then(results => {
        res.json(results);
      });
    });

    // Get all "short" books (books 150 pages or less)
    router.get('/books/length/short', (req, res) => {
      Book.findAll({
        where: {
          pages: {
            [Op.lte]: 150
          }
        },
        order: [['pages', 'ASC']]
      }).then(results => {
        res.json(results);
      });
    });
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What are some benefits of using an ORM, like Sequelize?

    * 🙋 The queries are written in plain JavaScript so there's no need to use complex SQL queries. Also ORMs usually have a single schema definition in the code. This makes it very clear what the schema is, and very simple to change it.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [Sequelize Manual on Model Querying](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/model-querying-basics.html), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 6. Instructor Demo: Sequelize CRUD (5 min) 

* Be sure to have already created the `todolist` DB, run `npm install`, and modified the `connection.js` file to include your MySQL user/database information. Otherwise, walk through it with the class. 

* Navigate to `02-Sequelize-CRUD/Solved/` in your command line and run `npm start`. 

* Open the browser and go to `localhost:3001` to demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 Add a few new todos

    * 🔑 View the list of todos

    * 🔑 Edit a todo

    * 🔑 Delete a todo

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 @TODO { YES, WHERE? }

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 @TODO { YES, HOW? } 

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We need to use Sequelize CRUD methods in the appropriate routes.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 7. Student Do: Sequelize CRUD (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Sequelize-CRUD/README.md`.

    ```md
    # Sequelize CRUD

    In this activity, you will use Sequelize CRUD methods to create new todos, update and delete todos, and view all todos. 

    ## Instructions

    * Create a `'todolist'` DB.

    * Navigate to the [Unsolved](Unsolved/) folder and run `npm install` in your terminal.

    * Be sure to modify the [connection.js](Unsolved/app/config/connection.js) file to include your MySQL user/database information.

    * In the [api-routes.js](Unsolved/app/routes/api-routes.js) file, add the following Sequelize methods:

      * Add a Sequelize `findAll()` method inside the GET route which finds all of the todos and returns them to the user as JSON.

      * Add a Sequelize `create()` method inside the POST route to save a new todo to the database using the data in `req.body`.

      * Add a Sequelize `destroy()` method inside the DELETE route to delete the todo with the id from `req.params.id`.

      * Add a Sequelize `update()` method inside the PUT route to update a todo with the new todo data in `req.body`.

    * To test if this worked, open your terminal and run `npm start` and navigate to `localhost:3001` in your browser. If you are able to save new todos, as well as update and delete todos, you were successful.

    ## Hint(s)

    * You may need to read the Sequelize documentation on the [findAll()](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/class/lib/model.js~Model.html#static-method-findAll), [create()](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/class/lib/model.js~Model.html#static-method-create), [update()](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/class/lib/model.js~Model.html#static-method-update), [destroy()](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/class/lib/model.js~Model.html#static-method-destroy) methods, as well as [how to apply the "where" clause](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/model-querying-basics.html#applying-where-clauses).
    ```

### 8. Instructor Review: Sequelize CRUD (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ `findAll()`

    * ✔️ `create()`

    * ✔️ `destroy()`

    * ✔️ `update()`

* Open `02-Sequelize-CRUD/Solved/app/routes/api-routes.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 We use the Sequelize `findAll()` method inside the GET route which finds all of the todos and returns them to the user as JSON.

    ```js
    // GET route for getting all of the todos
    router.get('/api/todos', (req, res) => {
      Todo.findAll({}).then(dbTodo => {
        res.json(dbTodo);
      });
    });
    ```

    * 🔑 We use the Sequelize `create()` method inside the POST route to save a new todo to the database using the data in `req.body`.

    ```js
    // POST route for saving a new todo. We can create todo with the data in 'req.body'
    router.post('/api/todos', (req, res) => {
      Todo.create({
        text: req.body.text,
        complete: req.body.complete
      }).then(dbTodo => {
        res.json(dbTodo);
      });
    });
    ```

    * 🔑 We use the Sequelize `destroy()` method inside the DELETE route to delete the todo with the id from `req.params.id`.

    ```js
    // DELETE route for deleting a todo. We can get the id of the todo to be deleted from 'req.params.id'
    router.delete('/api/todos/:id', (req, res) => {
      Todo.destroy({
        where: {
          id: req.params.id
        }
      }).then(dbTodo => {
        res.json(dbTodo);
      });
    });
    ```
   
    * 🔑 We use the Sequelize `update()` method inside the PUT route to update a todo with the new todo data in `req.body`.

    ```js
    // PUT route for updating a todo. We can update todo with the data in req.body
    router.put('/api/todos/:id', (req, res) => {
      Todo.update(
        {
          text: req.body.text,
          complete: req.body.complete
        },
        {
          where: {
            id: req.params.id
          }
        }
      ).then(dbTodo => {
        res.json(dbTodo);
      });
    });
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What is returned in the promise updating and deleting?

    * 🙋 Unlike the promise that is returned after creating and reading, this promise returns an array with the number of rows that were affected along with the affected rows themselves. 

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [Sequelize Model docs](https://sequelize.org/master/class/lib/model.js~Model.html), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 09. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

    * 🙋 We covered Sequelize query methods and CRUD methods.

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful. 

    * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

    * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer. 

    * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

    * 🙋 @TODO { YES, WHERE? }

    * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Use student answers to transition to Office Hours.


### 10. Office Hours (30 min)

* Announce Office Hours and invite students to stay on the Zoom and start the challenge while they have live support from instructional staff.
