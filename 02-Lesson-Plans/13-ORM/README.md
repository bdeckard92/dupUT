# Module 13 Instructor Overview: Object-Relational Mapping

## Overview

In this week's virtual classes, you'll review Sequelize query methods and CRUD methods

## Virtual Classes

[Recommended Class](./13.1-RECOMMENDED.md)

[Required Class](./13.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* If you don't want to do it live in class, create the databases required for the activities before class.

* BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO GO TOO IN DEPTH. There are a ton of components that make Sequelize work, but much of it is boilerplate that doesn't need much explanation. 

* THIS IS TOUGH STUFF! This week, tell your class to not feel discouraged if there are concepts that they can't nail down completely. Tell them to try their best, but to speak with you or a TA if they're unsure of anything.
