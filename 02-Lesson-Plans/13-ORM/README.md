# Module 13 Instructor Overview: ORM

## Overview

In this week's module, students learn about object-relational mapping (ORM), a technique that allows developers to convert data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming principles.

In this week's virtual classes, you'll review Sequelize query methods, CRUD methods, associations, and eager loading.

| Day | Topic             | Location   |
| --- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| 1   | Sequelize Library | 13.1       |
| 1   | Sequelize CRUD    | 13.1       |
| 2   | Blog CRUD         | 13.1       |
| 2   | Blog Association  | 13.3       |
| 2   | Blog Joins        | 13.4, 13.5 |

## Overview of Asynchronous Material

Why are students learning ORM?
You’ll work with Sequelize, an ORM library that creates a virtual object database that can be used within your code while managing a relational database. This will allow you to set up and completely manage objects using JavaScript, while Sequelize translates your code into database schema and queries using SQL.

* Students are learning ORM to become familiar with maintaining relational databases
* Learning ORM allows students to interface with different kinds of databases without needing to write complex queries
* ORMs allow students to work with data in plan JavaScript objects

Throughout the async module this week, students will use {MODULE TOPIC} to do the following:

**Reminder:** If students need help with an async activity, encourage them to attend Office Hours for help! If you can’t get through all of it, remind them that they can lean on Learning Assistants with the AskBCS bot for more help.

## Virtual Classes

If your class started AFTER January 1, 2021, use these lesson plans:

* [Virtual Class 13.1](./13.1-REQUIRED.md)

* [Virtual Class 13.2](./13.2-REQUIRED.md)

If your class started BEFORE January 1, 2021, use these lesson plans:

* [Virtual Class (Recommended) 13.1](./13.1-RECOMMENDED.md)

* [Virtual Class (Required) 13.2](./13.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* If you don't want to do it live in class, create the databases required for the activities before class.

* BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO GO TOO IN DEPTH. There are a ton of components that make Sequelize work, but much of it is boilerplate that doesn't need much explanation.

* THIS IS TOUGH STUFF! This week, tell your class to not feel discouraged if there are concepts that they can't nail down completely. Tell them to try their best, but to speak with you or a TA if they're unsure of anything.

* Remind students to complete the Midpoint Survey that covers their journey thus far. Clarify that this survey is **not** about the current Module, but is about the entire course up until this point! It’s important that they are aware of this in advance and that they take their time to complete the survey. This will ultimately help us understand how the program, the curriculum, the instruction, and our support can be improved!

### Common Pain Points

According to our class data, students might experience some of the following pain points throughout the week:

<!-- TODO FILL OUT CHART BY LISTING 2-4 PAIN POINTS AND SOLUTIONS -->

| Pain Point                          | Recommendation       |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| {COMMON PAIN POINT FOR THIS MODULE} | {RECOMMENDED ACTION} |
| {COMMON PAIN POINT FOR THIS MODULE} | {RECOMMENDED ACTION} |

## Career Connection

During each lesson that students work through, they will also view a Career Connection section that will tie together the academic content with Career Services and how this material will be applicable to them in their future career.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Director and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careerservicesonlineevents.splashthat.com/).

If you'd like more information on Career Services, visit the [Career Services resources page](https://mycareerspot.org/).

## Module Challenge

<!-- TODO WHAT WILL THE STUDENTS BUILD FOR THEIR HOMEWORK? -->

[Module 13 Challenge](../../01-Class-Content/13-ORM/02-Challenge)

Specific skills students will need to implement in order to be successful:

<!-- TODO LIST SKILLS THAT STUDENTS NEED TO COMPLETE THE CHALLENGE AND WHERE THEY LEARN THEM IN ASYNC CONTENT AT THE LESSON LEVEL (E.G., 1.3) -->

## Heads-Up

* Next week you will divide students into groups for their second project. Groups of three are ideal. Create one or two groups of four if the class cannot be divided by three. Structure groups so that their team members consist of students all at the same skill level.

* Next week you will review Handlebars, a template engine, as well as authentication.
