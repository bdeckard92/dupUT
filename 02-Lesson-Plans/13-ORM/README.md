# Module 13 Instructor Overview: Object-Relational Mapping

## Overview

In this week's virtual classes, you'll review Sequelize query methods, CRUD methods, associations, and eager loading.

## Virtual Classes

If your class started **AFTER** January 1, 2021, use these lesson plans:

* [Virtual Class 13.1](./13.1-REQUIRED.md)

* [Virtual Class 13.2](./13.2-REQUIRED.md)

If your class started **BEFORE** January 1, 2021, use these lesson plans:

* [Virtual Class (Recommended) 13.1](./13.1-RECOMMENDED.md)

* [Virtual Class (Required) 13.2](./13.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* If you don't want to do it live in class, create the databases required for the activities before class.

* BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO GO TOO IN DEPTH. There are a ton of components that make Sequelize work, but much of it is boilerplate that doesn't need much explanation. 

* THIS IS TOUGH STUFF! This week, tell your class to not feel discouraged if there are concepts that they can't nail down completely. Tell them to try their best, but to speak with you or a TA if they're unsure of anything.

* Remind students to complete the Midpoint Survey that covers their journey thus far. Clarify that this survey is **not** about the current Module, but is about the entire course up until this point! It’s important that they are aware of this in advance and that they take their time to complete the survey. This will ultimately help us understand how the program, the curriculum, the instruction, and our support can be improved!

## Career Connection

During each lesson that students work through, they will also view a Career Connection section that will tie together the academic content with Career Services and how this material will be applicable to them in their future career.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Director and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careerservicesonlineevents.splashthat.com/).

## Module Challenge

[Module 13 Challenge](../../01-Class-Content/13-ORM/02-Challenge)

## Heads Up

* Next week you will divide students into groups for their second project. Groups of three are ideal. Create one or two groups of four if the class cannot be divided by three. Structure groups so that their team members consist of students all at the same skill level.

* Next week you will review Handlebars, a template engine, as well as authentication.
