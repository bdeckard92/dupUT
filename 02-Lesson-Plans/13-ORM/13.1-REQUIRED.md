# Module 13 Virtual Class: Object Relational Mapping (ORM)

## Overview

In today's virtual class, students will practice using Sequelize query methods and CRUD methods. Students will also create relationships between models in one-to-one and one-to-many relationships.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Create and configure a Sequelize model

* Use Sequelize query methods to retrieve data from the database

* Perform create and read operations with Sequelize methods

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* In each activity, a sample `.env` file is provided named `.env.EXAMPLE`. Please be sure to rename this file from `.env.EXAMPLE` to `.env` before demonstrating any activities for the class.

* If you don't want to do it live in class, create the databases required for today's exercises before class.

* Avoid going too in depth. There are a ton of components that make Sequelize work, but much of it is boilerplate that doesn't need much explanation.

* This week, tell your class to not feel discouraged if there are concepts that they can't nail down completely. Tell them to try their best, and to speak with you or a TA if they're unsure of anything.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Invite students to post questions in the Zoom chat so TAs and/or the instructor can address them at the end of class.

* Open the lesson's [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xL-SnsKxCAa4gG4ehdOVlb--xz53AtkAbMdpFxkNkoQ/edit?usp=sharing) and walk through the following slides on foundation setting:

  **Big Picture**: This is an opportunity to look at the big picture of where students are in the course. Take a moment to discuss a few real-world examples of why this week's topics are valuable.

  **Boot Camp Pointers**: Review some logistics that will help students stay on track. This is an opportunity to speak to what students might need at this particular point in the course.

  **This Week**: Review the key skills students will be learning this week.

  **This Week's Assignment**: Give a quick summary of this week's Challenge assignment and describe how the skills they learn throughout the week will be applied to it.

  **Career Connection**: Reinforce that students will use the skills they learn this week throughout their careers. It's important for them to know the "why" and "how" behind the "what." Give examples of how these skills are used on the job. If you feel comfortable, share examples of how you have used them in your professional career.

  * Students have now been introduced to ORMs and are getting deeper into working with MySQL, Node.js, and other technologies. There's a lot going on and it might be easy to lose sight of what they're here for&mdash;for most students, that's a new career or a promotion.

  * For those students, it's important that they keep moving forward on interview practice and preparing their application materials, which Career Services can help with.

  * Last week, students should have submitted their resume. Encourage students who have not yet done so to send it to a Profile Coach as soon as possible so they can receive feedback on it.

  * Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Your resume is part of your employer-ready materials. What else makes up the required employer-ready materials?

    * 🙋 Resume, portfolio, and GitHub profile

    * ☝️ Just like with your resume, your portfolio and GitHub profile can be submitted to a Career Material Advisor (CMA) for feedback. Does anybody know what benefits you receive for having these pieces submitted to a CMA and then checked off as employer-ready by your Career Director?

    * 🙋 Completing these milestones makes you eligible for employer referral programs, industry events, and other Career Services resources.

  * Remind students that they can only access our referral programs and resources (beyond their Career Director) after they have submitted their resume, portfolio, and GitHub profile to a Career Director and it has been marked as employer-ready. Career Material Advisors can offer support in writing and developing those materials.

  * If students don't know who their Career Director is, remind them to check the emails they received from the Career Director starting in week 2, or they can check with their SSM.

  **How to Succeed This Week**: Remind students that they might experience moments of frustration as they learn complex concepts and tools, and that these times are actually proven opportunities to deepen knowledge. Consider sharing something about your personal learning journey. This helps students recognize that everyone starts somewhere and that they are not alone.

  **Today's Objectives**: Outline the concepts that will be covered in today's lesson. Remind students that they can find the relevant activity files in the "Getting Ready for Class" page in their course content.

### 2. Instructor Do: Student Check-In (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

  * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back at what we've accomplished and acknowledge that it is a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed&mdash;as long as you don’t give up.

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic?

  * 🙋 Let's do Fist to Five together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 3. Instructor Demo: Models (5 min)

* Before proceeding with the demo, please ensure that your `.env` credentials have been updated to reflect your local environment.

* Navigate to `01-Models/Solved/` in your command line and run the following command to source the schema for the `library_db` used in this activity:

```sh
mysql -u <your_user_name> -p < db/schema.sql
```

* Once the schema has been ran, run `npm install` and `npm start` to start the server and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 Sequelize executed a SQL CREATE TABLE statement when the `sync()` method was called.

  * 🔑 Sequelize performed this table creation based on the model defined in `models`.
  
  * Notice that the commands we ran are shown in terminal where our server is running.

* Open a mysql shell and run the following command:

  ```sh
  use library_db;
  describe book;
  ```

  * Notice that the output of the command reflects the structure of the `book` model. Sequelize will sync our database with the model we defined in `models` directory.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 In Lesson 1, we created API routes to `GET` all users and `GET` one user by `id`, as well as `CREATE` a new user.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

  * 🙋 We will need to use the MySQL to query the database and confirm what changes Sequalize makes to our database.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Models (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-Models/README.md`, which are also shown here:

  ```md
  # 🐛 MySQL Table Isn't Being Created to Specifications

  Work with a partner to resolve the following issues:

  * As a developer, I want a MySQL table with the same name as the Sequelize model.

  * As a developer, I want a more descriptive primary key name in the MySQL table.

  ## Expected Behavior

  When Sequelize syncs the model with the database, the table name should be `book` (singular) and the primary key name should be `book_id`.

  ## Actual Behavior

  The table name is `books`, and the primary key is `id`.

  ## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

  1. Run `npm start` from the command line to start the server and sync the database.

  2. Run `mysql -u root -p` to log into the MySQL shell.

  3. In the MySQL shell, run `USE library_db;` to switch to the library database.

  4. Try to run `DESCRIBE book;`. It will fail because the table name is `books`.

  5. Run `DESCRIBE books;`. Note that the primary key is named `id` and not `book_id`.

  ## 💡 Hints

  What options does Sequelize provide when it comes to naming tables and fields?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * How can you globally define table-naming rules for your Sequelize connection?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 5. Instructor Review: Models (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with Sequelize models? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ Sequelize column options

  * ✔️ Sequelize table options

* Open `01_Models/Solved/models/Book.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We added a `book_id` column with `primaryKey` and `autoIncrement` properties to replace Sequelize's auto-generated `id`, as follows:

    ```js
    book_id: {
      type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
      primaryKey: true,
      autoIncrement: true
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 In the configuration object, we added a `freezeTableName` property to prevent Sequelize from pluralizing the model name for the table name, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    {
      sequelize,
      timestamps: false,
      freezeTableName: true,
      underscored: true,
      modelName: 'book'
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why would we want to override Sequelize's default behavior?

  * 🙋 To remove any confusion around what we define and what Sequelize creates. For example, the names that we define won't suddenly change on us.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [Sequelize documentation on model basics](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/model-basics.html), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Create/Read (5 min)

* Before proceeding with the demo, please ensure that your `.env` credentials have been updated to reflect your local environment.

* Navigate to `02-Create-Read` and run `npm install` and `npm start` from the command line to demonstrate the following in Insomnia:

  * Create a new `POST` request to `http://localhost/api/books` to create a single book with the following JSON data:

  ```json
    {
      "book_id": 1,
      "title": "Don't Make Me Think",
      "author": "Steve Krug",
      "isbn": "1234",
      "pages": 400,
      "edition": 1,
      "is_paperback": true
  }
  ```

  * We can also make a `POST` request to `http://localhost/api/books/seed` to create multiple books at once.

  * 🔑 Notice the output in the terminal representing all of the raw queries that Sequelize is executing against our database.
  
  * Additionally, we can read back the results from our database by making a `GET` request to the `http://localhost/api/books` endpoint. You should see a response in Insomnia similar to the following snippet:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "book_id": 1,
      "title": "Don't Make Me Think",
      "author": "Steve Krug",
      "isbn": "1234",
      "pages": 400,
      "edition": 1,
      "is_paperback": true
    },
    {
      "book_id": 2,
      "title": "Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning",
      "author": "Peter Brown",
      "isbn": "978-0674729018",
      "pages": 336,
      "edition": 1,
      "is_paperback": false
    },
    {
      "book_id": 3,
      "title": "Essential Scrum: A Practical Guide to the Most Popular Agile Process",
      "author": "Kenneth Rubin",
      "isbn": "978-0137043293",
      "pages": 500,
      "edition": 1,
      "is_paperback": true
    },
  ]
  ```

  * Finally, we have an endpoint, `http:/localhost:3001/api/books/paperbacks` that will return a list of books where the `isPaperback` attribute is set to `true`.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We used create and read methods in our User model in Lesson 1 and in our Post model in Lesson 3.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

  * 🙋 We will need execute create and read methods on the products database.

  * ☝️ How would we query the database for only the paperbacks?

  * 🙋 We need to use optional parameters with appropriate Sequelize method in the `/paperbacks` route handler.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Create/Read (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Create-Read/README.md`, which are also shown here:

  ```md
  # 📐 Add Comments to Implementation of Sequelize Query Methods

  Work with a partner to add comments describing the functionality of the code found in [Unsolved](./Unsolved/routes/api/bookRoutes.js).

  ## 📝 Notes

  Refer to the documentation:

  [Sequelize documentation on model querying basics](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/model-querying-basics.html)

  ---

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What is the difference between Sequelize's `create()` and `build()` methods?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 8. Instructor Review: Create/Read (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with Sequelize queries? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ `findAll()`

  * ✔️ `findByPk()`

  * ✔️ Query parameters

* Open `02-Create-Read/Solved/routes/api/bookRoutes.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We use the `findAll()` method, as follows, to get all books from the database and send them as JSON in the response:

    ```js
    router.get('/', (req, res) => {
      Book.findAll().then((bookData) => {
        res.json(bookData);
      });
    });
    ```

  * 🔑 We add optional parameters to the `findAll()` method to specify a sort order, filter results with a `WHERE` clause, and exclude certain attributes from the results. See the following code for an example:
  
    ```js
    router.get('/paperbacks', (req, res) => {
      Book.findAll({
        // Order by title in ascending order
        order: ['title'],
        where: {
          // Only get books that have this boolean set to TRUE
          is_paperback: true
        },
        attributes: {
          // Don't include these fields in the returned data
          exclude: ['is_paperback', 'edition']
        }
      }).then((bookData) => {
        res.json(bookData);
      });
    });
    ```

  * 🔑 We use the `findByPk()` method to get a single record based on its `book_id` primary key, as follows:

    ```js
      router.get('/:id', (req, res) => {
      Book.findByPk(req.params.id).then((bookData) => {
        res.json(bookData);
      });
    });
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What is the plain SQL equivalent of `findAll()`?

  * 🙋 `SELECT * FROM book`

  * ☝️ What is the plain SQL equivalent of `findByPk()`?

  * 🙋 `SELECT * FROM book WHERE book_id = x`

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [Sequelize documentation on model querying basics](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/model-querying-basics.html), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

  * 🙋 We covered Sequelize query methods and CRUD methods.

  * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

  * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful.

  * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

  * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the Challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

  * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

  * 🙋 You can refer to Lesson 1 and 3.

  * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Use student answers to transition to Office Hours.

### 10. Challenge Review (30 min)

* Take this time to help get students unblocked on the current Challenge that they are working through.

* Expect that students may ask for the following:

  * Further review on a particular subject

  * Debugging assistance

  * Help with computer issues

  * Guidance with a particular tool
