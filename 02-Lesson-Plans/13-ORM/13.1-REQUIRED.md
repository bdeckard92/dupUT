# Module 13 Virtual Class: Object Relational Mapping (ORM)

## Overview 

In today's virtual class, students will practice using Sequelize query methods and CRUD methods.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Use Sequelize query methods to retrieve data from the database

* Use Sequelize CRUD methods

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* Make sure you change all of the connection information so the examples have your MySQL username/password.

* If you don't want to do it live in class, create the databases required for today's exercises before class.

* BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO GO TOO IN DEPTH. There are a ton of components that make Sequelize work, but much of it is boilerplate that doesn't need much explanation. 

* THIS IS TOUGH STUFF! This week, tell your class to not feel discouraged if there are concepts that they can't nail down completely. Tell them to try their best, and to speak with you or a TA if they're unsure of anything.

* Starting in Lesson 1, students created RESTful APIs for CRUD operations for the User model.

## Class Instructions 

### 1. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Invite students to post questions in the Zoom chat so TAs and/or the instructor can address them at the end of class.

* Open the lesson's [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xL-SnsKxCAa4gG4ehdOVlb--xz53AtkAbMdpFxkNkoQ/edit?usp=sharing) and walk through the following slides on foundation setting: 

  **Big Picture**: This is an opportunity to look at the big picture of where students are in the course. Take a moment to discuss a few real-world examples of why this week's topics are valuable.

  **Boot Camp Pointers**: Review some logistics that will help students stay on track. This is an opportunity to speak to what students might need at this particular point in the course. 

  **This Week**: Review the key skills students will be learning this week. 

  **This Week's Assignment**: Give a quick summary of this week's Challenge assignment and describe how the skills they learn throughout the week will be applied to it.

  **Career Connection**: Reinforce that students will use the skills they learn this week throughout their careers. It's important for them to know the "why" and "how" behind the "what." Give examples of how these skills are used on the job. If you feel comfortable, share examples of how you have used them in your professional career.

  * Students have now been introduced to ORMs and are getting deeper into working with MySQL, Node.js, and other technologies. There's a lot going on and it might be easy to lose sight of what they're here for&mdash;for most students, that's a new career or a promotion. 

  * For those students, it's important that they keep moving forward on interview practice and preparing their application materials, which Career Services can help with.

  * Last week, students should have submitted their resume. Encourage students who have not yet done so to send it to a Profile Coach as soon as possible so they can receive feedback on it.

  * Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Your resume is part of your employer-ready materials. What else makes up the required employer-ready materials?

    * 🙋 Resume, portfolio, and GitHub profile

    * ☝️ Just like with your resume, your portfolio and GitHub profile can be submitted to a Career Material Advisor (CMA) for feedback. Does anybody know what benefits you receive for having these pieces submitted to a CMA and then checked off as employer-ready by your Career Director?

    * 🙋 Completing these milestones makes you eligible for employer referral programs, industry events, and other Career Services resources.

  * Remind students that they can only access our referral programs and resources (beyond their Career Director) after they have submitted their resume, portfolio, and GitHub profile to a Career Director and it has been marked as employer-ready. Career Material Advisors can offer support in writing and developing those materials.
 
  * If students don't know who their Career Director is, remind them to check the emails they received from the Career Director starting in week 2, or they can check with their SSM. 

  **How to Succeed This Week**: Remind students that they might experience moments of frustration as they learn complex concepts and tools, and that these times are actually proven opportunities to deepen knowledge. Consider sharing something about your personal learning journey. This helps students recognize that everyone starts somewhere and that they are not alone.

  **Today's Objectives**: Outline the concepts that will be covered in today's lesson. Remind students that they can find the relevant activity files in the "Getting Ready for Class" page in their course content. 

### 2. Instructor Do: Student Check-In (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

  * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back at what we've accomplished and acknowledge that it is a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed&mdash;as long as you don’t give up.

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic?

  * 🙋 Let's do Fist to Five together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 3. Instructor Demo: Sequelize Library (5 min) 

* Be sure to have already created the `sequelize_library` database, run `npm install`, and modified the `connection.js` file to include your MySQL user/password information. Otherwise, walk through it with the class. 

* Navigate to `01-Sequelize-Library/Solved/` in your command line and run `npm start`. 

* Open the browser and go to <http://localhost:3001/> to demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 Add a few books to the library

    * 🔑 Search for books by title, author, genre

    * 🔑 View all books

    * 🔑 View short or long books

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 In Lesson 1, we created API routes to `GET` all users and `GET` one user by `id`, as well as `CREATE` a new user.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

    * 🙋 We will need to use Sequelize to query the database.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We need to use Sequelize query methods to create the required routes. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 4. Student Do: Sequelize Library (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-Sequelize-Library/README.md`, which are also shown here:

   ```md
   # Sequelize Library

   In this activity, you will use Sequelize query methods to create the required routes.

   ## Instructions

   * Create a `sequelize_library` DB.

   * Navigate to the [Unsolved](Unsolved/) folder and run `npm install` in your terminal.

   * Be sure to modify the [connection.js](Unsolved/app/config/connection.js) file to include your MySQL user/password information.

   * In the [api-routes.js](Unsolved/app/routes/api-routes.js) file, modify the following routes to use Sequelize query methods:

     * Get all books

     * Get all books of a specific genre

     * Get all books from a specific author

     * Get all "long" books (books with 150 pages or more)

     * Get all "short" books (books with 150 pages or less)

   ## Hint(s)

   * You may need to consult the [Sequelize Manual on Operators](https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/querying.html#operators) for the last two queries involving book pages.

   ## Bonus

   * Display the "long" books in descending order and the "short" books in ascending order.
   ```

### 5. Instructor Review: Sequelize Library (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points (:key:) below to review the following key points (✔️):

    * ✔️ `findAll()`

    * ✔️ `where`

    * ✔️ `gte` and `lte`

* Open `01-Sequelize-Library/Solved/app/routes/api-routes.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 We use the `findAll()` method to retrieve all of the books from the `sequelize_library` database:

       ```js
       router.get('/books', (req, res) => {
         Book.findAll({}).then(results => {
           res.json(results);
         });
       });
       ```

    * 🔑 We use the `where` option to filter the query; for example, if we only want to get the books of a specific genre or author:

       ```js
       // Get all books of a specific genre
       router.get('/genres/:genre', (req, res) => {
         Book.findAll({
           where: {
             genre: req.params.genre 
           }
         }).then(results => {
           res.json(results);
         });
       });

       // Get all books from a specific author
       router.get('/authors/:author', (req, res) => {
         Book.findAll({
           where: {
             author: req.params.author
           }
         }).then(results => {
           res.json(results);
         });
       });
       ```

    * 🔑 We use Sequelize Operators, such as `gte` or `lte`, to make number comparisons. For example, if we want to get the books that have more or less than 150 pages:

       ```js
       // Get all "long" books (books 150 pages or more)
       router.get('/books/length/long', (req, res) => {
         Book.findAll({
           where: {
             pages: {
               [Op.gte]: 150
             }
           },
           order: [['pages', 'DESC']]
         }).then(results => {
           res.json(results);
         });
       });

       // Get all "short" books (books 150 pages or less)
       router.get('/books/length/short', (req, res) => {
         Book.findAll({
           where: {
             pages: {
               [Op.lte]: 150
             }
           },
           order: [['pages', 'ASC']]
         }).then(results => {
           res.json(results);
         });
       });
       ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What are some benefits of using an ORM such as Sequelize?

    * 🙋 The queries are written in plain JavaScript so there's no need to use complex SQL queries. Also, ORMs usually have a single schema definition in the code. This makes it very clear what the schema is, and very simple to change it.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 1, read the [Sequelize Manual on Model Querying](https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/querying.html), and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Sequelize CRUD (5 min) 

* Be sure to have already created the `todolist` DB, run `npm install`, and modified the `connection.js` file to include your MySQL user/password information. Otherwise, walk through it with the class. 

* Navigate to `02-Sequelize-CRUD/Solved/` in your command line and run `npm start`. 

* Open the browser and go to <http://localhost:3001/> to demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 Add a few new todos

    * 🔑 View the list of todos

    * 🔑 Edit a todo

    * 🔑 Delete a todo

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used CRUD methods in our User model in Lesson 1 and in our Post model in Lesson 3.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

    * 🙋 We will need to use CRUD methods to query the products database.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We need to use Sequelize CRUD methods in the appropriate routes.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Sequelize CRUD (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Sequelize-CRUD/README.md`, which are also shown here:

     ```md
     # Sequelize CRUD

     In this activity, you will use Sequelize CRUD methods to create new todos, update and delete todos, and view all todos. 

     ## Instructions

     * Create a `todolist` DB.

     * Navigate to the [Unsolved](Unsolved/) folder and run `npm install` in your terminal.

     * Be sure to modify the [connection.js](Unsolved/config/connection.js) file to include your MySQL user/password information.

     * In the [api-routes.js](Unsolved/routes/api-routes.js) file, add the following Sequelize methods:

       * Add a Sequelize `findAll()` method inside the GET route which finds all of the todos and returns them to the user as JSON.

       * Add a Sequelize `create()` method inside the POST route to save a new todo to the database using the data in `req.body`.

       * Add a Sequelize `destroy()` method inside the DELETE route to delete the todo with the id from `req.params.id`.

       * Add a Sequelize `update()` method inside the PUT route to update a todo with the new todo data in `req.body`.

     * To test if this worked, open your terminal and run `npm start`. 

       * Navigate to <http://localhost:3001/> in your browser. 
    
       * If you are able to save new todos, as well as update and delete todos, you were successful.

     ## Hint(s)

     * You may need to read the Sequelize documentation on the [findAll()](https://sequelize.org/v5/class/lib/model.js~Model.html#static-method-findAll), [create()](https://sequelize.org/v5/class/lib/model.js~Model.html#static-method-create), [update()](https://sequelize.org/v5/class/lib/model.js~Model.html#static-method-update), [destroy()](https://sequelize.org/v5/class/lib/model.js~Model.html#static-method-destroy) methods, as well as [how to apply the "where" clause](https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/querying.html#where).
     ```

### 8. Instructor Review: Sequelize CRUD (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points (:key:) below to review the following key points (✔️):

    * ✔️ `findAll()`

    * ✔️ `create()`

    * ✔️ `destroy()`

    * ✔️ `update()`

* Open `02-Sequelize-CRUD/Solved/app/routes/api-routes.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 We use the Sequelize `findAll()` method inside the GET route which finds all of the todos and returns them to the user as JSON.

       ```js
       router.get('/api/todos', (req, res) => {
         Todo.findAll({}).then(dbTodo => {
           res.json(dbTodo);
         });
       });
       ```

    * 🔑 We use the Sequelize `create()` method inside the POST route to save a new todo to the database using the data in `req.body`.

       ```js
       router.post('/api/todos', (req, res) => {
         Todo.create({
           text: req.body.text,
           complete: req.body.complete
         }).then(dbTodo => {
           res.json(dbTodo);
         });
       });
       ```

    * 🔑 We use the Sequelize `destroy()` method inside the DELETE route to delete the todo with the id from `req.params.id`.

       ```js
       router.delete('/api/todos/:id', (req, res) => {
         Todo.destroy({
           where: {
             id: req.params.id
           }
         }).then(dbTodo => {
           res.json(dbTodo);
         });
       });
       ```
   
    * 🔑 We use the Sequelize `update()` method inside the PUT route to update a todo with the new todo data in `req.body`.

       ```js
       router.put('/api/todos/:id', (req, res) => {
         Todo.update(
           {
             text: req.body.text,
             complete: req.body.complete
           },
           {
             where: {
               id: req.params.id
             }
           }
         ).then(dbTodo => {
           res.json(dbTodo);
         });
       });
       ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What is returned in the Promise updating and deleting?

    * 🙋 Unlike the Promise that is returned after creating and reading, this Promise returns an array with the number of rows that were affected along with the affected rows themselves. 

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lessons 1 and 3, read the [Sequelize Model docs](https://sequelize.org/v5/class/lib/model.js~Model.html), and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

    * 🙋 We covered Sequelize query methods and CRUD methods.

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful. 

    * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

    * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the Challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer. 

    * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

    * 🙋 You can refer to Lesson 1 and 3.

    * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Use student answers to transition to Office Hours.

### 10. Challenge Review (30 min)

* Take this time to help get students unblocked on the current Challenge that they are working through.

* Expect that students may ask for the following:

  * Further review on a particular subject

  * Debugging assistance

  * Help with computer issues

  * Guidance with a particular tool

### 11. End
