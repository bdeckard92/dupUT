# Lesson Plans Overview

## Instructor Notes

Each module contains an overview (like this one!) that contains tips, alerts, and resources to help you prepare. The following are general guidelines to be applied to all modules:

- When reviewing activities, ask for volunteers to share their solutions and/or ask students to walk through the solution line-by-line.

- If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

- If you are comfortable doing so, share your struggle and/or personal experiences learning and working with the concepts covered in this lesson.

- During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

- While students are working on activities, you may want to present this [Time to Code slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fUrXBMNng_r8NFkm2aGeO5yy4Eo_OQe0RpNjb2Iqqd4/edit?usp=sharing) to provide clarification for students accessing the class recording later.

- In the second virtual class each week, you will need to demonstrate the upcoming challenge. Make sure to familiarize yourself with the application and ensure any dependencies are installed prior to class.

## Virtual Class Lesson Plans

The virtual classes are scheduled video class times held on either a Monday/Wednesday or Tuesday/Thursday schedule. These classes are led by one instructor and supported by assigned instructional staff members. If you are not sure which class you are leading, please confirm with your Student Success Manager or Online Instructional Lead.

All virtual classes are held on video calls and automatically recorded to be made available to learners for review.

Only learners who are assigned to that specific class may attend these classes.

### Emoji Key

### Time Trackers

### Virtual Class 1

The first virtual class is held on a Monday or Tuesday, depending on your specific class schedule (please ask your Student Success Manager or Online Instructional Lead if you are not sure which schedule to use). These classes are loosely structured with lesson plans that are meant to be flexible so you can adjust them to meet the specific needs of your class.

Your class should have already begun reviewing their ascynchronous material and learning independently. They should come to class prepared to ask questions that will deepen their preliminary understanding of the material. Students are expected to be in the middle of working on their asynchronous content during this time of the week.


### Virtual Class 2

The second virtual class is held on a Wednesday or Thursday, depending on your specific class schedule (please ask your Student Success Manager or Online Instructional Lead if you are not sure which schedule to use). These classes are completely structured with lesson plans tailored to deepen the critical understanding of the independent learning that has been done throughout the week.

By the time this class meets, your class should be nearly done with their asynchronous material and should be working on their Challenge.
