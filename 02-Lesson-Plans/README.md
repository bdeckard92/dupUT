# Lesson Plans Overview

## Instructor Notes

Each module contains an overview (like this one!) with **Instructor Notes** containing tips, alerts, and resources to aid you in preparation. The following are general guidelines to be applied to all modules:

- When reviewing activities, ask for volunteers to share their solutions and/or ask students to walk through the solution, line-by-line.

- If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

- If you are comfortable doing so, share your struggle and/or personal experiences learning and working with the concepts covered in this lesson.

- During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

- In Required sessions, you will need to demonstrate the upcoming challenge. You will want to familiarize yourself with the application and ensure any dependencies are installed prior to class.

### Emoji Key

Lesson plans use emojis for visual cues. 

| Emoji     | Significance          |
| ---       | ---                   |
| ‚úîÔ∏è         | The checklist of concepts to be addressed in a review; corresponds with the `:key:` emoji (see below) |
| üîë        | The key concepts to be introduced in a demo or covered in a review (corresponds with the `:heavy-check-mark:` emoji (see above)|
| ‚òùÔ∏è           | A question for _you_ to ask             |
| üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è        | A potential answer to solicit from students |

### Time Trackers

Recommended and Required sessions follow the same format week-to-week.

### Recommended Sessions

Recommended Sessions are two hour Zoom sessions held earlier in the week (Mondays/Tuesdays) and are optional for students. Students are expected to be in the middle of working on their asynchronous content during this time of the week.

The primary goals of Recommended Sessions are to:

- Build community and help students feel more connected to instructors and one another

- Help students who are ‚Äústuck‚Äù on the asynchronous work and would appreciate extra guidance and support

- Provide extra context in the learning journey around career preparation and workforce readiness


#### Determine Group Sentiment

‚úä Recommended sessions begin with an activity to get the pulse of the class. The lesson plans use "Fist-to-Five", in which students hold up a hand indiciating their comfort level with the material, where a fist indicates lack of confidence (0) and an open hand indicates full confidence (5). Feel free to use other means to gauge overall comprehension of the material.


#### Career Connection

After getting the pulse of the class, the longest, and perhaps most important, activity of a Recommended session is the Career Connection. These will primarily be preparation for technical interviews and will reinforce topics introduced in the corresponding asynchronous Career Connection. You are encouraged to share your own experiences in these activities.


### Required Sessions

The Live Classes of our online boot camps are the only moments of the week in which learners are _required_ to be face-to-face with instructors, TAs, and one another. For busy learners or those who are not attending the optional sessions, these may be the only moment of social learning of the week, period. Learners are likely to see this live class as the ‚Äúanchor‚Äù of their bootcamp, and they will want each live class to feel enriching, meaningful, and worth their attendance. Live Classes are the ‚Äòpivot point‚Äô in which students are shifting focus from primarily doing asynchronous content to starting the weekly Challenge. 

#### Ice Breaking Introduction

The first activity of thhe required session, (Introduction), is intended to be an icebreaker. Students will have spent many hours alone this week, working through asynchronous lesson plans. Some will have been moving confidently and feeling great; others will have been struggling or feeling overwhelmed. This is a moment for students to connect with others, receive empathy and emotional support for their experiences, and get geared up for a positive class, no matter what their week was like and no matter how much of their content they have completed.
