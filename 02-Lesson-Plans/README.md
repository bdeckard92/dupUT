# Lesson Plans Overview

## Instructor Notes

Each module contains an overview (like this one!) with `Instructor Notes` containing tips, alerts, and resources to aid you in preparation. The following are general guidelines to be applied to all modules:

* When reviewing activities, ask for volunteers to share their solutions and/or ask students to walk through the solution, line-by-line.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, share your struggle and/or personal experiences learning and working with the concepts covered in this lesson.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* In Required sessions, you will need to demonstrate the upcoming challenge. You will want to familiarize yourself with the application and ensure any dependencies are installed prior to class.

### Flex Sessions

Flex Sessions are two hour Zoom sessions held earlier in the week (Mondays/Tuesdays) and are optional for students. Students are expected to be in the middle of working on their asynchronous content during this time of the week. 

The primary goals of Flex Sessions are to:

* Build community and help students feel more connected to instructors and one another

* Help students who are “stuck” on the asynchronous work and would appreciate extra guidance and support

* Provide extra context in the learning journey around career preparation and workforce readiness
