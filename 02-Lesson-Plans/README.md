# Lesson Plans Overview

## Instructor Notes

Each module contains an overview (like this one!) with **Instructor Notes** containing tips, alerts, and resources to aid you in preparation. The following are general guidelines to be applied to all modules:

- When reviewing activities, ask for volunteers to share their solutions and/or ask students to walk through the solution, line-by-line.

- If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

- If you are comfortable doing so, share your struggle and/or personal experiences learning and working with the concepts covered in this lesson.

- During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

- In Required sessions, you will need to demonstrate the upcoming challenge. You will want to familiarize yourself with the application and ensure any dependencies are installed prior to class.

## Virtual Class Lesson Plans

Virtual Class (Recommended) and Virtual Class (Required) Sessions are scheduled video class times held on either a Monday/Wednesday or Tuesday/Thursday schedule. These sessions are led by one Instructor and supported by assigned Instructional Staff Members. If you are unsure of which class you are leading, please confirm with your Program Support Manager or Online Instructional Lead.

All Virtual Class Sessions are held on video calls and are automatically recorded to be made available to learners for review.

Only learners who are assigned to that specific class may attend these sessions.

### Virtual Class: Recommended Sessions

A Virtual Class (Recommended) Session is held on a Monday or Tuesday, depending on your specific class schedule (Please ask your Program Support Manager or Online Instructional Lead if you are not sure which schedule to use). These sessions are loosely structured with Lesson Plans that are meant to be flexible in order to be adjusted as needed with the specific needs of your class in mind.

Your class should have already begun reviewing their ascynchronous material and learning independently. They should come to Virtual Class (Recommended) Sessions prepared to ask questions that will deepen their preliminary understanding of the material.

Recommended Sessions are two hour Zoom sessions held earlier in the week (Mondays/Tuesdays) and are optional for students. Students are expected to be in the middle of working on their asynchronous content during this time of the week.

The primary goals of Recommended Sessions are to:

- Build community and help students feel more connected to instructors and one another

- Help students who are ‚Äústuck‚Äù on the asynchronous work and would appreciate extra guidance and support

- Provide extra context in the learning journey around career preparation and workforce readiness


#### Determine Group Sentiment

‚úä Recommended sessions begin with an activity to get the pulse of the class. The lesson plans use "Fist-to-Five", in which students hold up a hand indiciating their comfort level with the material, where a fist indicates lack of confidence (0) and an open hand indicates full confidence (5). Feel free to use other means to gauge overall comprehension of the material.


#### Career Connection

After getting the pulse of the class, the longest, and perhaps most important, activity of a Recommended session is the Career Connection. These will primarily be preparation for technical interviews and will reinforce topics introduced in the corresponding asynchronous Career Connection. You are encouraged to share your own experiences in these activities.


### Virtual Class: Required Sessions

A Virtual Class (Required) Session is held on a Wednesday or Thursday, depending on your specific class schedule (Please ask your Program Support Manager or Online Instructional Lead if you are not sure which schedule to use). These sessions are completely structured with Lesson Plans tailored to deepen the critical understanding of the independent learning that has been done throughout the week.

Your class should be nearly complete with their asynchronous material and should be working on their Challenge Assignment.

There is a 30-minute period alotted before and after each of these sessions meant to be used for open Office Hours for further flexibility.

The Live Classes of our online boot camps are the only moments of the week in which learners are _required_ to be face-to-face with instructors, TAs, and one another. For busy learners or those who are not attending the optional sessions, these may be the only moment of social learning of the week, period. Learners are likely to see this live class as the ‚Äúanchor‚Äù of their bootcamp, and they will want each live class to feel enriching, meaningful, and worth their attendance. Live Classes are the ‚Äòpivot point‚Äô in which students are shifting focus from primarily doing asynchronous content to starting the weekly Challenge. 

#### Ice Breaking Introduction

The first activity of thhe required session, (Introduction), is intended to be an icebreaker. Students will have spent many hours alone this week, working through asynchronous lesson plans. Some will have been moving confidently and feeling great; others will have been struggling or feeling overwhelmed. This is a moment for students to connect with others, receive empathy and emotional support for their experiences, and get geared up for a positive class, no matter what their week was like and no matter how much of their content they have completed.


### Running Office Hours

There are 2 different situations during which Office Hours would be run: 

* **Instructor-led** Office Hours before and after video classes, supported by other Instructional Staff. 
* **Supplemental** Office Hours during the week, led by a single Instructional Staff Member, hours assigned by management. 

Office Hours are designed to help students get caught up with their weekly work, feel more confident with the concepts they‚Äôve covered, and grant them an opportunity to get all their questions answered. Office Hours tend to circle around the idea of providing students repetition of concepts they would have seen previously, potentially in their asynchronous course material, but with a deep dive aspect for building further clarity and understanding. 

Most importantly, Office Hours are **student-driven**. Let your students tell you what they need. You can provide an initial structure, but if you sense that your students need something else or they are demonstrating that they need something different than what you had originally planned, or what is outlined in the curriculum guidance provided, please feel empowered to pivot as needed. As the leader of Office Hours sessions, know that you can make the call to shift focus according to your students‚Äô needs.

**For Instructor-led Office Hours**, you do not need to post anything specific. Because this is tied to a specific class session, only students from your class should attend. 

**For Supplemental Office Hours** led by a single Instructional Staff Member, post a message on #general in Slack letting students know that you‚Äôre about to get online with a Zoom link and the time you will remain online. These sessions are available to every student in the cohort.

```
#general: 

@channel Hey, everyone! It's time for Office Hours! 
I'll be online for 2 hours: https://zoom.us/j/yy67xx4zz1
```

## Engagement Tactics

### How do you Maintain Engagement Online?

These Virtual Class sessions are meant to be collaborative and engaging. Your students should be encouraged to participate heavily and drive the discussion forward. If this is not happening naturally, use some of the following techniques to encourage this:

* Welcome students by name when they come in
* Call on students to explain blocks of code to the class
* Ask students to raise their hand if they believe the code will produce a certain outcome when run
* Ask students to rate their understanding of a concept from 0 to 5 using their hands
* When live coding, incorporate student suggestions into the code, like their names, names of their pets, cities where they grew up, etc.
* Last, but certainly not least, create a safe space for students through encouragement, repetition of basics, and opportunities for them to practice and succeed.
* Get students to share their screens when they have an issue to work through - pair programming is a great skill to teach them

### How do you Pivot Based on Student Needs?

These sessions should be altered as needed for your particular audience. The purpose of these sessions is to help students solidify information, but if what we have isn't working, pivoting is the name of the game! You might get students that are more familiar with some of the concepts being covered, so make sure that you're reading your audience for their level of understanding, level of engagement, and whether or not we have a consensus on "I've got this - let's move on."

*Remember*: You are completely empowered as the leader of these sessions to alter them as would best suit you and your audience at that time.

### Reading your Students:

One particularly important thing is to take all of your audience into account in your decisions. You might have one vocal student speaking for the group, but you may have a couple of shy people who won't want to admit that they're still in need of more remediation.

#### Here are some ideas for getting to know how your students are feeling:

1. Ask your students to rate how comfortable they feel on a topic from **"Fist" to "Five"**. A Fist (0) means they are not feeling comfortable at all. An open hand (5) means that they feel very confident in their mastery of the subject.
2. If you feel like you have shyer students in there who wouldn't want to admit that they are falling behind and still need you to cover the material, ask people to send you a **private Slack message**.
3. **Use cold calling** as often as you feel comfortable. Students should be participating heavily on these calls, so call on people to help guide you through lines of code, tell you how things work, or give a definition about a concept before you cover it. This helps you assess how much one particular student knows, while reinforcing everyone else's knowledge through repetition. Just remember to keep it a safe space and be encouraging, even if they're wrong.
4. **Have students use "Life Lines".** If they get called on and don't know the answer, they can then pass it onto another student. If the question gets passed to multiple students who don't know, you have your gauge of understanding there and know where to focus more of your time.
5. Consider using a [Zoom Poll](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/213756303-Polling-for-Meetings#h_fe37b3f4-8e05-4b87-bd66-12d8c7f19ff8) to give an **anonymous Zoom survey** where students can rate where their level of comfort is with concepts. It's your choice as to whether or not you share the general results with the class.

### How to Pivot

So let's talk about what to do if your audience isn't really feeling the current session content and they aren‚Äôt providing any feedback about what else they might want.

### If the students need more remediation‚Ä¶

First things first: *Slow down*.

If your students are getting lost in your review of the material, they might have a lower level of mastery than anticipated. They may have missed classes, rushed through the asynchronous material, or failed to review the content before coming to your session. Or they may just have fundamental misunderstandings of core concepts!

#### If this is the majority of the class:

1. Slow down completely and reiterate over concepts multiple times.
2. Use a drill-like demonstration approach. If we're covering loops and people are very confused, you might want to write out a few examples of loops so they get used to seeing the syntax, for example. 
3. You can use class participation to expand on the drills and write enough loops to where they realize they tend to be very similar, with small interchangeable pieces.
4. Check in with students frequently for understanding using a Fist to Five check in.

#### If there are only a couple of students needing more remediation in the class:

1. Still take a slowed down approach, to an extent.
2. You'll want to continue moving forward, but not without taking the time to repeat yourself various times.
3. Did you already cover the definition of a loop? Do it again! Did you already show one example of a loop? Try one more! Any time you see an opportunity to repeat a definition, use case, or a pesky bug that pops up frequently, take it! Repetition is a huge part of learning for a lot of people and the more times they hear you say something, the easier it will become for them to make that a lasting memory.
4. Check in with students frequently for understanding using a Fist to Five check in.

### If the students are more advanced...

If you sense that some students are bored and already know all the concepts you're covering, that's great news! That means that they've been absorbing everything in class, they've been reviewing recordings, keeping up to date on their async modules, and re-doing activities like we've asked them to! But we can make sure that these sessions are still compelling for the more advanced students of the bunch.

#### If this is the majority of the class:

1. You can still hit every activity and discussion point, but take opportunities to test their skills and push them to learn more.
2. Talk about interesting use cases or specific instances in which a particular tool or technology wouldn't work and what the alternative would be.
3. You can ask them to try and refactor the original activity solution for something more efficient. They can talk about the options aloud. This course will be a lot of self-guided learning, which means that if you even just show them the documentation for a `.forEach()` in relation to how to create a more efficient loop-type approach, that gets their brains working on a pattern of finding efficiencies, for example.
4. Repeat the fundamentals for the more remedial students before you move on.

#### If there are only a couple of advanced students in the class:

1. You can still do the above, but keep it more limited to just showing documentation.
2. Ask your more advanced students to work on revamping the solution code to these reviews, their challenge assignments, or in-class activities using new tooling instead of diving into it personally with them.
3. When applicable, teach one other way of solving a problem that is typically more complex or efficient.
4. When applicable, talk about alternative technologies that the students can dive into when they want to expand their knowledge.
5. If this isn‚Äôt during Office Hours, encourage students to come back for these more open-flow sessions that allow for deeper dives.
