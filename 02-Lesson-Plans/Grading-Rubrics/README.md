# How Does Grading Work? 

Running a Blended model class takes a lot of moving pieces, so we rely on streamlined teamwork to keep everything working for our learners!

### Who Handles the Grading? 
Grading is handled by our Centralized Grading team to help take some pressure off of the in-class Instructional Staff. 

By using our Centralized Grading team, we are able to streamline and standardize our assignment evaluations across multiple cohorts for consistent data. We can also free up our in-class Instructional Staff to use some hands-on teaching opportunities in helping our learners reach their educational goals. 


### What if a Learner Wants to Dispute a Grade? 
If a learner disagrees with their grade, they can reach out to their Instructional Staff and Program Support Manager for assistance.

Instructional Staff should review the grade and commentary left behind by the Centralized Grader within the asynchronous platform and compare this to the submitted assignment as well as the provided curriculum rubric. Instructional Staff are able to adjust grades as needed, based on their findings. 


### What if Learners Want to Submit Late Assignments? 
Learners are capable of submitting late assignments through their asynchronous platform. They can also resubmit assignments after the deadline. Please remain vigilant for instances of plagiarism, particularly after the assignment deadline, as solutions are posted for learners. 

Late assignments currently carry no penalty. 


### What do the Different Grade Colors Mean? 
You may have noticed that a row of grades for a learner is color-coded. 

* **White** - On-time assignment submission
* **Blue** - Late assignment submission
* **Orange** - Excused assignment submission

**Note**: Please note that all `Excused` assignments are tagged as `Late` automatically in the learner’s view. The image below depicts the following Status selections in order: `Late`, `None`, `Excused`, `Excused`, `Late`. 


### How do I Remove a Late Tag from an Assignment Submission?
If an assignment was resubmitted after the deadline, it will be automatically assigned a `Late` status. Although late assignments currently carry no penalty against learners, staff can adjust this tag if necessary. 

Click on the dropdown arrow by a grade. Select the option of `None` under Status. 


### What does the Excused Assignment Status Mean? 
Please refrain from using the `Excused` Status on grades as it may have an impact on the graduation verification system for learners. Discuss any need to excuse assignments with your Program Support Manager. 

Note: Please note that all `Excused` assignments are tagged as `Late` automatically in the learner’s view. The image below depicts the following Status selections in order: `Late`, `None`, `Late`, `None`, `None`.


### What does the Dropped Status mean? 
The 2 lowest scores for each learner are dropped from their average. The assignments that are slated to be dropped are dynamic based on learner submissions and are identifiable by the `Dropped` notation above their grade. 


### What if I Suspect Plagiarism? 
Our organization and our university partnerships take plagiarism seriously. If you suspect an assignment contains plagiarism, please contact the Program Support Manager for proper escalation of the issue.
