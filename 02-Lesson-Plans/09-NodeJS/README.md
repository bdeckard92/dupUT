# Module 09 Instructor Overview: Node.js

## Overview

In this module, students will learn how to use the Node.js platform to use JavaScript outside of the browser. Students will use the `fs` module to read and write files, and gather input using the Inquirer npm package.

In this week's virtual classes, you'll review the `fs` and Inquirer packages. You'll also cover ES6 features, including arrow functions, functional loops, and object destructuring.

The following table maps the key topics covered in the virtual lessons to where they are taught in the asynchronous content:

| Day | Topic                    | Location      |
| --- | ------------------------ | ------------- |
| 1   | Arrow functions          | 9.1 - 9.2     |
| 1   | Inquirer                 | 9.3 - 9.5     |
| 1   | Git Guide                | N/A           |
| 2   | `fs` module              | 9.2           |
| 2   | Functional loops         | 9.4           |
| 2   | Destructuring assignment | 9.4           |

## Overview of Asynchronous Material

This week in the asynchronous content, students are introduced to Node.js. Node.js is important for the following reasons:

* Node.js helps us build interactive web applications, and allows us to use JavaScript for both client-side and server-side functionality.

* Node.js offers a rich package ecosystem and easy access to a multitude of libraries and tools, including Express.js.

* Node.js is a sought-after development skill and is widely used at both large and small companies.

Throughout the async module this week, students will use Node.js to do the following:

* Build interactive command-line applications that process user input.

* Explain modularization and how it relates to npm and the standard Node.js library.

* Initialize new Node.js projects using npm, and install and import dependencies.

* Explain the importance and usefulness of ES6+ concepts such as `let`, `const`, and arrow functions.

* Handle asynchronicity using callbacks and Promises.

**Reminder**: If students need help with an async activity, encourage them to attend Office Hours. If they need more help, remind them that they can use Learning Assistants via the AskBCS bot.

The following table contains a description of each lesson's portion of the module project and the corresponding key points that are taught:

## Virtual Classes

Here are the lesson plans for this week's virtual classes:

* [09.1 Virtual Class](./09.1-REQUIRED.md)

* [09.2 Virtual Class](./09.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* The transition from client-side development to Node.js can be challenging for students.

* If students question why they're learning Node.js, emphasize its role in the client-server model. Full-stack developers must be able to build applications using the client-server model. They'll likely face interview questions about the difference between the client and the server and how they relate to each other.

* Students will be expected to have Node.js installed. If they don't, remind them that they can install it using the resources found in the [Node.js installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/nodejs/how-to-install-nodejs).

* This module also introduces the npm package, Inquirer. Refer to the [npm documentation on Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) for installation, examples, and more information on the methods used.

### Common Pain Points

According to our class data, students might experience some of the following pain points throughout the week:

| Pain Point                          | Recommendation       |
| ---                                 | ---                  |
| Arrow functions                     | Refer to Lesson 1 and 2 or the [MDN Web Docs on arrow function expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions).  |
| Object destructuring                | Refer to Lesson 4 or the [MDN Web Docs on destructuring assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment). |

## Career Connection

The first virtual class of the week contains a Career Connection section, which links the current module's coursework with career services and students' future careers. During this section, it can be helpful to share examples of how you've used these skills and tools in your professional life.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Coach and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp).

If you'd like more information on career services, visit the [career services resources page](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp).

## Module Challenge

For the [Module 09 Challenge](../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/02-Challenge), students will use starter code to build a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input, using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). For more help, refer students to [The Full-Stack Blog guide to a professional README file](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide).

Students must know how to implement the following skills in order to succeed in this week's Challenge:

* Modularize code into multiple files.

* Write code using ES6+ concepts like `let`, `const`, and arrow functions.

* Initialize a project and install and import Node.js modules using npm.

* Build an interactive command-line application that processes user input using a third-party Node.js module.

* Dynamically generate Markdown from the command line using string literals.

## Heads-Up

* Next week, you'll introduce object-oriented programming (OOP). You'll cover test-driven development (TDD), ES6 classes, and using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for mocking and testing.

* Warn students that the next module is very concept-heavy! Object-oriented programming can be difficult at first, but understanding it is crucial in becoming employer-competitive. Although writing tests before code might feel counterintuitive, this approach can help developers plan and break down their apps into more manageable chunks. Reassure students that they aren't alone in struggling with this topic; it's perfectly normal to feel a little lost at first.

* Likewise, don't feel discouraged if your students don't immediately understand object-oriented programming, even after you've tried to explain it. It takes time to fully grasp the concept, so keep encouraging your students and reassuring them that they'll understand it with time and practice! If you're comfortable doing so, share your own experiences or struggles learning and working with OOP.
