# Module 09 Instructor Overview: Node.js

## Overview

In this module, students will learn how to use the Node.js platform to use JavaScript outside of the browser. Students will use the `fs` module to read and write files and gather input using the `inquirer` npm package.

In this week's virtual classes, you'll review the `fs` and `inquirer` packages, as well as ES6 features, like arrow functions, functional loops, and object destructuring.

| Day | Topic                    | Location      |
| --- | ------------------------ | ------------- |
| 1   | Arrow Functions          | 9.1, 9.2      |
| 1   | Inquirer                 | 9.3. 9.4, 9.5 |
| 2   | `fs` Module              | 9.2           |
| 2   | Functional Loops         | 9.1           |
| 2   | Destructuring Assignment | 9.4           |

## Overview of Asynchronous Material

Why are students learning Node.js?

* To use JavaScript outside of the browser
* To manipulate the file system using the `fs` module
* To make use of open source `npm` packages in their projects
* To set them up for success when creating web servers in the future

Throughout the async module this week, students will use Node.js to do the following:

* Identify the purpose Node.js serves in modern web development and when to use it.
* Create and execute a Node.js application from the command line.
* Outline the differences between the JavaScript syntax we've used and the new ES6 features in order to understand the purpose they serve in JavaScript.
* Execute a Node.js application that accepts arguments from the command line in order to display different results based on those arguments.
* Understand the purpose of npm and navigate its ecosystem.
* Learn npm commands to initiate projects and install packages using the command-line utility.
* Learn how to work with data more efficiently, using new JavaScript features and array methods.
* Use Node.js’s modularity to keep the functionality clean and easy to read.

**Reminder:** If students need help with an async activity, encourage them to attend Office Hours for help! If you can’t get through all of it, remind them that they can lean on Learning Assistants with the AskBCS bot for more help.

## Career Connection

During each lesson that students work through, they will also view a Career Connection section that will tie together the academic content with Career Services and how this material will be applicable to them in their future career.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Director and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careerservicesonlineevents.splashthat.com/).

If you'd like more information on Career Services, visit the [Career Services resources page](https://mycareerspot.org/).
