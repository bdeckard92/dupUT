# 09.1 Virtual Class: Node.js

## Overview

In today's virtual class, students will learn to use ES6 syntax and review the `fs` and Inquirer packages for Node.js.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Explain and implement arrow functions in code.

* Read and write text to a file using the `fs` package.

* Prompt the user and write the user response to a file using the Inquirer package.

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate questions students may have.

* Students will be expected to have Node.js installed, but if they don't, be sure to tell them that they can install it using the resources found on the [Node.js installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/nodejs/how-to-install-nodejs).

* Transitioning from client-side to back-end development can be a little confusing at first. Remind students that Node.js is Chrome's V8 engine running on the machine rather than in the browser, which gives us access to things like the file system.

* If students ask why they are learning Node.js, explain that Node.js allows us to create APIs and build applications using the client-server model.

* Explain to students that npm works much like embedding a CDN link for a framework directly in the HTML, except that we will download it into the project and store it in a folder called `node_modules`.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly, ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity, and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* If the students struggle with the Everyone Do: Git activity, walk through it using the talking points provided. Otherwise, support the students as they work on the activity and do a brief review at the end.

* Arrow functions are introduced in the async content in Lesson 1, and used throughout Lesson 2. Students learned about the `fs` package in Lesson 2, and Inquirer in Lesson 3.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Invite students to post questions in the Zoom chat so TAs and/or the instructor can address them at the end of class.

* Open the lesson [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1H0aiJdl8CGuQaZlLi2kaJgFvTZhcC_p5v2v2wwsXPzQ/edit?usp=sharing) and walk through the following slides on foundation setting:

    **Big Picture**: This is an opportunity to look at the big picture of where students are in the course. Take a moment to discuss a few real-world examples of why this week's topics are valuable.

    **Boot Camp Pointers**: Review some logistics that will help students stay on track. This is an opportunity to speak to what students might need at this particular point in the course.

    **This Week: Node.js**: Review the key skills students will be learning this week.

    **This Week's Assignment**: Give a quick summary of this week's Challenge assignment and describe how the skills they learn throughout the week will be applied to it.

    **Career Connection**: Reinforce that students will use the skills they learn this week throughout their careers. It's important for them to know the "why" and "how" behind the "what." Give examples of how these skills are used on the job. If you feel comfortable, share examples of how you have used them in your professional career.

    * With Project 01 completed, remind students that they need to add it to their portfolio.

      * The career team has talked to hundreds of employers across the country, and almost unanimously they've said that deployed projects on an easy-to-access portfolio are crucial when making hiring decisions.

    * Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

      * ☝️ Employers tell us that consistently committing code to GitHub is a key factor when evaluating a GitHub profile. How do employers track this?

      * 🙋 By looking at the contribution chart, employers can instantly see how often we commit code to GitHub. It's important that we regularly commit in each of our homework assignments and projects. Employer-ready criteria requires, at a bare minimum, five commits per repository.

      * ☝️ Excellent. Remember that you should each have a forked version of Project 01 in your own GitHub profile. Projects are incredibly important for boot camp graduates. Why is this?

      * 🙋 Projects showcase what we are able to do and let employers know what we can do for them.

    * Let students know that instructional psychology shows that **little and often** -- for example, coding for one or two hours for five days a week -- is much more effective than sitting down on a Sunday and coding for eight or nine hours in one long session.

    * Reinforce the idea that students should continuously be pushing code to GitHub, even if there are holidays or breaks during class. A good guideline is that code should be committed 4-5 days per week.

  **Tips for Success: Node.js**: Remind students that they might experience moments of frustration as they learn complex concepts and tools, and that these times are actually proven opportunities to deepen knowledge. Consider sharing something about your personal learning journey. This helps students recognize that everyone starts somewhere and that they are not alone.

  **Today's Agenda**: Outline the concepts that will be covered in today's lesson. Remind students that they can find the relevant activity files in the "Getting Ready for Class" page in their course content.

### 2. Instructor Do: Student Check-In (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

  * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back at what we accomplished and acknowledge that it is a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed -- as long as we don’t give up!

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic?

  * 🙋 Let's do Fist to Five together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 3. Instructor Demo: Arrow Functions (5 min)

* In the command line, navigate to `01-Arrow-Functions/Solved/` and run `node index.js` to demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We can see many things happening in the console, like converting text to `funnyCase` or pulling out the even numbers.

  * 🔑 The main takeaway here is that all the functions are using arrow functions.

  * 🔑 Explain that ES6 introduces a newer, shorter syntax for writing functions that work the same in most cases, except when working with objects.

  * 🔑 Arrow functions will bind to the context they are created in, causing some issues which you will see in the upcoming activity.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 In Lesson 1, we learned about how arrow functions will make our code cleaner looking and more concise.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

  * 🙋 Arrow functions are widely being used now to keep codes looking clean and concise.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We need to keep in mind the instances when you should or should not be using arrow functions. Also remember the proper syntax for arrow functions.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Arrow Functions (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-Arrow-Functions/README.md`, which are also shown below.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # 🐛 Fix Implementation of Arrow Functions

  Work with a partner to resolve the following issue:

  * As a user, I want to run a script that will update a movie queue.

  ## Expected Behavior

  When a user runs the script, it will add and remove movies from the queue and display the movies currently in the queue.

  ## Actual Behavior

  The script exits out with an error message.

  ## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

  To reproduce the problem, follow these steps:

  1. At the command line, navigate to the `Unsolved` folder.

  2. Run `node index.js`.

  3. Note the error that is printed.

  ## 💡 Hints

  What is an example of when we shouldn't use arrow functions?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * How can you shorten the arrow function syntax even further using implicit return statements?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 5. Instructor Review: Arrow Functions (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with arrow functions? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use Office Hours to get extra help.

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ Arrow functions

  * ✔️ `this` binding

  * ✔️ Implicit return statements

* Open `01-Arrow-Functions/Solved/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * The following `funnyCase()` function can use arrow syntax because there is no `this` context that needs to be preserved.

    ```js
    var funnyCase = string => {
      var newString = "";
      for (var i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {
        if (i % 2 === 0) newString += string[i].toLowerCase();
        else newString += string[i].toUpperCase();
      }
      return newString;
    };
    ```

  * 🔑 When using arrow functions, we can use an implied return to reduce the code even further.

    ```js
    var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

    var doubled = map(numbers, element => element * 2);
    ```

  * 🔑 We had to convert the arrow functions back to regular functions to preserve the context of `this` in the object.

    ```js
    var netflixQueue = {
      queue: [
        "Mr. Nobody",
        "The Matrix",
        "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind",
        "Fight Club"
      ],
      watchMovie: function() {
        this.queue.pop();
      },
    };
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why would you use arrow functions?

  * 🙋 The syntax is easier to write and makes for cleaner-looking code.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions), and attend Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next section.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Inquirer Users (5 min)

* In the command line, navigate to `02-Inquirer/Solved/` in your command line and run `node index.js` to demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 At the first prompt, we can type in our name.

  * 🔑 At the second prompt, we can choose multiple checkboxes of languages we know.

  * 🔑 At the last prompt, we can choose one preferred method of communication from a list.

  * 🔑 After all prompts are entered, a `.json` file is created from the name we entered at the prompt.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 In Lesson 3, we used this to formulate profile questions.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

  * 🙋 We use Inquirer to prompt the user for their GitHub username and other information for the README.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 After installing the Inquirer dependency, we create a `inquirer.prompt` method that will ask for the user's name, preferred method of communication, and languages they know. Then we write the responses to a file using the given callback function.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Inquirer Users (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Inquirer/README.md`, which are also shown below.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # 🏗️ Build CLI App Using Inquirer

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to create a command-line application that takes input from the user and does something with it.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It is done when I have initialized my repository with a `package.json` file by running `npm init -y`.

  * It is done when I have installed Inquirer and added it to my list of dependencies by running `npm i inquirer --save`.

  * It is done when the application asks the user, "What is your name?"

  * It is done when the application asks the user, "What languages do you know?"

  * It is done when the application asks the user, “What is your preferred method of communication?"

  * It is done after I have written those responses to a file.

  ## 💡 Hints

  * Why do we need to use `JSON.stringify`?

  * How can we use the npm page for Inquirer to see how to use checkboxes and lists?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * How would you format your JSON? Can you generate the name of your user file from the user input?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 8. Instructor Review: Inquirer Users (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with Inquirer? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use Office Hours to get extra help.

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `inquirer.prompt()`

  * ✔️ `JSON.stringify()`

  * ✔️ `.then(answers =>`

* Open `02-Inquirer/Solved/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 The application requires two dependencies, one third-party (Inquirer) and the other standard library (`fs`).

    ```js
    const inquirer = require('inquirer');
    const fs = require('fs');
    ```

  * 🔑 We use two new `type` properties to prompt the user for a `"checkbox"` and a `"list"`, both of which require a `choices` property and a corresponding array of options.

    ```js
      inquirer.prompt([
        {
            type: "input",
            name: "name",
            message: "What is your name?"
        },
        {
            type: "checkbox",
            message: "What languages do you know?",
            name: "stack",
            choices: [
                "HTML",
                "CSS",
                "JavaScript",
                "MySQL"
            ]
        },
        {
            type: "list",
            message: "What is your preferred method of communication?",
            name: "contact",
            choices: [
                "email",
                "phone",
                "telekinesis"
            ]
        }
    ])
    ```

  * We pass the output of the `prompt` method to the Promise callback as `data`.

    ```js
      .then((data) => {
        const filename = `${data.name.toLowerCase().split(' ').join('')}.json`;

        fs.writeFile(filename, JSON.stringify(data, null, '\t'), (err) =>
            err ? console.log(err) : console.log('Success!')
        );
    });
    ```

  * We create a file name by removing the spaces and setting all letters to lowercase. We then concat the file name using the `.join` method. Finally, we add `.json` to the file name.

    ```js
    const filename = `${data.name.toLowerCase().split(' ').join('')}.json`;
    ```

  * 🔑 We use the `fs.writeFile` method to create a new file, using the `filename` variable. We use the `JSON.stringify` optional `replacer` (`null`) and `space` (`\t`) parameters to format the `data` object with pretty-print appearance.

    ```js
    fs.writeFile(filename, JSON.stringify(data, null, '\t'), (err) =>
        err ? console.log(err) : console.log('Success!')
    );
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why do we need to use `JSON.stringify` when passing in the data?

  * 🙋 The data needs to be converted to a string because, as it is, `data` is not of type `string`. To learn more, read the [MDN Web Docs on JSON.stringify()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify).

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [Inquirer documentation](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js#readme), and attend Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next section.

### 9. Everyone Do: Git (30 min)

* Let the students know that this Git activity focuses on forking.

* Open the [Git docs on contributing to a project](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project) in your browser and explain the following:

  * Forking allows you to contribute to a repository that you don't have push access to. When you fork a project, GitHub makes an exact copy of the project and stores it on your GitHub account.

  * You can push to this copy of the project, and then create a pull request to the parent repository when you have finished your contributions. This is a very common workflow in many open source projects.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `Git-Guide/README.md`.

* While everyone is working on the activity, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

* Open your browser and choose a repository to fork. Click the green fork button.

* Open your command line and demonstrate the following:

  * After we clone the repository, we visit our own fork on GitHub and copy the Git URL to clone it the local machine. After that, we change into the directory of our forked repository:

    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/forking-tutorial.git && cd forking-tutorial
    ```

  * 🔑 After we clone the local repository, we run the following command to demonstrate that the remote is pointed to your namespace instead of the parent repository:

    ```sh
    git remote -v
    ```

* Answer any questions before proceeding.

### 10. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

  * 🙋 We covered the `readFile()` and `writeFile()` methods of the `fs` package. We also covered using Inquirer to prompt the user and write the response to a `.json` file.

  * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

  * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful.

  * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

  * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the Challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

  * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

  * 🙋 Lesson 2 covers the `fs` package, and Lesson 3 covers Inquirer.

  * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Answer any questions before ending the class.
