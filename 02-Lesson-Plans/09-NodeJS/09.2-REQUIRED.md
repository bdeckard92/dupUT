# Module 09 Virtual Class (Required): Node.js

## Overview 

In today's required virtual class, students will review ES6 features: arrow functions, functional loops, and object destructuring. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Implement how and when to use arrow functions

* Implement how and when to use functional loops: `.map()` and `.filter()`

* Destructure objects and arrays


## Instructor Notes 

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try and anticipate questions students may have.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* Arrow functions are introduced in Lesson 1 and used throughout Lesson 2. The functional loops, `.map()` and `.filter()`, and object destructuring are taught in Lesson 4

## Office Hours

Encourage students to work on the remaining module algorithms during office hours. Review the algorithm solutions 5–10 minutes before class begins or during office hours after class.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What did you learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

    * 🙋 We learned how to make our first Node.js application. We are moving fast compared to traditional learners. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ Did anyone have an "Aha!" or "Eureka!" moment this week? When was it and why did things suddenly click for you? 

    * 🙋 Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we're thinking about it.

    * ☝️ Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

    * 🙋 It's easy to get stuck when you're learning web development. It's important to learn how to get unstuck because it happens to the pros too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the tool's official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups are great because explaining your problems to someone else often reveals the solution. 


### 2. Review Current Challenge (5 min)

* Navigate to `02-Challenge/Master` in your command line and run `node index.js` to demonstrate the following: 

    * The challenge is a command line application that dynamically generates a README.md from a user's input. 

    * The user will be prompted for their GitHub username and other information pertaining to the project the README is for.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What recently acquired skills will help us build this challenge?

    * 🙋 We use the `fs` and `inquirer` packages to prompt the user for input and write them to file. We also use ES6 arrow functions to clean up our code. 

    * ☝️ How are these skills relevant to a career in web development?

    * 🙋 Node.js allows developers to write server-side code using JavaScript, the same programming language they've been using on the front-end. ES6 is a specification that added some major feature upgrades to JavaScript.

    * ☝️ How will this challenge improve your portfolio?

    * 🙋 It will demonstrate understanding of Node.js fundamentals as well as ES6.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 3. Instructor Demo: Arrow Functions (5 min) 

* Navigate to `03-Arrow-Functions/Solved/` in your command line and run `node index.js` to demonstrate the following: 

    * 🔑 We can see many things happening in the console, like doubling numbers or pulling out the even numbers. 

    * 🔑 But the key point here is to convert the functions to arrow functions and still have this same output. 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We learned about how arrow functions will make our code more clean looking and concise in Lesson 1.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 Arrow functions are widely being used now to keep codes looking clean and concise.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We need to keep in mind the instances when you should or should not be using arrow functions. Also remember the proper syntax for arrow functions. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 4. Student Do: Arrow Functions  (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `03-Arrow-Functions/README.md`.

```md
# Arrow Functions

In this activity, you will convert functions to use ES6 arrow functions where suitable.

## Instructions

* Navigate to [Unsolved](Unsolved/) in your command line and run `node index.js`

  * Take a few moments to study the values logged to the console, but don't worry about understanding every part of the code. For this activity you only need to remember the rules established about when arrow functions should and shouldn't be used.

* Open the [index.js](Unsolved/index.js) file and convert the functions to use arrow functions **where suitable**. If successful, the code should work exactly the same after the changes. 

## Bonus

* After you've converted all of the functions to arrow functions where possible, look for opportunities to shorten the arrow function syntax even further by removing parentheses and curly braces where allowed.

*  Use `let` and `const` instead of `var` when declaring variables.
```

### 5. Instructor Review: Arrow Functions  (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ When to omit the parentheses

    * ✔️ When to omit curly braces

    * ✔️ No arrow functions with object methods

* Open `03-Arrow-Functions/Solved/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * Even though we've converted a few of the examples over to use arrow functions, the code works exactly the same as it did before.

    * 🔑 When we have only one parameter, we can omit the parentheses: 

    ```js
    const funnyCase = string => {
    ```

    * However if there are more than one parameters, we need to use parentheses:

    ```js
    const filter = (arr, cb) => {
    ```    

    * 🔑 We can omit an arrow function's curly braces if the arrow function body only contains one expression:

    ```js
    const doubled = map(numbers, element => element * 2);

    const evenNumbers = filter(numbers, currentElement => currentElement % 2 === 0);
    ```

    * 🔑 Whenever we're working with objects, we usually don't want to write its methods as arrow functions.

    * Arrow functions have a different understanding of what the `this` keyword is referring to at times, so in this case, we wouldn't want to use arrow functions.

    ```js
    watchMovie: function() {
        this.queue.pop();
    },
    addMovie: function(movie) {
        this.queue.unshift(movie);
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How can we remember whether we can use arrow functions or not?

    * 🙋 In most cases, we can replace regular functions with arrow functions. But arrow functions shouldn’t be used with object methods.

    * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lessons 1 and 2, read the [MDN docs on arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 6. Instructor Demo: Functional Loops  (5 min) 

* Navigate to `04-Functional-Loops/Solved/` in your command line and run `node map.js` to demonstrate the following: 

    * 🔑 The first original array has 5 random numbers. The second array has doubled all of the numbers. The third array has tripled all of the numbers. The final array states whether the number is even or odd.

* Run `node filter.js` to demonstrate the following: 

    * 🔑 The first original array has 5 random numbers. The second array only has the even numbers. The third array only has prime numbers. The final array only has numbers larger than 5.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used the `.map()` method to iterate through the project data and for each project, we destructured the project's object data based on property name and return an entire set of HTML code with it in Lesson 4. 

    * 🙋 We then used the `.filter()` method to iterate through the project data and filter out projects based on their `feature` property in Lesson 4 also. 

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 Functional loops help us to write cleaner code and get the data we need quickly.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We will need to use `.map()` and `.filter()` methods to iterate over the arrays and return the desired values. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 7. Student Do: Functional Loops  (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Functional-Loops/README.md`.

```md
# Functional Loops

In this activity, you will use the `map` and `filter` methods to solve problems we previously would have used a `for` loop for.

## Instructions

* Open [map.js](Unsolved/map.js) and create the following:

  1. A map that triples the `originalArray` and sets the result equal to a new array, `tripledArray`.

  2. A map that takes the `originalArray` and returns a new array `oddOrEven` containing the text "even" if the number is even and the text "odd" if the number is odd. 
    
    * For example, using this map, the array [3, 1, 2, 4] should give us back ["odd", "odd", "even", "even"].

* Open [filter.js](Unsolved/filter.js) and create the following:

  1. A filter that runs through the `originalArray` and creates a new array `primeArray` containing only its prime numbers. You will need to use the `isPrime` function provided.

  2. A filter that runs through the `originalArray` and creates a new array `moreThan5Array` containing only its numbers larger than 5.

## Bonus

* Use arrow functions as callbacks.
```

### 8. Instructor Review: Functional Loops  (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ `.map()`

    * ✔️ `.filter()`

* Open `04-Functional-Loops/Solved/map.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * `tripledArray` is similar to the `doubledArray` above it.

    * 🔑 The `.map()` method will iterate through the array and execute a callback function for each element. Whatever it returns is what goes into the corresponding index of the new array, `tripledArray`.

    ```js
    const tripledArray = originalArray.map(data => data * 3);
    ```

    * The `oddOrEven` map took the `originalArray` and checked each number to see if it's cleanly divisible by 2 or not (determine if the number is even or odd):

    ```js
    const oddOrEven = originalArray.map(num => (num % 2 === 0 ? "even" : "odd"));
    ```

* If the arrow function syntax is still confusing to the students, refactor the solutions to use regular functions instead.

* Open `04-Functional-Loops/Solved/filter.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

    * We don't need to pass an anonymous function into the `.map()` and `.filter()` methods. We can write a named function and use that instead:

    ```js
    const isPrime = num => {
        for (let i = 2; i < num; i++) {
            if (num % i === 0) return false;
        }
        return num !== 1;
    };

    const primeArray = originalArray.filter(isPrime);
    ```

    * 🔑 The `.filter()` method will iterate through the array and only return the elements that are truthy. That element is copied to the new array. Otherwise it is skipped.
    
    ```js
    const moreThan5Array = originalArray.filter(num => num > 5);
    ```

    * Therefore `primeArray` should contain an array of only prime numbers and `moreThan5Array` should only contain numbers larger than 5.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What is a real life example of when you need to filter through something?

    * 🙋 When shopping for pants, you're filtering out all the ones on the rack that aren't your size.

    * ☝️ What is a real life example of when you need to map over something?

    * 🙋 When you're mapping through your laundry pile, categorizing your clothes so you can put them into the correct drawers.

    * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understanding this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 4, read the [MDN docs for .map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) and [MDN docs for .filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 9. Instructor Demo: Object Destructuring  (5 min) 

* Navigate to `05-Obj-Destructuring/Solved/` in your command line and run `node index.js` to demonstrate the following: 

    * 🔑 Object destructuring is a way for us to pull properties off of an object into separate variables for easier access.

    * 🔑 After destructuring the objects, only the properties we specify will be logged into the console.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used this to pull out `projects` and `about` data from `templateData` based on their property key names in Lesson 4.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 Destructuring objects will help us to pull out data that we need to easier access. 

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We need to use ES6 object destructuring to pull out object data into variables that will be logged into the console. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 10. Student Do: Object Destructuring  (20 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `05-Obj-Destructuring/README.md`.

```md
# Object Destructuring

In this activity, you will use ES6 object destructuring to pull out object data into variables.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/index.js](Unsolved/index.js) and write ES6 destructuring code to pull out the data that is logged in the console.

  1. Destructure the object `arya`

  2. Destructure the nested object `john`

  3. Destructure the array `characters`

  4. Destructure the string `skills`

## Hint(s)

* Use `.split()` to split the string into variables
```

### 11. Instructor Review: Object Destructuring  (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ Object destructuring

    * ✔️ Array destructuring

    * ✔️ String destructuring using `.split()`

* Open `05-Obj-Destructuring/Solved/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 For a simple object, we can destructure data based on their property key names:

    ```js
    const arya = {
        first: "Arya",
        last: "Stark",
        origin: "Winterfell",
    };

    const { first, last, origin } = arya;
    ```

    * For a nested object, we need to be more specific:

    ```js
    const john = {
      first: "John",
      last: "Snow",
      title: "Prince",
      family: {
        brothers: {
          brother1: "Rob Stark",
          brother2: "Rickon Stark"
        },
        sisters: {
          sister1: "Arya Stark",
          sister2: "Sansa Stark"
        }
      }
    };

    const { brother1, brother2 } = john.family.brothers;
    ```

    * 🔑 For arrays, we can destructure data by the index:

    ```js
    const characters = ["Ned Stark", "The Quiet Wolf", "House Stark"];

    const [name, alias, allegiance] = characters;
    ```

    * 🔑 For strings, we can destructure data by using `.split()` to split the string at the comma:

    ```js
    const skills = "male, Baratheon, Cersei";

    const [gender, family, spouse] = skills.split(","); 
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How is this also possible with function parameters?

    * 🙋 This allows us to have named function parameters. We can simply pull the properties without worrying about the order they're passed in or write extra code to destructure them the old way.

    * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understanding this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 4, read the [MDN web docs on destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 12. Recap & Promote Additional Resources (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What do you think you absolutely need to know to succeed at the challenge?

    * 🙋 To complete the challenge, we need to know how to get and store user input using prompts. We also need to use ES6 arrow functions to make our code easier to read.

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it is not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful. 

    * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material prior to class as possible?

    * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

* Direct students to the additional resources available to them:

    * Reflection and Retrieval

    * Career Connection

    * Dessert Menu

### 13. Introduce Upcoming Challenge (5 min)

* Navigate to `01-Class-Content/10-OOP/02-Challenge/Master/` in your command line and run `node app.js` to demonstrate the following: 

    * This upcoming challenge is to build a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

    * The application prompts the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. 
    
    * When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What are we learning?

    * 🙋 We are not only continuing to use Node.js to build an application, but we are also learning how to write unit tests.

    * ☝️ How does this project build off or extend previously learned material?

    * 🙋 We are continuing to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as Node.js and ES6 syntax.

    * ☝️ How does this project relate to your career goals?

    * 🙋 Since many employers will require their applications to be built in TDD, knowing how to write good unit tests will be vital to your career. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 14. Office Hours (30 min)

* Announce office hours and encourage students to stay on the Zoom and start the challenge while they have live support from instructional staff.
