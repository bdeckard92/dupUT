## Class Instructions 

### 1. Introduction (5 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Direct students to post individual questions in the Zoom chat to be addressed by TAs and/or at the end of class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

    * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back and see what we accomplished, and acknowledge that it's a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic? 

    * 🙋 Let's do "fist to five" together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).


### 2. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* [Click here for CodeSignal challenge](https://app.codesignal.com/public-test/mdJyqx2DGxonY2iCR/TjhHFtNLZ8E9Qj) 

* With Project #1 out of the way, remind students now that they need to add it to their portfolio. 

    * Career Services has talked to hundreds of employers across the country, and almost unanimously they've said that deployed projects on an easy-to-access portfolio is crucial when making hiring decisions! 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Did anyone attempt the Code Signal algorithm?

    * 🙋 It is encouraged to take advantage of the CodeSignal practice because it reflects real-world online interviewing.

* Open your IDE and review the solution to the Code Signal algorithm:

    * The algorithm is called `arrayRotation`. We are given an array of numbers, `arr`, and an integer, `n`, and we need to perform `n` left rotations on the array. 

    * Explain that a left rotation on an array shifts each element of the array one unit to the left.

    * For sequence `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `n = 2`, then the output should be `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`.

    * The instructions provide the following details regarding input and output:

    ```
    Output = [3,4,5,1,2]

    [execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)

    [input] array.integer arr

    [input] integer n

    [output] array.integer
    ```

* We are also provided the following starter code:

```js
function arrayRotation(arr, n) {

}
```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝) and call on students for answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What is the first step to solve this problem?

    * 🙋 In order to move things in the array, it might be easiest to create a new clone of the array that we can modify! We can do that with `.slice(0)`. 

    * ☝ Great idea! So something like `let temp = arr.slice(0)` would get that situated for us. What's next?

    * 🙋 We'll need a loop that goes through the input array as many times as the value of `n` and grabs the first item in the array and moves it to the end. 

    * ☝ Exactly. Let's take a look at how to do that. In this code, we remove the first item of the array, and store it in a temporary variable `first`, and then use the `.push()` method to take that variable and _push_ it on to the end of the array.

    ```js
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        let first = temp.shift();
        temp.push(first);
    }
    ```

    * ☝ And don't forget we need to return the value at the end: `return temp`. And with that, we're all done!

* Full solution:

```js
function arrayRotation(arr, n) {
    let temp = arr.slice(0);

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        let first = temp.shift();

        temp.push(first);
    }

    return temp;
}
```

* Answer any questions students have before moving to the next activity.

### 3. Instructor Demo: File System (5 min) 

* Navigate to `01-File-System/Solved/` in your command line and run `node index.js Hello` and demonstrate the following: 

    * 🔑 We see a confirmation message "Done!" along with the word we provided, "Hello".

    * 🔑 We also see that it created a `log.txt` file with the word "Hello" in it.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used the `fs` package to capture command line arguments in Lesson 2 using the `writeFile()` method. 

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We use `fs` methods to write the user's responses to the README file.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We need to use the `writeFile()` method to capture the user's input and write it to file. Then we need to use the `readFile()` method to print the contents of that file in the console.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 4. Student Do: File System (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-File-System/README.md`.

    ```md
    # File System Methods

    In this activity, you will read and write text to a file using the `fs` package.

    ## Instructions

    * Create a `index.js` file.

    * The app should accept a command line argument and use it to create a text file and write to it. 

    * Also include a method that will read the newly created text file. 

    ## Hint(s)

    * You may need to consult [the Node.js `fs` documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) for the appropriate method and its usage. 
    ```


### 5. Instructor Review: File System (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ `require`

    * ✔️ `writeFile()`

    * ✔️ `readFile()`

* Open `01-File-System/Solved/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 We import the `fs`, or file system module, using `require` and store it in a variable named `fs`.

    ```js
    const fs = require("fs");
    ```

    * 🔑 In order to create a new file and write to it, we will need to use the `fs` method, `writeFile()`.

    * Currently, there is no `log.txt` file yet. This method will create the `log.txt` file and write to it the second argument `process.argv[2]` of the command line. 

    * If there are no errors, it will print "Done!" in the console.

    ```js
    fs.writeFile("log.txt", process.argv[2], function(err) {

    if (err) {
        return console.log(err);
    }

    console.log("Done!");

    });
    ```

    * 🔑 Finally, in order to read the newly created file, we will need to use the `fs` method, `readFile()`.

    * The `readFile()` method will read the newly created `log.txt` file using the encoding format we want to use and log the contents in a variable, `log`. 

    * In the callback function, if there are no errors, it will print the variable `log` in the console.

    ```js
    fs.readFile("log.txt", "utf8", function(error, log) {

      if (error) {
        return console.log(error);
      }
  
      console.log(log);
  
    });
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What is the difference between the `readFile()` and `writeFile()` methods?

    * 🙋 The first argument of `readFile()` will read the contents of an already existing file, while the first argument of `writeFile()` will create a non-existent file. Also, the second argument of `readFile()` is specifying an encoding format, but the second argument of `writeFile()` is `process.argv[2]` which will store the command line argument. 

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understanding this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 2, read the [the Node.js `fs` documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 6. Instructor Demo: Inquirer Users (5 min) 

* Navigate to `02-Inquirer-Users/Solved/` in your command line and run `node index.js` and demonstrate the following: 

    * 🔑 At the first prompt, we can type in our name. 
    
    * 🔑 At the second prompt, we can choose one preferred method of communication from a list. 
    
    * 🔑 At the last prompt, we can choose multiple checkboxes of languages we know.

    * 🔑 After all prompts are entered, a `.json` file is created from the name we entered at the prompt, for example: `lernantino.json`.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used this to formulate profile questions in Lesson 3. 

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We use `inquirer` to prompt the user for their GitHub username and other information for the README.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 After installing the `inquirer` dependency, create a `inquirer.prompt` method that will ask for the user's name, preferred method of communication, and languages they know. Then write the responses to a file using the given callback function.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 7. Student Do: Inquirer Users (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Inquirer-Users/README.md`.

    ```md
    # Inquirer Users

    In this activity, you will build a simple command line application that accepts user input and writes it to a `.json` file. 


    ## Instructions

    * Open [Unsolved/index.js](Unsolved/index.js) and install the `inquirer` dependency.

    * Prompt your user with the following questions:

        * "What is your name?"

        * "What is your preferred method of communication?"
        
        * "What languages do you know?"

    * Then write the user response to a file using the given callback function by chaining this callback method to the prompt.

    ## Hint(s)

    * You may need to consult [the `inquirer` documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) on how to prompt users for lists and checkboxes.

    ## Bonus

    * Can you generate the name of your user file from their input?
    ```

### 8. Instructor Review: Inquirer Users (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ `inquirer` for user prompts

    * ✔️ `"input"`, `"checkbox"`, `"list"` for `type` properties

    * ✔️ `.then()`

* Open `02-Inquirer-Users/Solved/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 Our application requires two dependencies, `fs` and `inquirer`.

    ```js
    const fs = require('fs');
    const inquirer = require('inquirer');
    ```

    * 🔑 We build our `inquirer.prompt` method using `"input"`, `"checkbox"` and a `"list"` for our `type` properties.

    ```js
    inquirer.prompt([
    {
        type: "input",
        name: "name",
        message: "What is your name?"
    },
    {
        type: "list",
        message: "What is your preferred method of communication?",
        name: "contact",
        choices: [
        "email",
        "phone",
        "Slack",
        "smoke signal"
        ]
    },
    {
        type: "checkbox",
        message: "What languages do you know?",
        name: "stack",
        choices: [
        "HTML", 
        "CSS", 
        "JavaScript", 
        "SQL"
        ]
    }
    ])
    ```

    * 🔑 The callback function was given to you. We chain it to the prompt by using `.then()`. 
    
    * We pass the output of the prompt method to our Promise callback as data.

    ```js
    .then(function(data) {
    ```

    * For the bonus, we create a `filename` variable by converting the value in `data.name` to lowercase, removing any spaces using `split(' ')` and then joining the split values back together without spaces using `.join('')`. We concatenate this value with `".json"` to add a file extension.

    ```js
    const filename = data.name.toLowerCase().split(' ').join('') + ".json";
    ``` 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ If you didn't do the bonus question, then how could we have modified the `writeFile()` method?

    * 🙋 We would need to manually create a `.json` file by specifying it as the first argument.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understanding this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 3, read the [the `inquirer` documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 09. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

    * 🙋 We covered the `readFile()` and `writeFile()` methods of the `fs` package. We also covered using `inquirer` to prompt the user and write it to a `.json` file.

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful.
