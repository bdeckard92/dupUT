# Inquirer Users

In this activity, you will build a simple command line application that accepts user input and writes it to a `.json` file. 


## Instructions

* Initialize your repository and install the `inquirer` dependency.

    * Is there another dependency you will need? 

* Prompt your user with the following questions:

    * "What is your name?"

    * "What languages do you know?"

    * What is your preferred method of communciation?"

* Then write the user response to a file. 


## Hint(s)

* You will need to use `JSON.stringify()`.

* You will need to consult the `inquirer` documentation on how to prompt users for checkboxes and lists.


## Bonus

* How would you format your JSON?

* Can you generate the name of your user file from their input?
