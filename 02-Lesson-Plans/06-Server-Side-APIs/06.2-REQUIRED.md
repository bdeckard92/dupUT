# Module 06 Virtual Class (Required): Server Side APIs

## Overview 

In today's required virtual class, students will take user input to make specific API calls, use multiple query params, and use some nested API calls. 

Students will also be assigned to their project groups and go over the project requirements.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Use user input to make specific API calls

* Use multiple query params in a single API call

* Use nested API calls

## Instructor Notes 

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try and anticipate questions students may have.

* In the async material, students learned how to make dynamic API calls with user input in Lesson 3. In Lesson 4, students used query parameters to pass the repo name in the API request to GitHub's API. The response from the API call was then used to populate the single repo html page's details.

* Be prepared to announce project groups and go over the [project requirements](../../01-Class-Content/06-Server-Side-APIs/04-Supplemental/Project-Requirements.md). 

## Office Hours 

Encourage students to work on the remaining module algorithms during Office Hours. Review the algorithm solutions 5–10 minutes before class begins or during Office Hours after class.

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What did you learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

    * 🙋 We learned how to make requests to server-side APIs using the `fetch()` function, display the resulting response data on the page using JavaScript, and used query parameters to transfer information between html pages. We are moving fast compared to traditional learners. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ Did anyone have an "Aha!" or "Eureka!" moment this week? When was it and why did things suddenly click for you? 

    * 🙋 Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we're thinking about it.

    * ☝️ Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

    * 🙋 It's easy to get stuck when you're learning web development. It's important to learn how to get unstuck because it happens to the pros too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the tool's official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups are great because explaining your problems to someone else often reveals the solution. 

### 2. Review Current Challenge (5 min)

* Open `02-Challenge/Master/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

    * When we enter a city in the search box, we receive the current forecast, temperature, and humidity.

    * We also receive a 5-day forecast nicely displayed in their own boxes with all the relevant information.

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

    * ☝️ What recently acquired skills will help us build this challenge?

    * 🙋 We can use `fetch` to make complex API calls and JavaScript to dynamically display responses to our screen.

    * ☝️ How are these skills relevant to a career in web development?

    * 🙋 Creating nice UIs and displaying responses from API requests is a big part of web development and an important skill you are fostering.

    * ☝️ How will this challenge improve your portfolio?

    * 🙋 Working with APIs is an essential part of web development.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 3. Instructor Demo: GIF Search (5 min) 

* Open `03-Gif-Search/Solved/assets/js/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

    * When we search for a term, we get a GIF relating to that topic.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We made dynamic calls to an API with user input in Lesson 3 to GitHub API endpoints.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 Accepting user input and dynamically using it in API calls is essential for completing the challenge.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We first need to get the value of the search term, and implant that value into our fetch query URL.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: GIF Search (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `03-Gif-Search/README.md`.

```md
# Call Giphy's Search API endpoint with a search term

In this activity you will call Giphy's search API with a search term entered by the user. 

## Instructions

Using the starter code in `/Unsolved`, ensure the following functionality:

* There's an input field in `index.html` that collects a search term from the user, and a Search button to submit the term.

* Pressing the Search button triggers a request to Giphy, with a `q` query string parameter set to the value the input field.

* The `response-container` element in the DOM is updated with the image from the Giphy response.

* The image returned from Giphy should be related to the search term entered by the user. (It's likely this relationship will be loose.)

## Hint(s)

* You will need to update both `index.html` and `script.js` to handle the user's search term.

* Take a look at the Giphy search [API endpoint docs](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/endpoint#search).

* You'll need to wrap the JavaScript in a function that can be called when the button is clicked. You can use an `onlclick` attribute on the button element to trigger the function.
```

### 5. Instructor Review: GIF Search (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ `.value()`

    * ✔️ `response.data[0]`

* Open `03-Gif-Search/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * We create a function called `myFunction()`. We do this so that this function can be executed when the search button is clicked. Using the onclick attribute for HTML elements.

    ```js
    function myFunction() {}
    ```

    ```html
    <button onclick="myFunction()">Search!</button>
    ```

    * 🔑 Next, we obtain the value of the search term entered in the textbox by targeting the text box and using the `.value()` method.

    ```js
    let searchTerm = document.querySelector("#searchTerm").value;
    ```

    * Now we setup our `fetch` request, concatenating our `searchTerm` into the query url.

    ```js
    fetch('https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?q=' + searchTerm + '&api_key=HvaacROi9w5oQCDYHSIk42eiDSIXH3FN&limit=1')
    ```

    * The first thing we will do inside of our fetch is capture our users input. We do this by using `document.querySelector` to target the ID of the input, and use `.value` to capture the value of the input, storing it in a variable. Setting the innerHTML empties the div on each search so we do not just append a GIF everytime.

    ```js
    .then((response) => {
      let responseContainerEl = document.querySelector("#response-container")
      responseContainerEl.innerHTML = ''
    }
    ```

    * 🔑 Finally we create our `<img>` element again and the only difference here is that because we are receiving more than one image, we need to specify the index of the `data` response that we want.

    ```js
        gifImg.setAttribute("src", response.data[0].images.fixed_height.url)
        responseContainerEl.appendChild(gifImg)
      });
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What is the value of taking user input into our API calls?

    * 🙋 This allows for much better user engagement with our applications as we can tailor searches and calls to what the user wants!

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understanding this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [MDN Docs on Object.value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Object/values), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Query Params (5 min) 

* Open `04-Query-Params/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

    * We can enter a search term, and specify a "rating" of G through PG-13 for our GIF.

    * Multiple user inputs allow for more specific calls, getting more relevant results for a user.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 In the async material, students used query parameters in the API request to sort the list of issues from GitHub in ascending order, `/issues?direction=asc`. Students also parsed the query URL to retrieve the query parameter to make dynamic APIs requests in Lesson 4.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 Working with APIs is really all about handling user input, and the API's response. It's important to understand that you can inject many different user inputs into a query URL to create a more specific and tailored experience.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We would take the same approach as our previous activity, but this time we would concatenate two different user inputs into two different params to the API.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Query Params (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Query-Params/README.md`.

```md
# Giphy API call with rating parameter

In this activity you will add a "rating" parameter to the Giphy API call. This parameter filters Giphy results based on the MPAA rating system: G, PG, PG-13.

## Instructions

Using the starter code in `/Unsolved`, ensure the following functionality:

* Users can select a G, PG, or PG-13 rating from a select menu

* Pressing the Search button submits the `fetch()` request to Giphy, with the `rating` parameter set to the chosen value.

* The `response-container` element in the DOM is updated with the image in the Giphy response.

* The image returned from Giphy should have the appropriate `rating` value (or lower) in the response. You can check this by using the Chrome DevTools network tab.

## Hint(s)

* Take a look at the Giphy search [API endpoint docs](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/endpoint#search).

* Adding the rating is very similar to adding `searchTerm` in the previous activity.

* You will need to update both `index.html` and `script.js` to handle the selected rating option.

* Remember the query string parameters are separated by an ampersand (`&`).
```

### 8. Instructor Review: Query Params (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ `.value`

    * ✔️ `response.data[0]`

* Open `04-Query-Params/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * Just like the previous activity, we wrap our code in a function that will be executed on click.

    ```js
    function myFunction() {
    ```

    ```html
    <button onclick="myFunction()">Search!</button>
    ```

    * Now we setup our `fetch` request, concatenating our `searchTerm` and `rating` into the query url.

    ```js
     fetch('https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?q=' + searchTerm + '&rating=' + rating + '&api_key=HvaacROi9w5oQCDYHSIk42eiDSIXH3FN&limit=1')
    ```

    * 🔑 The first thing we will do inside of our fetch is make sure we capture both user inputs. We do this by using `document.querySelector` to target the IDs of the inputs, and use `.value` to capture the value of the input, storing each in the variables used in the query URL.

    ```js
    const searchTerm = document.querySelector("#searchTerm").value;
    const rating = document.querySelector("#rating").value;
    ```

    * 🔑 Finally we create our `<img>` element again and the only difference here is that because we are receiving more than one image, we need to specify the index of the `data` response that we want.

    ```js
        gifImg.setAttribute("src", response.data[0].images.fixed_height.url)
        responseContainerEl.appendChild(gifImg)
      });
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What do multiple query params allow for?

    * 🙋 It allows us to make more specific API calls.

    * ☝️ Whats the benefit of more specific API calls?

    * 🙋 We should receive more relevant data.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understanding this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to the lesson plan and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Instructor Demo: Nested API Calls (5 min) 

* Open `05-Nested-API-Calls/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

    * When we enter a rating and click search, we receive the title of a Wikipedia article, and also a GIF related to that specific search.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 In Lesson 2, students used the `.then()` to handle the response from the fetch call to the GitHub API. If the response was valid, it was then converted to JSON. The next `.then()` called the function to display the data results.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 Nesting API calls is an important skill to have and can help to obtain lots of data from several sources all chaining from a single function.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We make one call, and `.then()` after the response make another!

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 10. Student Do: Nested API Calls (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `05-Nested-API-Calls/README.md`.

```md
# Nesting a Giphy API call inside a Wikipedia API call

In this activity, you're going to extend the code in the previous activity. You'll first make a call to Wikipedia's API
to get the title of a random article. You'll then pass that value to Giphy as the search term.

## Instructions

Using the starter code in `/Unsolved`, ensure the following functionality:

* Remove the `searchTerm` input from `index.html`

* Add a new element to display the Wikipedia article title above the Giphy result.

* Pressing the Search button submits a `fetch()` request to Wikipedia using this URL: `https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&format=json&list=random&rnnamespace=0&rnlimit=1&origin=*`

* The article title is displayed in the HTML, above the Giphy result.

* The article title is passed to Giphy as the `searchTerm`, and the resulting image is displayed below the title.

## Hint(s)

* You can look at [Wikipedia's API Sandbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:ApiSandbox#action=query&format=json&list=random&rnnamespace=0&rnlimit=1) to see what your results should look like.

* You can look at the Wikipedia URL in your browser to see the structure of the results. Note that there's an array in there!

* You'll need to make the Giphy `fetch()` request in the `.then()` block following the Wikipedia `fetch()` request.

* You're going to be working with two sets of `fetch()` results simultaneously. It might be helpful to name their variables differently to keep track.
```

### 11. Instructor Review: Nested API Calls (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key point(s):

    * ✔️ `fetch()` to wikipedia

    * ✔️ `return fetch(Giphy)

* Open `05-Nested-API-Calls/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * First we create our `myFunction()` to wrap all of our logic.

    ```js
    function myFunction() {}
    ```

    * Next we create a fetch to Wikipedia.

    ```js
    fetch('https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&format=json&list=random&rnnamespace=0&rnlimit=1&origin=*')
    ```

    * We transform the response to JSON.

    ```js
    return wikiResponse.json();
    ```

    * We `.then()` pull out the search term and store it in a variable using the JSON response.

    ```js
    var searchTerm = wikiResponse.query.random[0].title;
    ```

    * We target the HTML element with the ID of `response-header`, which we will then change the innerHTML to show the wiki article title.

    ```js
    var responseHeaderEl = document.querySelector("#response-header");
    responseHeaderEl.innerHTML = '<h2>' + searchTerm + '</h2>';
    ```

    * Next we grab the rating from the response.

    ```js
    var rating = document.getElementById("rating").value;
    ```

    * Finally, we `return` a `fetch` request to the Giphy API, inputing the `searchTerm` and `rating` variables we stored earlier.

    ```js
    return fetch('https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?q=' + searchTerm + '&rating=' + rating + '&api_key=HvaacROi9w5oQCDYHSIk42eiDSIXH3FN&limit=1')
    ```

    * To finish this off, we parse out the response just like the have in the previous activities. We add a bit of error handing first though after converting the response to JSON. This is to ensure that if there is no response from Giphy, we send a console message relaying the information.

    ```js
    .then((response) => {
        return response.json();
    })
    .then(response => {
        if (response.data.length === 0) {
        console.log('Giphy could not find anything for that.');
    ```

    * If we do receive a response, we move to the `else` statement and display the response to the page like previous activities.

    ```js
    } else {
      console.log(response.data[0])
      var responseContainerEl = document.querySelector("#response-container")
      responseContainerEl.innerHTML = ''
      var gifImg = document.createElement("img");
      gifImg.setAttribute("src", response.data[0].images.fixed_height.url)
      responseContainerEl.appendChild(gifImg);
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How is making nested API calls valuable?

    * 🙋 We can gather information from one API and using the response, return another `fetch()` which will make another request using previously obtained data. This allows us to make dynamic and complex requests using a single function.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understanding this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to the lesson plan and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 12. Recap & Promote Additional Resources (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What do you think you absolutely need to know to succeed at the challenge?

    * 🙋 How to handle the API request response in a fetch function with the `then()` promise.

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's unnecessary to know anything completely to be successful. 

    * ☝️  Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material prior to class as possible?

    * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

* Direct students to the additional resources available to them:

    * Reflection and Retrieval

    * Career Connection

    * Dessert Menu

### 13. Introduce Group Project (5 min)

* Announce the project groups.

    * Encourage the groups to set up a time this weekend to brainstorm project ideas. 

    * Project ideas will be approved by the instructor by next week's Module 07 Recommended Class.

* Go over project requirements

    *  Direct students to the project requirements found in `06-Server-Side-APIs/04-Supplemental/Project-Requirements.md`

    ```md
    # Project Requirements

    * Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.

    * Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

    * Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

    * Use at least two server-side APIs.

    * Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).

    * Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

    * Be responsive.

    * Have a polished UI.

    * Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

    * Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

    * Finally, you must add your project to the portfolio that you created in Module 2.

    ### More details about the project will be provided in Module 7.
    ```

    * Let students know detailed project information will be given in the async material for Module 7. 

* Since this is the first time the students will be working collaboratively, they will learn agile development methodologies and implement feature and bug fixes using the Git branch workflow and pull requests.

    * Next week's Recommended Class will cover agile methodologies, so it is **highly recommended** that everyone attends.

### 14. Office Hours (30 min)

* Announce office hours and encourage students to stay on the Zoom and start the challenge while they have live support from instructional staff.

### 15. End
