# 06.2 Virtual Class: Server-Side APIs

## Overview

In today's virtual class, students will take user input to make specific API calls, use multiple query params, and use some nested API calls.

Students will also be assigned to their project groups and go over the project requirements.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Use user input to make specific API calls

* Use multiple query params in a single API call

* Use nested API calls

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try and anticipate questions students may have.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* When reviewing activities, ask for volunteers to share their solutions and/or ask students to walk through the solution line by line.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* If you are comfortable doing so, share your struggle and/or personal experiences learning and working with the concepts covered in this lesson.

* In the async material, students learned how to make dynamic API calls with user input in Lesson 3. In Lesson 4, students used query parameters to pass the repo name in the API request to GitHub's API. The response from the API call was then used to populate the single repo html page's details.

* Be prepared to announce project groups and go over the [project requirements](../../01-Class-Content/06-Server-Side-APIs/04-Supplemental/Project-Requirements.md).

## Office Hours

Encourage students to work on the remaining module algorithms during Office Hours. Review the algorithm solutions 5–10 minutes before class begins or during Office Hours after class.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What did you learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

  * 🙋 We learned how to make requests to server-side APIs using the `fetch()` function, display the resulting response data on the page using JavaScript, and used query parameters to transfer information between html pages. We are moving fast compared to traditional learners. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

  * ☝️ Did anyone have an "Aha!" or "Eureka!" moment this week? When was it and why did things suddenly click for you?

  * 🙋 Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we're thinking about it.

  * ☝️ Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

  * 🙋 It's easy to get stuck when you're learning web development. It's important to learn how to get unstuck because it happens to the pros too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the tool's official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups are great because explaining your problems to someone else often reveals the solution.

### 2. Review Current Challenge (5 min)

* Open `02-Challenge/Main/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * When we enter a city in the search box, we receive the current forecast, temperature, and humidity.

  * We also receive a 5-day forecast nicely displayed in their own boxes with all the relevant information.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What recently acquired skills will help us build this Challenge?

  * 🙋 We can use `fetch` to make complex API calls and JavaScript to dynamically display responses to our screen.

  * ☝️ How are these skills relevant to a career in web development?

  * 🙋 Creating attractive UIs and displaying responses from API requests is a big part of web development and an important skill you are fostering.

  * ☝️ How will this Challenge improve your portfolio?

  * 🙋 Working with APIs is an essential part of web development.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 3. Instructor Demo: Dynamic HTML (5 min)

* Open `03-Demo_Dynamic/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 When we press the "Click Me" button, the page is populated with dynamically generated HTML.

  * 🔑 We see a list of the last five GitHub users and a link to their profile.

  * 🔑 In this application, we grab the root elements off the page where we want the elements to be inserted.

  * 🔑 Then we can make a `fetch` request and loop through the response to populate the page.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Can this all be done without a third-party library?

  * 🙋 Yes! `fetch()` and other features of plain JavaScript will allow us to achieve this.

  * ☝️ How is this useful?

  * 🙋 It allows us to display the API responses on a webpage dynamically!

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We would loop over the data provided by the `fetch()` response. On each loop, we create an HTML element, give it the content of the response, and append it to the page.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Dynamic HTML (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `03-Demo_Dynamic/README.md`, which are also shown here:

  ```md
  # 🏗️ Implement a fetch() Request to Display GitHub Data as HTML

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a user, I want to see a list of GitHub users and links to their profiles.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when I press the "Click Me" button, and a list of five GitHub users appears underneath on the page.

  * It's done when each user includes their login name and a URL to their GitHub profile.

  ---

  ## 💡 Hints

  * Use the previous three exercises as references if needed to put this together.

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What are some other third-party APIs you could make `fetch()` requests to?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 5. Instructor Review: Dynamic HTML (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with generating HTML from Fetch data? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use Office Hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `document.getElementById`

  * ✔️ `for` loop

  * ✔️ dot notation

  * ✔️ `document.createElement`

  * ✔️ `.append`

* Open `03-Demo_Dynamic/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We use `document.getElementById` to target the `users` `<div>`and the `fetch-button` `<div>`. We save them to the variables `usersContainer` and `fetchButton` respectively.

    ```js
    var usersContainer = document.getElementById('users');
    var fetchButton = document.getElementById('fetch-button');
    ```

  * We use `fetch()` to make a request to receive some data. We are sure to convert it to JSON so that it can be more easily consumed.

    ```js
    fetch(requestUrl)
    .then(function (response) {
      return response.json();
    })
    .then(function (data) {
      console.log(data);
    ```

  * 🔑 We use a `for` loop to iterate through the response data.

    ```js
    for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) 
    ```

  * 🔑 On each iteration, we create an `h3` and `p` tag.

    ```js
    var userName = document.createElement('h3');
    var userUrl = document.createElement('p');
    ```

  * 🔑 We take the `.login` and `.url` properties off of the current iteration of the `data` array, making those the `textContent` of the `userName` and `userUrl` tags we created.

    ```js
    userName.textContent = data[i].login;
    userUrl.textContent = data[i].url;
    ```

  * 🔑 We finally append the created elements with their newly added text content to the `<div>`.

    ```js
    usersContainer.append(userName);
    usersContainer.append(userUrl);
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why do we look at the response data properties?

  * 🙋 So that we know which data we need to use.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [GitHub documentation on REST](https://docs.github.com/en/rest), and attend Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Deconstruct Parameters (5 min)

* Open `04-Deconstruct_Parameters/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 Sometimes we need to make a specific request to be sure we receive only the information we want.

  * 🔑 We can change requests by chaining parameters onto the endpoints.

  * 🔑 We can find these parameters in the APIs documentation.

  * 🔑 For example, we can limit the number of results returned by using the `per_page` parameter. Another example is the `since` parameter, which allows us to return results starting from a specific date.

  * 🔑 Research of the API documentation will help us understand how to use these parameters and how to chain them together.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 In Lesson 4, students used query parameters in their API requests to sort the list of issues from GitHub in ascending order. Students also parsed the query URL to retrieve the query parameter to make dynamic APIs requests.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

  * 🙋 Working with APIs is really all about handling user input, and the API's response. It's important to understand that you can inject many different user inputs into a query URL to create a more specific and tailored experience.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We could use the `fetch()` method to make a request to the GitHub API, but we would need to pass in a `query` parameter or multiple parameters to tell the API what we want.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Deconstruct Parameters (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Deconstruct-Params/README.md`, which are also shown here:

  ```md
  # 🐛  Fetch request lacks query parameters

  Work with a partner to resolve the following issue:

  * As a user, I want to be able to customize the parameters of a fetch request.

  ## Expected Behavior

  When a user names a request, a list of 10 open issues is returned in descending order by creation date.

  ## Actual Behavior

  When a user makes a request, a list of issues is returned regardless of the issue status, creation date, or number of items per page.

  ## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

  Follow these steps to reproduce the problem:

  1. Open `index.html` in a browser.

  2. Open the developer console.

  3. Notice that the array in the develop console does not contain the expected number or order of items.

  ---

  ## 💡 Hints

  * How can we use the GitHub Issues API documentation to help us refine our query parameters?

  * What other parameters can you add to the fetch request when using the GitHub Issues API?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What do the `&` and `=` characters mean in a query string?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 8. Instructor Review: Deconstruct Parameters (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel using parameters? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use Office Hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:
  
  * ✔️ `?`

  * ✔️ `&`

  * ✔️ `state=open`

  * ✔️ `sort=created`

  * ✔️ `direction=desc`

* Open `04-Deconstruct_Parameters/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We attached multiple parameters after `?` in the URL.

    ```js
    fetch('.......?per_page=10&state=open&sort=created&direction=desc')
    ```

  * 🔑 We limit the results to 10 per page.
  
    ```js
    per_page=10
    ```

  * 🔑 We chain multiple parameters using the `&` symbol. The first chained parameter is `state`, setting the value to `open`&mdash;which will show us only `open` issues.

    ```js
    per_page=10&state=open
    ```

  * 🔑 We `sort` them by their creation date.

      ```js
      sort=created
      ```

  * 🔑 We then pass a parameter to display them in descending order.

    ```js
    direction=desc
    ```
  
  * Ensure that you review what each parameter filters in the comments section.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where do we write the parameters?

  * 🙋 After `?` in the URL.

  * ☝️ How do we chain multiple parameters?

  * 🙋 With the `&` symbol.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the documentation for the API that we're accessing, and attend Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Instructor Demo: Fetch GitHub Issues (5 min)

* Open `05-Fetch-GitHub-Issues/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑  When we open this page, we are able to search for a particular GitHub user and see a list of any repositories.

  * 🔑  We can also see the number of issues for the different repositories.

  * 🔑  We can get this information by making use of URL search parameters and pagination.

  * 🔑  As you can probably deduce, we can iterate through the different repositories in code to get the number of issues for each repository.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * 🙋 How could we handle a user who clicks on a repository that has no issues?
  
  * ☝ We could check the length of the array to see if it's empty and then display a message to the user.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 10. Student Do: Fetch GitHub Issues (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `05-Nested-API-Calls/README.md`, which are also shown here:

  ```md
  # 📐 Add Comments to Implementation of Git It Done Application

  Work with a partner to add comments that describe the functionality of the code found in [single.js](./Unsolved/assets/js/single.js).

  ## 📝 Notes

  Refer to the documentation:

  * [GitHub API documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api)

  ---

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * For an open source contributor, what is the significance of knowing whether an issue has an associated pull request or not?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 11. Instructor Review: Fetch GitHub Issues (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with an application scaled out like this? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use Office Hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ URL search params

  * ✔️ API response pagination

  * ✔️ Nothing to display

* Open `05-Fetch-GitHub-Issues/Solved/assets/js/single.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We retrieve the repository name from the URL in `getRepoName()` so that we can use it in a `fetch()` request.

    ```js
    var queryString = document.location.search;
    var repoName = queryString.split('=')[1];
    ```

  * If there is no repo name in the URL, then let's send the user back to the homepage.

    ```js
    document.location.replace('./index.html');
    ```

  * 🔑 Because GitHub only returns 30 issues at a time, we should check whether there are more than 30 and let users know about it. As shown in the following example, GitHub alerts us with a `Link` property in the response header that gives us the next query URL, in case we want to display the next 30 issues.

    ```js
    if (response.headers.get('Link')) {
      displayWarning(repo);
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 If we search a repository that has no issues, instead of displaying a blank screen, we should let users know with the following code in `displayIssues()`.

    ```js
    if (issues.length === 0) {
      issueContainerEl.textContent = 'This repo has no open issues!';
      return;
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why would GitHub limit its API response size to 30 issues?

  * 🙋 If a server were to respond with all possible data, it could impact the performance of the request and slow down the application.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material and attend Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 12. Recap & Promote Additional Resources (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What do you think you absolutely need to know to succeed at the Challenge?

  * 🙋 How to handle the API request response in a fetch function with the `then()` promise.

  * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

  * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's unnecessary to know anything completely to be successful.

  * ☝️  Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material prior to class as possible?

  * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the Challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

* Direct students to the additional resources available to them:

  * Reflection and Retrieval

  * Career Connection

  * Dessert Menu

### 13. Introduce Group Project (5 min)

* Announce the project groups.

  * Encourage the groups to set up a time this weekend to brainstorm project ideas.

  * Project ideas will be approved by the instructor by next week's first virtual class in Module 07.

* Go over project requirements.

  * Add the [project requirements](../../01-Class-Content/06-Server-Side-APIs/04-Supplemental/Project-Requirements.md) to the student-facing repo and go over them briefly. They are also shown here for your reference:

    ```md
    # Project Requirements

    * Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.

    * Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

    * Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

    * Use at least two server-side APIs.

    * Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).

    * Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

    * Be responsive.

    * Have a polished UI.

    * Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

    * Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

    * Finally, you must add your project to the portfolio that you created in Module 2.

    **More details about the project will be provided in the lessons for Module 7 in Canvas.**
    ```

* Let students know detailed project information will be given in the async material for Module 7.

* Since this is the first time the students will be working collaboratively, they will learn agile development methodologies and implement feature and bug fixes using the Git branch workflow and pull requests.

* Next week's first virtual class will cover agile methodologies, so it is **very important** that everyone attends.
