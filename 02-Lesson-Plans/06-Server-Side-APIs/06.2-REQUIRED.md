# Module 06 Required Session Lesson Plan: Server Side APIs

## Overview 

During this lesson we will teach students how to take user input and to make specific API calls, they will use multiple query params, and they will also use some nested API calls. This is all material covered throughout their module, but these activities will help reinforce these key topics that will be in the forefront of their module challenge.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Use user input to make specific API calls

* Use multiple query params in a single API call

* Use nested API calls

## Preparing For Class/Instructor Notes 

* When reviewing activities, ask for volunteers to share their solutions and/or ask students to walk through the solution, line-by-line.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, share your struggle and/or personal experiences learning and working with the concepts covered in this lesson.

* The topics covered in this class are a bit more complex than the recommended session, so be prepared to answer any questions pertaining to the activities to be completed.

* As always, documentation is your friend. Most importantly, be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try and anticipate questions students may have.

* @TODO reference to async

* Remind TAs to post on Slack the Friday morning before, with a quick message reminding students about the upcoming Saturday session.

## Pre-Class Activity/Warm-Up 

Encourage students to work on the remaining module algorithm(s) during office hours. Review the solutions to the algorithm(s) 5 or 10 minutes before class begins or during office hours after class.
