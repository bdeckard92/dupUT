# Module 06 Instructor Overview: Server-Side APIs

## Overview

In this module, students will learn how to retrieve data from third-party servers and use the Fetch API to make requests to server-side APIs.

In this week's virtual classes, you'll discuss using `fetch()` to make requests to APIs and using plain JavaScript to display the responses to the browser. You'll also cover implementing user input to make specific API calls, using multiple query params in a single API call, and using nested API calls. During this week's second virtual class, you'll announce the upcoming group project and the group members.

| Day  | Topic              | Location   |
| ---  | ---                | ---        |
| 1    | Console Fetch      | 6.1        |
| 1    | Display Response   | 6.1, 6.2   |
| 2    | GIF Search         | 6.3        |
| 2    | Query Params       | 6.4        |
| 2    | Nested API Calls   | 6.2        |

## Overview of Asynchronous Material 

Why are students learning server-side APIs?

* Server-side APIs allow students to build fully functional web applications by pulling in new data from different providers.

* Server-side APIs are widely used to perform a variety of data retrieval tasks, like accessing information from third-party services or collecting information from another server within the same organization.

* Server-side APIs introduce students to interacting with data stored on a server, providing students a first glimpse at working with the back end. 

Throughout the async module this week, students will use server-side APIs to do the following:

* Explain the difference between a client-side API and a server-side API.

* Explain the client-server model and the request-response pattern.

* Explain and implement the differences between using `XMLHttpRequest`, jQuery AJAX, and the Fetch API for HTTP GET requests.

* Explain HTTP response codes and handle response metadata using the Fetch API.

* Parse JSON to dynamically generate HTML.

* Explain the benefits and challenges of working with asynchronous JavaScript.

* Explain and implement query string parameters.

**Reminder**: If students need help with an async activity, encourage them to attend Office Hours for help! If you can’t get through all of it, remind them that they can lean on Learning Assistants with the AskBCS bot for more help.

* [Virtual Class 06.2](./06.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* Be prepared to spend class time this week setting up students for success in their first project.

* Review the [project requirements](../../01-Class-Content/06-Server-Side-APIs/04-Supplemental/Project-Requirements.md) to prepare for any questions that students might have. 

* Encourage students to use this week to think about project ideas. If you're comfortable doing so, share your personal experiences or struggles working on group projects, either in a class or in the workplace, early in your career. 

* Start thinking about project groups. Assign three students per group: one advanced, one average, one struggling.

* Students should install the [JSON Formatter Google Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=en) before class. 

### Common Pain Points

According to our class data, students might experience some of the following pain points throughout the week:

| Pain Point                          | Recommendation       |
| ---                                 | ---                  |
| Fetch API                           | Refer to Lesson 1 or the [MDN Web Docs on Using Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) |
| HTTP GET requests | Refer to Lesson 2 or the [MDN Web Docs on XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest)|

## Career Connection

During each lesson that students work through, they will also view a Career Connection section that will tie together the academic content with career services and how this material will be applicable to them in their future career.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Coach and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp).

If you'd like more information on career services, visit the [career services resources page](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp).

## Module Challenge

In this week's Challenge, students will build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. Students will use the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve weather data for cities and use `localStorage` to store any persistent data.

[Module 06 Challenge](../../01-Class-Content/06-Server-Side-APIs/02-Challenge)

Specific skills students will need to implement in order to be successful:

* Send requests to a server-side API using the Fetch API.

* Receive and parse data in the JSON format.

* Dynamically generate HTML using returned data.

* Handle response codes and metadata, including headers, status, and URL.

## Heads-Up

* Students will start working on their group project next week, so they must be assigned into groups and start talking about project ideas within their groups by this weekend.

* Be prepared to intervene and help groups that are struggling to identify a project idea or plan.  

* The first virtual class next week is crucial because it introduces agile project management and sets students up for success as a team. Remind students that it is important to attend this class and actively participate in group planning and implementation throughout the project.
