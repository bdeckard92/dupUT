# Module 06 Instructor Overview: Server-Side APIs

## Overview

In this module, students will learn how to retrieve data from third-party servers and use the Fetch API to make requests to server-side APIs.

In this week's virtual classes, you'll discuss using `fetch()` to make requests to APIs and using plain JavaScript to display the responses to the browser. You will also cover using user input to make specific API calls, using multiple query params in a single API call, and using nested API calls.

| Day  | Topic              | Location   |
| ---  | ---                | ---        |
| 1    | Console Fetch      | 6.1        |
| 1    | Display Response   | 6.1, 6.2   |
| 2    | GIF Search         | 6.3        |
| 2    | Query Params       | 6.4        |
| 2    | Nested API Calls   | 6.2        |

## Overview of Asynchronous Material 

Why are students learning Server-Side APIs?

* Server-Side APIs allow students to build fully functional web applications by pulling in new data from different providers.

* Server-Side APIs are widely used at companies to perform a variety of data retrieval tasks, from accessing information from third-party services to collecting information from another server in their own organization.

* AJAX is an in-demand skill. 

Throughout the async module this week, students will use Server-Side APIs to do the following:

* Explain the difference between a client-side API and a server-side API

* Explain the client-server model and request-response pattern

* Explain and implement the differences between HTTP GET requests using XMLHTTPRequest, jQuery AJAX, and the fetch API

* Explain HTTP response codes and handle response metadata with fetch API

* Parse JSON to dynamically generate HTML

* Explain the benefits and challenges of working with asynchronous JavaScript

* Explain and implement query string parameters

**Reminder:** If students need help with an async activity, encourage them to attend Office Hours for help! If you can’t get through all of it, remind them that they can lean on Learning Assistants with the AskBCS bot for more help.

## Virtual Classes

If your class started AFTER January 1, 2021, use these lesson plans:

* [Virtual Class 06.1](./06.1-REQUIRED.md)

* [Virtual Class 06.2](./06.2-REQUIRED.md)

If your class started BEFORE January 1, 2021, use these lesson plans:

* [Virtual Class (Recommended) 06.1](./06.1-RECOMMENDED.md)

* [Virtual Class (Required) 06.2](./06.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* Be prepared to spend time during this week's classes setting the students up for success for their first projects.

* Look over the [project requirements](../../01-Class-Content/06-Server-Side-APIs/04-Supplemental/Project-Requirements.md) to prepare for any questions students may have. 

* Encourage students to use this week to think about project ideas and if you are comfortable doing so, share your struggle and/or personal experiences learning and working on your first projects in a group setting either in a class or in the workplace. 

* Think about how you can group the students into groups of three and plan to have groups assigned before the end of the week. Each group should be a mix of excelling and emerging students.

* Students will need and want to install [JSON Formatter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=en) prior to class. 

### Common Pain Points

According to our class data, students might experience some of the following pain points throughout the week:

| Pain Point                          | Recommendation       |
| ---                                 | ---                  |
| Fetch API                           | Refer to Lesson 1 or [MDN documentation on Using Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) |
| HTTP GET requests | Refer to Lesson XX or [MDN documentation on XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest)|

## Career Connection

During each lesson that students work through, they will also view a Career Connection section that will tie together the academic content with Career Services and how this material will be applicable to them in their future career.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Director and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careerservicesonlineevents.splashthat.com/).

If you'd like more information on Career Services, visit the [Career Services resources page](https://mycareerspot.org/).

## Module Challenge

In this week's Challenge, students will build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

Students will use the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve weather data for cities and localStorage to store any persistent data.

[Module 06 Challenge](../../01-Class-Content/06-Server-Side-APIs/02-Challenge)

Specific skills students will need to implement in order to be successful:

* Use the fetch API to send requests to a server-side API

* Receive and parse data in the JSON format

* Use returned data to dynamically generate HTML

* Handle response codes and metadata, including headers, status, and URL

## Heads-Up

* Next week, students will start working on their first group project. Students should already be assigned into groups and be discussing and finalizing project ideas within their groups prior to the first virtual class. As a reminder, groups of three are ideal and it is important to structure groups so that each group consists of a mix of students who are excelling and emerging. If needed, one or two groups can have four if the class cannot be divided by three.

* Please be prepared to step in and help groups who may be struggling to identify a project idea or plan.  

* The first virtual class next week is **very important** because it introduces agile project management and sets the students up for success as a team. Please remind students that it is important to attend and be an active participant in group planning and implementation throughout the project.
