# Module 06 Instructor Overview: Server-Side APIs

## Overview

In this week's virtual classes, you'll review using `fetch()` to make requests to APIs and using plain JavaScript to display the responses to the browser. You will also review using user input to make specific API calls, using multiple query params in a single API call, and using nested API calls.

You will also announce the upcoming group project and the group members during this week's second virtual class.

## Virtual Classes

If your class started **AFTER** January 1, 2021, use these lesson plans:

* [Virtual Class 06.1](./06.1-REQUIRED.md)

* [Virtual Class 06.2](./06.2-REQUIRED.md)

If your class started **BEFORE** January 1, 2021, use these lesson plans:

* [Virtual Class (Recommended) 06.1](./06.1-RECOMMENDED.md)

* [Virtual Class (Required) 06.2](./06.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* Information about the upcoming group project must go out during this week's second virtual class!

  * Start thinking about project groups. Assign 3 students per group: one advanced, one average, one struggling.  

  * Look over the [project requirements](../../01-Class-Content/06-Server-Side-APIs/04-Supplemental/Project-Requirements.md). 

* `fetch()` is a fairly simple topic, but being this is new to students be prepared for questions on syntax or basic errors.

* Students will need and want to install [JSON Formatter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=en) prior to class. 

## Career Connection

During each lesson that students work through, they will also view a Career Connection section that will tie together the academic content with Career Services and how this material will be applicable to them in their future career.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Director and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careerservicesonlineevents.splashthat.com/).

If you'd like more information on Career Services, visit the [Career Services resources page](https://mycareerspot.org/).

## Heads-Up

* Next week, students will start working on their group project. Before this weekend, students must be assigned into groups and be talking about project ideas within their groups.

* Also, next week's first virtual class is **very important** because it will cover agile project management, so strongly encourage the students to attend.
