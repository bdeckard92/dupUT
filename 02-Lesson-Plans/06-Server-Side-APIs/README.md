# Module 06 Instructor Overview: Server Side APIs

## Overview

In this week's virtual classes, you'll review using fetch to make requests to APIs and using vanilla JavaScript to display the responses to the browser. You will also review using user input to make specific API calls, using multiple query params in a single API call, and using nested API calls.

You will also announce the upcoming group project and the group members.
