# Module 06 Instructor Overview: Server Side APIs

## Overview

In this week's virtual classes, you'll review using fetch to make requests to APIs and using vanilla JavaScript to display the responses to the browser. You will also review using user input to make specific API calls, using multiple query params in a single API call, and using nested API calls.

You will also announce the upcoming group project and the group members during the Required Class.

### [Required Class](./06.2-REQUIRED.md)


## Instructor Notes

* During this week's Required Class, information about the upcoming group project must go out!

  * Start thinking about project groups. Assign 3 students per group: one advanced, one average, one struggling.  

  * Go over the [project requirements](01-Class-Content/06-Server-Side-APIs/04-Supplemental/Project-Requirements.md). 

* Fetch is a fairly simple topic, but being this is new to students be prepared for questions on syntax or basic errors.

* Students will need and want to install [JSON Formatter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=en) prior to class.

## Heads-Up

Next week, students will start working on their group project. So before this weekend, students must be assigned into groups and be talking about project ideas within their groups.

Also, next week's Recommended Class is very important because it will cover agile project management, so strongly encourage the students to attend.
