# Module 06 Virtual Class: Server-Side APIs

## Overview 

In today's virtual class, students will practice using `fetch()` and displaying the responses to the browser. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Use `fetch()` to make requests to APIs

* Use vanilla JavaScript to display responses to the browser

## Instructor Notes

* Use the introduction to gauge student comprehension of the material. A Fist to Five activity is scripted below, but feel free to make an assessment using other means, such as a poll.

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate questions students may have.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* When reviewing activities, ask for volunteers to share their solutions and/or ask students to walk through the solution line-by-line.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, share your struggles and/or personal experiences learning and working with the concepts covered in this lesson.

* `Fetch` is a fairly simple topic, but this is new to students so be prepared for questions on syntax or basic errors.

* In Lesson 1 of the async material, students are introduced to `fetch()`, public APIs, and how to display the response.

## Class Instruction 

### 1. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Invite students to post questions in the Zoom chat so TAs and/or the instructor can address them at the end of class.

* Open the [Slide Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hrJFo5_NZzWlcXWgJyMUymoJWt2dDW1uxKy_FLhfeQE/edit?usp=sharing) and walk through the following slides on foundation setting: 

    **Big Picture**: This is an opportunity to zoom out and look at the big picture of where students are in the course. Take a moment to discuss a few real-world examples of why this week's topics are valuable.

    **Boot Camp Pointers**: Review some logistics that will help students stay on track. This is an opportunity to speak to what students might need at this particular point in the course. 

    **This Week**: Review the key skills students will be learning this week. 

    **This Week's Assignment**: Give a quick summary of this week's Challenge assignment and describe how the skills they learn throughout the week will be applied to it.

    **Career Connection**: Reinforce that students will use the skills they learn this week throughout their careers. It's important for them to know the "why" and "how" behind the "what." Give examples of how these skills are used on the job. If you feel comfortable, share examples of how you have used them in your professional career.

    * Students are now intensely focused on understanding JavaScript, Web APIs, third-party APIs, and server-side APIs. It's a lot for them absorb. With this might come forgetting how important it is to keep on top of Career Services content&mdash;after all, the goal is a new career, right?

    * Remind students to complete the employer-ready and employer-competitive tasks assigned to them in the weekly Career Connection:

        * Build a small application: With your new skills, you may be tempted to incorporate external data in your existing portfolio, like displaying today's weather. Why not take things a step further? Try building a small application that's enticing to prospective employers. For example, you could build a dynamic weather app that uses the browser API to get the user's location, then makes a request to an external API to display the weather. Be sure to push the final page to GitHub, get a live site going, and write a fully formed README file.

        * Add AJAX as a skill on your resume: The Technical Skills section of your resume should now proudly display AJAX next to JavaScript. This is a big deal because companies make server calls to APIs all the time!

    * Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

        * ☝️ Why should we bother adding skills like AJAX to our resume?

        * 🙋 When you apply to jobs at larger companies, they'll often run your resume through something called an Applicant Tracking System (ATS), which matches keywords with job descriptions and automatically filters out candidates.

        * ☝️ Exactly! And can anybody think of another place where we should really think about the keywords and skills we might add?

        * 🙋 LinkedIn! LinkedIn is a great place for recruiters and HR managers to find potential employees—these searches usually start by dropping keywords into the search function. Therefore, it's important to have a clean headline and skills section that details all the skills and interests you have.
  
    **How to Succeed This Week**: Remind students that they might experience moments of frustration as they learn complex concepts and tools, and that these times are actually proven opportunities to deepen knowledge. Consider sharing something about your personal learning journey. This helps students recognize that everyone starts somewhere and that they are not alone.

    **Today's Objectives**: Outline the concepts that will be covered in today's lesson. Remind students that they can find the relevant activity files in the "Getting Ready for Class" page in their course content. 

### 2. Instructor Do: Student Check-In (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

  * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back and see what we accomplished and acknowledge that it is a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic?

  * 🙋 Let's do Fist to Five together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 3. Instructor Demo: Console Fetch (5 min) 

* Open `01-Fetch/Solved/assets/js/index.html` in your browser, open the console, and demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 This application makes a `fetch` request to the Giphy API.

    * 🔑 The response from the API is logged in the console.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 In the async material, we made a request to the GitHub API using `fetch` and `curl` in Lesson 1.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We will need to make `fetch` requests to complete the challenge.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We would simply use standard `fetch` syntax to make a request to the API, and console log our response to start.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Console Fetch (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-Fetch/README.md`.

```md
# Console Fetch

In this activity, you will create a fetch request and log the response in the console.

## Instructions

* Open the [script.js](Unsolved/assets/js/script.js) file and create a fetch request to the Giphy API.

    * Use this URL and API key: `https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/trending?api_key=HvaacROi9w5oQCDYHSIk42eiDSIXH3FN`

* Then log the response in the console.

## Hint(s)

* You can refer to the [MDN Docs on Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).
```

### 5. Instructor Review: Console Fetch (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points (:key:) below to review the following key points (✔️):

    * ✔️ `fetch('url')`

    * ✔️ `.then()`

* Open `01-Fetch/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 We write a request using the `fetch(url)` syntax. When making a request to Giphy we need to be sure to put our API key at the end.

    ```js
    fetch('https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/trending?api_key=HvaacROi9w5oQCDYHSIk42eiDSIXH3FN')
    ```

    * 🔑 We `.then()` take our response and convert it to `json()`.

    ```js
    .then(function(response) {
        return response.json();
    })
    ```

    * 🔑 Finally we chain another `.then()` function and `console.log` our response.

    ```js
    .then(function(data) {
        console.log(data);
    });
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What does `fetch` allow us to do?

    * 🙋 `fetch` allows us to make API requests via JS.

    * ☝️ Why do we need an API key?

    * 🙋 Most APIs require an API key, and that's a key that will get passed to their API to authorize access. This helps APIs limit requests.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't totally understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 1, read the [MDN Documentation on Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Display Response (5 min) 

* Open `02-Response/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 When the page loads, we see a GIF.

    * 🔑 Every time we refresh the page, a random GIF now loads!

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 In Lesson 1, students used `fetch` to send a request to the GitHub API and get a user's repos. 

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We will need to use `fetch` and display responses from APIs on our pages.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 After receiving responses from our API, all we need to do is use some JavaScript to display these responses to the page.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Display Response (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Response/README.md`.

    ```md
    # Display Response

    In this activity, you will take the response from the fetch request and display the GIF in the browser.

    ## Instructions

    * Open the [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) file and examine the ID's and class names of the HTML elements. This will be important for DOM manipulation later.

    * Open the [script.js](Unsolved/assets/js/script.js) file and follow the directions in the comments to display the GIF on the page.

    * Use DOM manipulation to create HTML elements and append them to the page. 

    ## Hint(s)

    * You can refer to the [DOM Docs on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents)
    ```

### 8. Instructor Review: Display Response (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points (:key:) below to review the following key points (✔️):

    * ✔️ DOM Manipulation to display response

* Open `02-Response/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * We write a fetch request to Giphy, using the `random` endpoint so we only receive one response. We could use other endpoints, but then we would need to loop through the response.

    ```js
    fetch('https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/random?api_key=HvaacROi9w5oQCDYHSIk42eiDSIXH3FN')
    ```

    * We `.then()` convert the response to JSON with `.json()`.

    ```js
    .then(function(response) {
        return response.json();
    });
    ```

    * 🔑 We will then do some DOM manipulation to display the response. We will first grab the ID via `document.querySelector`.

    ```js
    var responseContainerEl = document.querySelector("#response-container")
    ```

    * Next, we create an `<img>` element, and then set its `src` attribute to be equal to `response.data.image_url` from our API response. 

    ```js
    var gifImg = document.createElement("img");
    gifImg.setAttribute("src", response.data.image_url)
    ```

    * Finally we will take the `responseContainerEl` and append the `gifImg` we created to it.

    ```js
    responseContainerEl.appendChild(gifImg)
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How do API calls and DOM manipulation come together to help us?

    * 🙋 We are now able to take responses from our API calls and display those results to the browser however we like.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understanding this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 1, read the [DOM Docs on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

    * 🙋 We covered `fetch` and how we can display responses from our fetches to the browser!

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's unnecessary to know anything completely to be successful. 

    * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material as possible?

    * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

    * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

    * 🙋 In Lesson 1 a `fetch` request is made to the GitHub API. Students can refer back to this lesson if they would like to recap that material.

    * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Use student answers to transition to office hours.

### 10. Office Hours (30 min)

* Announce Office Hours and invite students to stay on the Zoom and start the challenge while they have live support from instructional staff.
