# 06.1 Virtual Class: Server-Side APIs

## Overview

In today's virtual class, students will practice using `fetch()` and displaying the responses to the browser.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Use `fetch()` to make requests to APIs.

* Parse JSON responses from `fetch()` requests.

## Instructor Notes

* Use the introduction to gauge student comprehension of the material. A Fist to Five activity is scripted below, but feel free to make an assessment using other means, such as a poll.

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly, ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity, and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* When reviewing activities, ask for volunteers to share their solutions and/or ask students to walk through the solution line by line.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* If you are comfortable doing so, share your struggles and/or personal experiences learning and working with the concepts covered in this lesson.

* `Fetch` is a fairly simple topic, but this is new to students so be prepared for questions on syntax or basic errors.

* Explain to students that `fetch()` is an API that allows you to pass additional headers, request parameters, and even a body to the server. However, in these exercises, we will use the `fetch()` API to make simple GET requests to a server.

* In Lesson 1 of the async material, students are introduced to `fetch()`, public APIs, and how to display the response.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Invite students to post questions in the Zoom chat so TAs and/or the instructor can address them at the end of class.

* Open the lesson [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hrJFo5_NZzWlcXWgJyMUymoJWt2dDW1uxKy_FLhfeQE/edit?usp=sharing) and walk through the following slides on foundation setting:

    **Big Picture**: This is an opportunity to zoom out and look at the big picture of where students are in the course. Take a moment to discuss a few real-world examples of why this week's topics are valuable.

    **Boot Camp Pointers**: Review some logistics that will help students stay on track. This is an opportunity to speak to what students might need at this particular point in the course.

    **This Week**: Review the key skills students will be learning this week.

    **This Week's Assignment**: Give a quick summary of this week's Challenge assignment and describe how the skills they learn throughout the week will be applied to it.

    **Career Connection**: Reinforce that students will use the skills they learn this week throughout their careers. It's important for them to know the "why" and "how" behind the "what." Give examples of how these skills are used on the job. If you feel comfortable, share examples of how you have used them in your professional career.

    * Students are now intensely focused on understanding JavaScript, Web APIs, third-party APIs, and server-side APIs. It's a lot for them absorb. With this might come forgetting how important it is to keep on top of career services content -- after all, the goal is a new career, right?

    * Remind students to complete the employer-ready and employer-competitive tasks assigned to them in the weekly Career Connection, including the following:

      * Build a small application: With your new skills, you may be tempted to incorporate external data in your existing portfolio, like displaying today's weather. Why not take things a step further? Try to build a small application that's enticing to prospective employers. For example, you could build a dynamic weather app that uses the browser API to get the user's location and then makes a request to an external API to display the weather. Be sure to push the final page to GitHub, get a live site going, and write a high-quallity README file.

      * Add AJAX as a skill on your resume: The Technical Skills section of your resume should now proudly display AJAX next to JavaScript. This is a big deal because companies make server calls to APIs all the time!

    * Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

      * ‚òùÔ∏è Why should we bother adding skills like AJAX to our resume?

      * üôã When you apply to jobs at larger companies, they'll often run your resume through something called an Applicant Tracking System (ATS), which matches keywords with job descriptions and automatically filters out candidates.

      * ‚òùÔ∏è Exactly! And can anybody think of another place where we should really think about the keywords and skills we might add?

      * üôã LinkedIn! LinkedIn is a great place for recruiters and HR managers to find potential employees. These searches typically start by using keywords in the search function. Therefore, it's important to have a clean headline and skills section that details all the skills and interests you have.

    **How to Succeed This Week**: Remind students that they might experience moments of frustration as they learn complex concepts and tools, and that these times are actually proven opportunities to deepen knowledge. Consider sharing something about your personal learning journey. This helps students recognize that everyone starts somewhere and that they are not alone.

    **Today's Agenda**: Outline the concepts that will be covered in today's lesson. Remind students that they can find the relevant activity files in the "Getting Ready for Class" page in their course content.

### 2. Instructor Do: Student Check-In (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How are you feeling about your progress so far?

  * üôã We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back at what we accomplished and acknowledge that it is a lot. It‚Äôs also okay to feel overwhelmed -- as long as we don‚Äôt give up!

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with this topic?

  * üôã Let's do Fist to Five together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 3. Instructor Demo: Create Fetch (5 min)

* Open `01-Create-Fetch/Solved/index.html` in your browser, open the console, and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë After you click the "Fetch Your User Repos" button, a fetch request is sent to GitHub's API to retrieve a user's repositories.

  * üîë The response from the API is then used to populate the unordered list of repositories on the page.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What do we need to pass through fetch() to get an API to send back data?

  * üôã We need a proper endpoint which can be found using the GitHub API documentation.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How is a request like this useful?

  * üôã GitHub makes a lot of their API endpoints available for use in other applications.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Create Fetch (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-Create-Fetch/README.md`, which are also shown here:

  ```md
  # üèóÔ∏è Implement a fetch() Request to Display User Repositories

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a user, I want to see a list of my GitHub repositories.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It is done when I click the "Fetch Your User Repos" button, and a list of my GitHub repositories displays on the page.

  ## Assets

  The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

  ![The webpage shows a user's GitHub repositories when the button is selected.](./Images/01-solution-screenshot.png)

  ---

  ## üí° Hints

  * How can we use the [GitHub API documentation on repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#list-repositories-for-a-user) to support this implementation?

  * Where in the URL string is the repository endpoint added?

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * In `fetch()` requests we use the URL. What is the difference between a URL and URI?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 5. Instructor Review: Create Fetch (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel creating a Fetch request? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use Office Hours to get extra help.

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Root endpoint + path  = endpoint

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `/users/octocat/repos`

* Open `01-Create-Fetch/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We create a function called `getApi`.

    ```js
    function getApi() {
    ```

  * üîë We save the full endpoint that we would like to make a request to in a variable called `requestUrl`, replacing `octocat` with the username that we want to search for.

    ```js
    var requestUrl = 'https://api.github.com/users/octocat/repos';
    ```

  * We then pass the `requestUrl` variable as an argument to the `fetch()` method.

    ```js
    fetch(requestUrl)
    ```

  * We convert the response into JSON. Lastly, we `return` the JSON-formatted response.

    ```js
    .then(function (response) {
      return response.json();
    })
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How do we build the `requestURL`?

  * üôã We attach the desired endpoint to the root endpoint. We can also attach additional parameters to the URL, as in the following example:

    ```md
    https://api.github.com/users/octocat/repos?page=2
    ```

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [GitHub API documentation on repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos), and read the [MDN Web Docs on fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Parsing JSON (5 min)

* Open `02-Parse-JSON/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë When the page loads, we see some instructions to make a request to get five GitHub issues associated with Twitter's Chill repo.

  * üîë We are then asked to loop through the response and `console.log()` each issue's URL and user's login.

  * üîë The response we receive is an array, meaning that we can loop through the data, accessing whatever specific data we want.

  * üîë We can see the results by opening the DevTools console in the browser.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How can we iterate over an array of data?

  * üôã We can use a `for` loop, just like always!

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What should we do before we use the data from an API response?

  * üôã We need to convert the response into JSON. We can do this by calling `response.json()`.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Parsing JSON (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Parse-JSON/README.md`, which are also shown here:

  ```md
  # üìñ Implement a `fetch()` Request to Log Repository Issues

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to log issues from Twitter's Chill repository.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It is done when I open Chrome DevTools, and five issues from the Chill repository are logged in the console.

  * It is done when the issue's URL and username are logged in the DevTools console.

  ## üìù Notes

  Refer to the documentation:

  [GitHub API documentation on listing repository issues](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/issues#list-repository-issues)

  ---

  ## üí° Hints

  How do you add parameters to an API endpoint URL?

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * We connect to these API servers through DNS, but they are attached to an IP address. How does this work?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 8. Instructor Review: Parsing JSON (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with reading documentation? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use Office Hours to get extra help.

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Response limits

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Parameters dictate responses

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Documentation for parameters

* Navigate to the [GitHub documentation on listing repository issues](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/issues#list-repository-issues), and explain the following:

  * Scroll to the parameters list. We can use the `per_page` parameter to limit the amount of data that comes back in the response.

* Open `02-Parse-JSON/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * üîë We add the `per_page` parameter to the end of the `requestUrl` variable and set the parameter to `5`.

    ```js
    var requestUrl = 'https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/node/issues?per_page=5';
    ```

  * üîë We pass the completed `requestUrl` variable as an argument to the `fetch()`. On completion of the request, we convert the response to JSON in the return.

    ```js
    fetch(requestUrl)
    .then(function (response) {
      return response.json();
    })
    ```

  * üîë We loop through the data and console log the properties from the API response. We use dot notation on the `data` iterator, logging the `.url` and `.user.login` properties.

    ```js
    .then(function (data) {
        for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
            .log('Github Repo Issues \n----------');
            console.log(data[i].url);
            console.log(data[i].user.login);
        }
    });
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Where are parameters added to an endpoint?

  * üôã They are normally chained on the end of the endpoint URL.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Where do we find a list of parameters for a given endpoint?

  * üôã It can almost always be found on the documentation page.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [GitHub documentation on the REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest), and attend Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Everyone Do: Git (30 min)

* Open the [GitHub guide on collaboration flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) in your browser and explain the following:

  * When multiple developers collaborate on a single project, establishing a workflow that everyone agrees on is crucial to success.

  * The typical workflow consists of each developer creating their own branches to work on separate parts of the application, pushing that branch up and opening a pull request, reviewing that pull request, and ultimately merging the updated code into `main`.

  * Communication around a project is as important as the actual code being written. No developer should autonomously make decisions that affect the product without the input and review of the other developers.

* Divide students into breakout rooms. Because the first part of this activity is a group-based activity, **only one person** in the group needs to make the repository for this activity. That person will invite the other developers to join the repo as a collaborator once they have everything set up.

* Students may get merge conflicts when they each open their PRs against the `main` branch with the same `README.md`modified. If this is the case, have the group merge one PR at a time while the others pull in the current `main` branch into their branches after each merge.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `Git-Guide/README.md`.

* While everyone is working on the activity, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

* If time allows, set up this demonstration yourself, with other instructional staff or students as collaborators, and walk through the guide to demonstrate the following:

  * After creating the repository, it's best that the repository owner creates some of the boilerplate files such as the `.gitignore` file.

  * In the repository settings, we make it so that no new code can be merged into the `main` branch without at least one other reviewer. This way, no one on a team can autonomously merge code into production.

  * We can also add collaborators directly by looking them up and inviting them.

  * When we want to start work on a new feature, we create a new branch, as follows:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b <feature_branch_name>

    # or like this...
    git branch <feature_branch_name>
    git checkout <feature_branch_name>
    ```

  * We do the work, commit and push the branch, and then open a pull request and add the collaborators as reviewers. Because we protected the `main` branch, we need someone else to review and merge for us.

  * The reviewers now have to look at this pull request, review the updates to the project, and either request changes or approve the pull request.

  * When the pull request is merged to `main`, everyone should get their local branches in sync so that all updated code is in place by running `git pull origin main`.

* Explain that the Git and GitHub workflow is not an exact science. It's okay if merge conflicts or errors happen every once in a while. The key to smooth development processes is communication and cooperation among collaborators.

* Answer any questions before proceeding.

### 10. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

  * üôã We covered `fetch` and how we can display responses from our fetches to the browser!

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

  * üôã All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's unnecessary to know any one thing completely to be successful.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material as possible?

  * üôã It's important both to be fully prepared to start the Challenge assignment, and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

  * üôã In Lesson 1, a `fetch` request is made to the GitHub API. Students can refer back to this lesson if they want to recap that material.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Answer any questions before ending the class.
