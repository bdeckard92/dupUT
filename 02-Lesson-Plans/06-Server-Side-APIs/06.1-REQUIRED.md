# 06.1 Virtual Class: Server-Side APIs

## Overview

In today's virtual class, students will practice using `fetch()` and displaying the responses to the browser.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Use `fetch()` to make requests to APIs.

* Parse JSON responses from `fetch()` requests.

## Instructor Notes

* Use the introduction to gauge student comprehension of the material. A Fist to Five activity is scripted below, but feel free to make an assessment using other means, such as a poll.

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly, ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity, and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* When reviewing activities, ask for volunteers to share their solutions and/or ask students to walk through the solution line by line.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* If you are comfortable doing so, share your struggles and/or personal experiences learning and working with the concepts covered in this lesson.

* `Fetch` is a fairly simple topic, but this is new to students so be prepared for questions on syntax or basic errors.

* Explain to students that `fetch()` is an API that allows you to pass additional headers, request parameters, and even a body to the server. However, in these exercises, we will use the `fetch()` API to make simple GET requests to a server.

* In Lesson 1 of the async material, students are introduced to `fetch()`, public APIs, and how to display the response.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Invite students to post questions in the Zoom chat so TAs and/or the instructor can address them at the end of class.

* Open the lesson [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hrJFo5_NZzWlcXWgJyMUymoJWt2dDW1uxKy_FLhfeQE/edit?usp=sharing) and walk through the following slides on foundation setting:

    **Big Picture**: This is an opportunity to zoom out and look at the big picture of where students are in the course. Take a moment to discuss a few real-world examples of why this week's topics are valuable.

    **Boot Camp Pointers**: Review some logistics that will help students stay on track. This is an opportunity to speak to what students might need at this particular point in the course.

    **This Week**: Review the key skills students will be learning this week.

    **This Week's Assignment**: Give a quick summary of this week's Challenge assignment and describe how the skills they learn throughout the week will be applied to it.

    **Career Connection**: Reinforce that students will use the skills they learn this week throughout their careers. It's important for them to know the "why" and "how" behind the "what." Give examples of how these skills are used on the job. If you feel comfortable, share examples of how you have used them in your professional career.

    * Students are now intensely focused on understanding JavaScript, Web APIs, third-party APIs, and server-side APIs. It's a lot for them absorb. With this might come forgetting how important it is to keep on top of career services content -- after all, the goal is a new career, right?

    * Remind students to complete the employer-ready and employer-competitive tasks assigned to them in the weekly Career Connection, including the following:

      * Build a small application: With your new skills, you may be tempted to incorporate external data in your existing portfolio, like displaying today's weather. Why not take things a step further? Try to build a small application that's enticing to prospective employers. For example, you could build a dynamic weather app that uses the browser API to get the user's location and then makes a request to an external API to display the weather. Be sure to push the final page to GitHub, get a live site going, and write a high-quallity README file.

      * Add AJAX as a skill on your resume: The Technical Skills section of your resume should now proudly display AJAX next to JavaScript. This is a big deal because companies make server calls to APIs all the time!

    * Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

      * ☝️ Why should we bother adding skills like AJAX to our resume?

      * 🙋 When you apply to jobs at larger companies, they'll often run your resume through something called an Applicant Tracking System (ATS), which matches keywords with job descriptions and automatically filters out candidates.

      * ☝️ Exactly! And can anybody think of another place where we should really think about the keywords and skills we might add?

      * 🙋 LinkedIn! LinkedIn is a great place for recruiters and HR managers to find potential employees. These searches typically start by using keywords in the search function. Therefore, it's important to have a clean headline and skills section that details all the skills and interests you have.
  
    **How to Succeed This Week**: Remind students that they might experience moments of frustration as they learn complex concepts and tools, and that these times are actually proven opportunities to deepen knowledge. Consider sharing something about your personal learning journey. This helps students recognize that everyone starts somewhere and that they are not alone.

    **Today's Agenda**: Outline the concepts that will be covered in today's lesson. Remind students that they can find the relevant activity files in the "Getting Ready for Class" page in their course content.

### 2. Instructor Do: Student Check-In (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

  * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back at what we accomplished and acknowledge that it is a lot. It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed -- as long as we don’t give up!

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic?

  * 🙋 Let's do Fist to Five together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 3. Instructor Demo: Create Fetch (5 min)

* Open `01-Create_Fetch/Solved/index.html` in your browser, open the console, and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 After you click the "Fetch Your User Repos" button, a fetch request is sent to GitHub's API to retrieve a user's repositories.

  * 🔑 The response from the API is then used to populate the unordered list of repositories on the page.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What do we need to pass through fetch() to get an API to send back data?

  * 🙋 We need a proper endpoint which can be found using the GitHub API documentation.

  * ☝️ How is a request like this useful?

  * 🙋 GitHub makes a lot of their API endpoints available for use in other applications.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Create Fetch (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-Create_Fetch/README.md`, which are also shown here:

  ```md
  # 🏗️ Implement a fetch() Request to Display User Repositories

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a user, I want to see a list of my GitHub repositories.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It is done when I click the "Fetch Your User Repos" button, and a list of my GitHub repositories displays on the page.

  ## Assets

  The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

  ![The webpage shows a user's GitHub repositories when the button is selected.](./Images/01-solution-screenshot.png)

  ---

  ## 💡 Hints

  * How can we use the [GitHub API documentation on repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#list-repositories-for-a-user) to support this implementation?

  * Where in the URL string is the repository endpoint added?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * In `fetch()` requests we use the URL. What is the difference between a URL and URI?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 5. Instructor Review: Create Fetch (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel creating a Fetch request? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use Office Hours to get extra help.

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ Root endpoint + path  = endpoint

  * ✔️ `/users/octocat/repos`

* Open `02-Create-Fetch/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We create a function called `getApi`.

    ```js
    function getApi() {
    ```

  * 🔑 We save the full endpoint that we would like to make a request to in a variable called `requestUrl`, replacing `octocat` with the username that we want to search for.

    ```js
    var requestUrl = 'https://api.github.com/users/octocat/repos';
    ```

  * We then pass the `requestUrl` variable as an argument to the `fetch()` method.

    ```js
    fetch(requestUrl)
    ```

  * We convert the response into JSON. Lastly, we `return` the JSON-formatted response.

    ```js
    .then(function (response) {
      return response.json();
    })
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How do we build the `requestURL`?

  * 🙋 We attach the desired endpoint to the root endpoint. We can also attach additional parameters to the URL, as in the following example:

    ```md
    https://api.github.com/users/octocat/repos?page=2
    ```

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [GitHub API documentation on repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos), and read the [MDN Web Docs on fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Parsing JSON (5 min)

* Open `02-Parse-JSON/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 When the page loads, we see some instructions to make a request to get five GitHub issues associated with Twitter's Chill repo.

  * 🔑 We are then asked to loop through the response and `console.log()` each issue's URL and user's login.

  * 🔑 The response we receive is an array, meaning that we can loop through the data, accessing whatever specific data we want.

  * 🔑 We can see the results by opening the DevTools console in the browser.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How can we iterate over an array of data?

  * 🙋 We can use a `for` loop, just like always!

  * ☝️ What should we do before we use the data from an API response?

  * 🙋 We need to convert the response into JSON. We can do this by calling `response.json()`.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Parsing JSON (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Parse_JSON/README.md`, which are also shown here:

  ```md
  # 📖 Implement a `fetch()` Request to Log Repository Issues

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to log issues from Twitter's Chill repository.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It is done when I open Chrome DevTools, and five issues from the Chill repository are logged in the console.

  * It is done when the issue's URL and username are logged in the DevTools console.

  ## 📝 Notes

  Refer to the documentation:

  [GitHub API documentation on listing repository issues](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/issues#list-repository-issues)

  ---

  ## 💡 Hints

  How do you add parameters to an API endpoint URL?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * We connect to these API servers through DNS, but they are attached to an IP address. How does this work?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 8. Instructor Review: Parsing JSON (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with reading documentation? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use Office Hours to get extra help.

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ Response limits

  * ✔️ Parameters dictate responses

  * ✔️ Documentation for parameters

* Navigate to the [GitHub documentation on listing repository issues](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/issues#list-repository-issues), and explain the following:

  * Scroll to the parameters list. We can use the `per_page` parameter to limit the amount of data that comes back in the response.

* Open `02-Parse_JSON/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We add the `per_page` parameter to the end of the `requestUrl` variable and set the parameter to `5`.

    ```js
    var requestUrl = 'https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/node/issues?per_page=5';
    ```

  * 🔑 We pass the completed `requestUrl` variable as an argument to the `fetch()`. On completion of the request, we convert the response to JSON in the return.

    ```js
    fetch(requestUrl)
    .then(function (response) {
      return response.json();
    })
    ```

  * 🔑 We loop through the data and console log the properties from the API response. We use dot notation on the `data` iterator, logging the `.url` and `.user.login` properties.

    ```js
    .then(function (data) {
        for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
            .log('Github Repo Issues \n----------');
            console.log(data[i].url);
            console.log(data[i].user.login);
        }
    });
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where are parameters added to an endpoint?

  * 🙋 They are normally chained on the end of the endpoint URL.

  * ☝️ Where do we find a list of parameters for a given endpoint?

  * 🙋 It can almost always be found on the documentation page.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [GitHub documentation on the REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest), and attend Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

  * 🙋 We covered `fetch` and how we can display responses from our fetches to the browser.

  * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

  * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's unnecessary to know any one thing completely to be successful.

  * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material as possible?

  * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the Challenge assignment, and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

  * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

  * 🙋 In Lesson 1, a `fetch` request is made to the GitHub API. Students can refer back to this lesson if they want to recap that material.

  * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

  * Use student answers to transition to the Challenge Review.

### 10. Challenge Review (30 min)

* Take this time to help get students unblocked on the current Challenge.

* Expect that students may ask for the following:

  * Further review on a particular subject

  * Debugging assistance

  * Help with computer issues

  * Guidance with a particular tool

### 11. End
