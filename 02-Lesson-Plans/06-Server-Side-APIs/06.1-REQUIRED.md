# Module 06 Virtual Class: Server-Side APIs

## Overview

In today's virtual class, students will practice using `fetch()` and displaying the responses to the browser.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Use `fetch()` to make requests to APIs

* Parse JSON responses from `fetch()` requests

## Instructor Notes

* Use the introduction to gauge student comprehension of the material. A Fist to Five activity is scripted below, but feel free to make an assessment using other means, such as a poll.

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate questions students may have.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* When reviewing activities, ask for volunteers to share their solutions and/or ask students to walk through the solution line-by-line.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* If you are comfortable doing so, share your struggles and/or personal experiences learning and working with the concepts covered in this lesson.

* `Fetch` is a fairly simple topic, but this is new to students so be prepared for questions on syntax or basic errors.

* Explain to students that `fetch()` is a an api that allows you to pass additional headers, request parameters, and even a body to the server. However, in these exercises, we will be using the `fetch()` api to make simple GET requests to a server.

* In Lesson 1 of the async material, students are introduced to `fetch()`, public APIs, and how to display the response.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Invite students to post questions in the Zoom chat so TAs and/or the instructor can address them at the end of class.

* Open the [Slide Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hrJFo5_NZzWlcXWgJyMUymoJWt2dDW1uxKy_FLhfeQE/edit?usp=sharing) and walk through the following slides on foundation setting:

    **Big Picture**: This is an opportunity to zoom out and look at the big picture of where students are in the course. Take a moment to discuss a few real-world examples of why this week's topics are valuable.

    **Boot Camp Pointers**: Review some logistics that will help students stay on track. This is an opportunity to speak to what students might need at this particular point in the course.

    **This Week**: Review the key skills students will be learning this week.

    **This Week's Assignment**: Give a quick summary of this week's Challenge assignment and describe how the skills they learn throughout the week will be applied to it.

    **Career Connection**: Reinforce that students will use the skills they learn this week throughout their careers. It's important for them to know the "why" and "how" behind the "what." Give examples of how these skills are used on the job. If you feel comfortable, share examples of how you have used them in your professional career.

  * Students are now intensely focused on understanding JavaScript, Web APIs, third-party APIs, and server-side APIs. It's a lot for them absorb. With this might come forgetting how important it is to keep on top of Career Services content&mdash;after all, the goal is a new career, right?

  * Remind students to complete the employer-ready and employer-competitive tasks assigned to them in the weekly Career Connection:

  * Build a small application: With your new skills, you may be tempted to incorporate external data in your existing portfolio, like displaying today's weather. Why not take things a step further? Try building a small application that's enticing to prospective employers. For example, you could build a dynamic weather app that uses the browser API to get the user's location, then makes a request to an external API to display the weather. Be sure to push the final page to GitHub, get a live site going, and write a fully formed README file.

  * Add AJAX as a skill on your resume: The Technical Skills section of your resume should now proudly display AJAX next to JavaScript. This is a big deal because companies make server calls to APIs all the time!

  * Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è Why should we bother adding skills like AJAX to our resume?

    * üôã When you apply to jobs at larger companies, they'll often run your resume through something called an Applicant Tracking System (ATS), which matches keywords with job descriptions and automatically filters out candidates.

    * ‚òùÔ∏è Exactly! And can anybody think of another place where we should really think about the keywords and skills we might add?

    * üôã LinkedIn! LinkedIn is a great place for recruiters and HR managers to find potential employees‚Äîthese searches usually start by dropping keywords into the search function. Therefore, it's important to have a clean headline and skills section that details all the skills and interests you have.
  
    **How to Succeed This Week**: Remind students that they might experience moments of frustration as they learn complex concepts and tools, and that these times are actually proven opportunities to deepen knowledge. Consider sharing something about your personal learning journey. This helps students recognize that everyone starts somewhere and that they are not alone.

    **Today's Objectives**: Outline the concepts that will be covered in today's lesson. Remind students that they can find the relevant activity files in the "Getting Ready for Class" page in their course content.

### 2. Instructor Do: Student Check-In (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How are you feeling about your progress so far?

  * üôã We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back at what we accomplished and acknowledge that it is a lot! It‚Äôs also okay to feel overwhelmed&mdash;as long as you don‚Äôt give up.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with this topic?

  * üôã Let's do Fist to Five together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 3. Instructor Demo: Create Fetch (5 min)

* Open `01-Create_Fetch/Solved/index.html` in your browser, open the console, and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë After you click the "Fetch Your User Repos" button, a fetch request is sent to GitHub's API to retrieve a user's repositories.

  * üîë The response from the API is then used to populate the unordered list of repositories on the page.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What do we need to pass through fetch() to get an API to send back data?

  * üôã We need a proper endpoint which can be found using the GitHub API documentation.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How is a request like this useful?

  * üôã GitHub makes a lot of their API endpoints available for use in other applications.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Create Fetch (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-Create-Fetch/README.md`, which is also shown here:

  ```md
  # üèóÔ∏è Implement a fetch() Request to Display User Repositories

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a user, I want to see a list of my GitHub repositories.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when I click the "Fetch Your User Repos" button, and a list of my GitHub repositories displays on the page.

  ## Assets

  The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

  ![The web page shows a user's GitHub repositories when the button is selected.](./Images/01-solution-screenshot.png)

  ---

  ## üí° Hints

  * How can we use the [GitHub API documentation on repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#list-repositories-for-a-user) to support this implementation?

  * Where in the URL string is the repository endpoint added?

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * In `fetch()` requests we use the URL. What is the difference between a URL and URI?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 5. Instructor Review: Create Fetch (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel creating a Fetch request? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Root endpoint + path  = endpoint

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `/users/octocat/repos`

* Open `02-Create-Fetch/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We create a function called `getApi`, as follows:

    ```js
    function getApi() {
    ```

  * üîë We save the full endpoint we would like to make a request to in a variable called `requestUrl`, replacing `octocat` with the username we want to search, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    var requestUrl = 'https://api.github.com/users/octocat/repos';
    ```

  * We then pass the `requestUrl` variable as an argument to the `fetch()` method, like in the following code:

    ```js
    fetch(requestUrl)
    ```

  * We convert the response into JSON. Lastly, we `return` the JSON-formatted response, as follows:

    ```js
    .then(function (response) {
      return response.json();
    })
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How do we build the `requestURL`?

  * üôã We attach the desired endpoint to the root endpoint. We can also attach additional parameters to the URL, like in the following example:

    ```md
    https://api.github.com/users/octocat/repos?page=2
    ```

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, refer to the [GitHub API documentation on repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos), and check out the MDN Documentation on [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Parsing JSON (5 min)

* Open `02-Parse-JSON/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë When the page loads, we see a GIF.

  * üîë Every time we refresh the page, a random GIF now loads!

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Where have we used this before?

  * üôã In Lesson 1, students used `fetch` to send a request to the GitHub API and get a user's repos.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  * üôã We will need to use `fetch` and display responses from APIs on our pages.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?

  * üôã After receiving responses from our API, all we need to do is use some JavaScript to display these responses to the page.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Parsing JSON (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Response/README.md`, which is also shown here:

    ```md
    # Display Response

    In this activity, you will take the response from the fetch request and display the GIF in the browser.

    ## Instructions

    * Open the [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) file and examine the ID's and class names of the HTML elements. This will be important for DOM manipulation later.

    * Open the [script.js](Unsolved/assets/js/script.js) file and follow the directions in the comments to display the GIF on the page.

    * Use DOM manipulation to create HTML elements and append them to the page. 

    ## Hint(s)

    * You can refer to the [DOM Docs on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents)
    ```

### 8. Instructor Review: Parsing JSON (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points (:key:) below to review the following key points (‚úîÔ∏è):

  * ‚úîÔ∏è DOM Manipulation to display response

* Open `02-Response/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We write a fetch request to Giphy, using the `random` endpoint so we only receive one response. We could use other endpoints, but then we would need to loop through the response.

    ```js
    fetch('https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/random?api_key=HvaacROi9w5oQCDYHSIk42eiDSIXH3FN')
    ```

  * We `.then()` convert the response to JSON with `.json()`.

    ```js
    .then(function(response) {
        return response.json();
    });
    ```

  * üîë We will then do some DOM manipulation to display the response. We will first grab the ID via `document.querySelector`.

    ```js
    var responseContainerEl = document.querySelector("#response-container")
    ```

  * Next, we create an `<img>` element, and then set its `src` attribute to be equal to `response.data.image_url` from our API response.

    ```js
    var gifImg = document.createElement("img");
    gifImg.setAttribute("src", response.data.image_url)
    ```

  * Finally we will take the `responseContainerEl` and append the `gifImg` we created to it.

    ```js
    responseContainerEl.appendChild(gifImg)
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How do API calls and DOM manipulation come together to help us?

  * üôã We are now able to take responses from our API calls and display those results to the browser however we like.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understanding this?

  * üôã We can refer to Lesson 1, read the [DOM Docs on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

  * üôã We covered `fetch` and how we can display responses from our fetches to the browser!

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

  * üôã All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's unnecessary to know any one thing completely to be successful.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material as possible?

  * üôã It's important both to be fully prepared to start the Challenge assignment, and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

  * üôã In Lesson 1, a `fetch` request is made to the GitHub API. Students can refer back to this lesson if they want to recap that material.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Use student answers to transition to Office Hours.

### 10. Challenge Review (30 min)

* Take this time to help get students unblocked on the current Challenge that they are working through.

* Expect that students may ask for the following:

  * Further review on a particular subject

  * Debugging assistance

  * Help with computer issues

  * Guidance with a particular tool
