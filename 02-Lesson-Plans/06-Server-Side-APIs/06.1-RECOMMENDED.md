# Module 06 Virtual Class (Recommended): Server-Side APIs

## Overview 

In today's recommended virtual class, students will practice using `fetch()` and displaying the responses to the browser, as well as solve a new algorithm in CodeSignal. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Solve the CodeSignal algorithm `arrayMedian`

* Use `fetch()` to make requests to APIs

* Use vanilla JavaScript to display responses to the browser

## Instructor Notes

* Use the introduction to gauge student comprehension of the material. A Fist-to-Five activity is scripted below, but feel free to make an assessment using other means, such as a poll.

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try and anticipate questions students may have.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* When reviewing activities, ask for volunteers to share their solutions and/or ask students to walk through the solution line-by-line.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, share your struggle and/or personal experiences learning and working with the concepts covered in this lesson.

* `Fetch` is a fairly simple topic, but being this is new to students be prepared for questions on syntax or basic errors.

* In lesson 1 of the async material, students are introduced to `fetch()`, public APIs, and how to display the response.

## Class Instruction 

### 1. Introduction  (5 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Direct students to post individual questions in the Zoom chat to be addressed by TAs and/or at the end of class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

    * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our skills, and starting to take our skills and make some requests to outside APIs! It is important to remember how much you have already covered, its a lot! Its okay to feel overwhelmed, but always remind yourself of how much you have already learned!

    * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic? 

    * 🙋 Let's do "Fist to Five" together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 2. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* [Click here for CodeSignal challenge](https://app.codesignal.com/public-test/KXE5b7L3CPKSdYkzh/35X8aLqz9hNStg) 

* Students are head down focusing on understanding JavaScript, Web APIs and now 3rd-party APIs too. It's a lot. With this, comes forgetting how important it is to keep on top of Career Services content — after all, the goal is a new career, right?

* Remind students to complete the employer ready and employer competitive tasks assigned to them in the weekly Career Connection:

  * Build a Small Application: 
  
    _With your new skills, you may be tempted to incorporate external data in your existing portfolio, like displaying today's weather. But why not take things a step further? Try building a small application that's enticing to prospective employers. For example, you could build a dynamic weather app that uses the browser API to get the user's location, then makes a request to an external API to display the weather. Be sure to push the final page to GitHub, get a live site going, and write a fully formed README file._

  * Add AJAX as a Skill on Your Resume:
  
    _The Technical Skills section of your resume should now proudly display AJAX next to JavaScript. This is a big deal because companies make server calls to APIs all the time!_

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Did anyone attempt the Code Signal algorithm?

  * 🙋 It is encouraged to take advantage of the CodeSignal practice because it reflects real-world online interviewing.

* Open your IDE and review the solution to the Code Signal algorithm:

  * The algorithm is called `arrayMedian`. We are given an array of numbers, `sequence`, for which we need to find the median.

  * Remind students that the median is the number which lies at the midpoint of the array if there is an odd amount of numbers, when they are ordered from smallest to largest. When there is an even amount of numbers, we take the midpoint of the two middle numbers.

  * For `sequence = [-1, 3, -2, 2]`, the output should be `arrayMedian(sequence) = 0.5`

  * For `sequence = [1, 3, 2]`, the output should be `arrayMedian(sequence) = 2`

  * The instructions provide the following details regarding input and output:

    ```md
    [execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)

    [input] array.integer sequence

    An unsorted array of integers.

    Guaranteed constraints:
    2 ≤ sequence.length ≤ 105,
    -106 ≤ sequence[i] ≤ 106.

    [output] float

    The median of sequence.
    ```

  * We are also provided the following starter code:

    ```js
    function arrayMedian(sequence) {

    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝) and call on students for answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What is the first step to solve this problem?

  * 🙋In order to find the median, we first need to sort the array from smallest to largest.

    ```js
    sequence.sort( function(a,b) {return a - b;} );
    ```

  * ☝️ Once we've done this, how do we find the middle of the array?

  * 🙋 Divide the length of the sequence by 2. This gives us an index number on the array which is the middle. We need to round down for the half way point. I.e. If the array length is `7`, and we divide by 2, we get 3.5. Using `Math.floor()` gives us `3` as the index of the half way point. 

    ```js
    var middle = Math.floor(sequence.length / 2);
    ```

  * ☝️ Awesome! Now how do we check if middle point is one number or two numbers?

  * 🙋 Use the modulus operator `%` to establish if there are any remainders.

    ```js
    if(sequence.length % 2)
            return sequence[middle];
        else
            return (sequence[middle - 1] + sequence[middle]) / 2;
    ```

* Full solution:

```js
function arrayMedian(sequence) {

    sequence.sort( function(a,b) {return a - b;} );

    var middle = Math.floor(sequence.length / 2);

    if(sequence.length % 2)
        return sequence[middle];
    else
        return (sequence[middle - 1] + sequence[middle]) / 2;
}
```

* Answer any questions students have before moving to the next activity.

### 3. Instructor Demo: Console Fetch (5 min) 

* Open `01-Fetch/Solved/assets/js/index.html` in your browser, open the console, and demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 This application makes a `fetch` request to the Giphy API.

    * 🔑 The response from the API is logged in the console.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 In the async material, we made a request to the GitHub API using `fetch` and `curl` in Lesson 1.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We will need to make `fetch` requests to complete the challenge.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We would simply use standard `fetch` syntax to make a request to the API, and console log our response to start.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Console Fetch (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-Fetch/README.md`.

```md
# Console Fetch

In this activity, you will create a fetch request and log the response in the console.

## Instructions

* Open the [script.js](Unsolved/assets/js/script.js) file and create a fetch request to the Giphy API.

    * Use this URL and API key: `https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/trending?api_key=HvaacROi9w5oQCDYHSIk42eiDSIXH3FN`

* Then log the response in the console.

## Hint(s)

* You can refer to the [MDN Docs on Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).
```

### 5. Instructor Review: Console Fetch (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ `fetch('url')`

    * ✔️ `.then()`

* Open `01-Fetch/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 We write a request using the `fetch(url)` syntax. When making a request to Giphy we need to be sure to put our API key at the end.

    ```js
    fetch('https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/trending?api_key=HvaacROi9w5oQCDYHSIk42eiDSIXH3FN')
    ```

    * 🔑 We `.then()` take our response and convert it to `json()`.

    ```js
    .then(function(response) {
        return response.json();
    })
    ```

    * 🔑 Finally we chain another `.then()` function and `console.log` our response.

    ```js
    .then(function(data) {
        console.log(data);
    });
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What does `fetch` allow us to do?

    * 🙋 `fetch` allows us to make API requests via JS.

    * ☝️ Why do we need an API key?

    * 🙋 Most APIs require an API key, and that's a key that will get passed to their API to authorize access. This helps APIs limit requests.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't totally understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 1, read the [MDN Documentation on Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Display Response (5 min) 

* Open `02-Response/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 When the page loads, we see a GIF.

    * 🔑 Every time we refresh the page, a random GIF now loads!

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 In Lesson 1, students used `fetch` to send a request to the GitHub API and get a user's repos. 

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We will need to use `fetch` and display responses from APIs on our pages.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 After receiving responses from our API, all we need to do is use some JavaScript to display these responses to the page.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Display Response (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Response/README.md`.

    ```md
    # Display Response

    In this activity, you will take the response from the fetch request and display the GIF in the browser.

    ## Instructions

    * Open the [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) file and examine the ID's and class names of the HTML elements. This will be important for DOM manipulation later.

    * Open the [script.js](Unsolved/assets/js/script.js) file and follow the directions in the comments to display the GIF on the page.

    * Use DOM manipulation to create HTML elements and append them to the page. 

    ## Hint(s)

    * You can refer to the [DOM Docs on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents)
    ```

### 8. Instructor Review: Display Response (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ DOM Manipulation to display response

* Open `02-Response/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * We write a fetch request to Giphy, using the `random` endpoint so we only receive one response. We could use other endpoints, but then we would need to loop through the response.

    ```js
    fetch('https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/random?api_key=HvaacROi9w5oQCDYHSIk42eiDSIXH3FN')
    ```

    * We `.then()` convert the response to JSON with `.json()`.

    ```js
    .then(function(response) {
        return response.json();
    });
    ```

    * 🔑 We will then do some DOM manipulation to display the response. We will first grab the ID via `document.querySelector`.

    ```js
    var responseContainerEl = document.querySelector("#response-container")
    ```

    * Next, we create an `<img>` element, and then set its `src` attribute to be equal to `response.data.image_url` from our API response. 

    ```js
    var gifImg = document.createElement("img");
    gifImg.setAttribute("src", response.data.image_url)
    ```

    * Finally we will take the `responseContainerEl` and append the `gifImg` we created to it.

    ```js
    responseContainerEl.appendChild(gifImg)
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How do API calls and DOM manipulation come together to help us?

    * 🙋 We are now able to take responses from our API calls and display those results to the browser however we like.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understanding this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 1, read the [DOM Docs on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 09. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

    * 🙋 We covered `fetch` and how we can display responses from our fetches to the browser!

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's unnecessary to know anything completely to be successful. 

    * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material as possible?

    * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

    * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

    * 🙋 In Lesson 1 a `fetch` request is made to the GitHub API. Students can refer back to this lesson if they would like to recap that material.

    * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Use student answers to transition to office hours.

### 10. Office Hours (30 min)

* Announce Office Hours and invite students to stay on the Zoom and start the challenge while they have live support from instructional staff.
