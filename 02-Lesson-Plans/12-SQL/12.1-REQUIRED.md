# Module 12 Virtual Class: SQL

## Overview 

In today's virtual class, students will learn about MySQL schemas, creating databases and tables, and populating tables with data.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Understand the purpose of a schema

* Create a database and tables

* Populate a table with data

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* Students should have installed MySQL on their machines along with SQLite by now. Direct them to the `Up and Running` on Canvas for directions on how to install it if they haven't done so.

* After starting up the MySQL server, make sure the students can initialize the MySQL command line prompt: `mysql -u root -p`. They will need their MySQL password.

  * Some MacOS users may find that this doesn't work and get the error message, "command not found". Students may need to add the following into their `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc` file:
 
    `export PATH="${PATH}:/usr/local/mysql/bin/"`

  * For Windows users, they can refer to [this documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-windows-excerpt/5.7/en/mysql-installation-windows-path.html) if they also get the error.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms and check if the students have installed MySQL correctly and are able to do the activities without technical difficulties. 

* Students will be more familiar with SQLite syntax than MySQL. Even though they are very similar, there are a few differences, like `AUTO_INCREMENT`, `CREATE DATABASE`, the `PRIMARY KEY` designation, and [MySQL client commands](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql-commands.html). 

* In the async material, students create a schema and seed the table from the command line in Lesson 1.

## Class Instructions 

### 1. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Invite students to post questions in the Zoom chat so TAs and/or the instructor can address them at the end of class.

* Open the lesson's [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16JRBi30jrnrmm5S828oammi5IapfzVsAjSCsHsi06As/edit?usp=sharing) and walk through the following slides on foundation setting: 

   **Big Picture**: This is an opportunity to look at the big picture of where students are in the course. Take a moment to discuss a few real-world examples of why this week's topics are valuable.

   **Boot Camp Pointers**: Review some logistics that will help students stay on track. This is an opportunity to speak to what students might need at this particular point in the course. 

   **This Week**: Review the key skills students will be learning this week. 

   **This Week's Assignment**: Give a quick summary of this week's Challenge assignment and describe how the skills they learn throughout the week will be applied to it.

   **Career Connection**: Reinforce that students will use the skills they learn this week throughout their careers. It's important for them to know the "why" and "how" behind the "what." Give examples of how these skills are used on the job. If you feel comfortable, share examples of how you have used them in your professional career.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ 

    * 🙋 
  
   **How to Succeed This Week**: Remind students that they might experience moments of frustration as they learn complex concepts and tools, and that these times are actually proven opportunities to deepen knowledge. Consider sharing something about your personal learning journey. This helps students recognize that everyone starts somewhere and that they are not alone.

   **Today's Objectives:** Outline the concepts that will be covered in today's lesson. Remind students that they can find the relevant activity files in the "Getting Ready for Class" page in their course content.

### 2. Instructor Do: Student Check-In (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

  * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back at what we accomplished and acknowledge that it is a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic?

  * 🙋 Let's do Fist to Five together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 3. Instructor Demo: SQL Schema (5 min) 

* Navigate to `01-SQL-Schema/Solved/` in the command line and initialize the MySQL command line by typing `mysql -u root -p` and your MySQL password. Be sure your MySQL Server is running! Demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 After we initialize the MySQL command line, `mysql>`, we can execute the `schema.sql` file by typing: `source schema.sql`

    * 🔑 We can verify that the database and tables were created with the command `show databases;` and `show tables;` 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 This is similar to how we loaded the `schema.sql` file and verified the schema from the SQLite command line in Lesson 1. 

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We would need to create a connection between the database server and the database for our challenge. 

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 First we need to create the `schema.sql` file with the SQL script to create the database and table.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 4. Student Do: SQL Schema (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-SQL-Schema/README.md`.

```md
# SQL Schema

In this activity, you will create a MySQL database and tables.

## Instructions

* In the [Unsolved](Unsolved/) folder, create a `schema.sql` file for a database named `books_db`

  * Add these commands to the top of the file to create a database:

  DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS books_db;
  CREATE DATABASE books_db;
  USE books_db;

  * Create two tables, one for `books` and one for `authors`. 

    * In the `books` table, add columns for the following:

      * `id`

      * `authorId` 

      * `title`

      * `PRIMARY KEY`

    * In the `authors` table, add columns for the following: 

      * `id`

      * `firstName`

      * `lastName`

      * `PRIMARY KEY`

* To initiate the MySQL command line, type: `mysql -u root -p` in your command line and then your MySQL password. Be sure your MySQL Server is running!

* To execute the `schema.sql` file, type into the MySQL command line: `source schema.sql`

* To check if everything was done correctly, type `show databases;` and `show tables;` in the MySQL command line. Don't forget the semicolon!

* To exit the MySQL command line, type `quit;` or `exit;`

## Hint(s)

* You may need to consult the MySQL documentation on [creating a table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/creating-tables.html) 
```

### 5. Instructor Review: SQL Schema (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ `CREATE DATABASE`

    * ✔️ `books` and `authors` tables

    * ✔️ `source schema.sql`

* Open `01-SQL-Schema/Solved/schema.sql` in your IDE and explain the following:

    * 🔑 We create the database with the command `CREATE DATABASE`, along with `DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS` and `USE`:
  
    ```sql
    DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS books_db;
    CREATE DATABASE books_db;
    USE books_db;
    ```

    * 🔑 We create the `books` table with the `CREATE TABLE books` command. Notice we must specify whether the columns will hold `INTEGER` or `VARCHAR` values:
  
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE books(
      id INTEGER(11) AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL,
      authorId INTEGER(11),
      title VARCHAR(100),
      PRIMARY KEY (id)
    );
    ```
    * 🔑 We create the `authors` table with the `CREATE TABLE authors` command:
  
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE authors(
      id INTEGER(11) AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL,
      firstName VARCHAR(100),
      lastName VARCHAR(100),
      PRIMARY KEY (id)
    );
    ```

    * 🔑 To initiate the MySQL command line, type: `mysql -u root -p` in your command line and then your MySQL password. We create the `books_db` database by executing `source schema.sql`

    ```bash
    source schema.sql
    ```

    * In order to check if everything was done correctly, we can type `show databases;` and `show tables;` in the MySQL command line.

    * To exit the MySQL command line, type `quit;` or `exit;`

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Why do we drop the `books_db` if it exists?

    * 🙋 We would want to reset data and schema to the original data set, just in case. Eliminates surprises.

    * ☝️ Why do we need a schema?

    * 🙋 It creates the table's structure. It is necessary for SQL queries, which rely on the structure.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understanding this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 1, read the [MySQL documentation on schemas](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/getting-information.html), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 6. Instructor Demo: SQL Seeds (5 min) 

* Navigate to `02-SQL-Seeds/Solved/` in the command line and initialize the MySQL command line. Demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 After we initialize the MySQL command line, we set up the database by typing: `source schema.sql`

    * 🔑 Then we can seed the database by typing: `source seeds.sql`

    * 🔑 We can verify that the `authors` table was populated with data by querying the database: `SELECT * FROM authors;` 
  
* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used the same command in Lesson 1 to query the `candidates` table.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 Executing SQL commands give us a way to test prepared statements in an application.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We need to create the SQL commands in the `seeds.sql` file

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 7. Student Do: SQL Seeds (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-SQL-Seeds/README.md`.

```md
# SQL Seeds 

In this activity, you will populate the `books_db` database with data.

## Instructions

* In the [Unsolved](Unsolved/) folder, create a `seeds.sql` file.

  * Insert the following names, in this order, into their corresponding columns in `authors`:

    1. Jane Austen
    
    2. Mark Twain
    
    3. Lewis Carroll
    
    4. Andre Asselin

  * Insert the following titles and `authorId` into their corresponding columns in `books`:

    * 'Pride and Prejudice', 1

    * 'Emma', 1

    * 'The Adventures of Tom Sawyer', 2

    * 'Adventures of Huckleberry Finn', 2

    * 'Alice''s Adventures in Wonderland', 3

    * 'Dracula', null 

* To initiate the MySQL command line, type: `mysql -u root -p` in your command line and then your MySQL password. Be sure your MySQL Server is running!

* To set up the database, type into the MySQL command line: `source schema.sql`

* To seed the database, type into the MySQL command line: `source seeds.sql`

* To check if everything was done correctly, type into the MySQL command line: `SELECT * FROM authors;` or `SELECT * FROM books;`

* To exit the MySQL command line, type `quit;` or `exit;`

## Hint(s)

* You may need to consult the MySQL documentation on [loading data into a table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/loading-tables.html).
```

### 8. Instructor Review: SQL Seeds (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ `INSERT INTO`

    * ✔️ `VALUES`

* Open `02-SQL-Seeds/Solved/seeds.sql` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 We use the `INSERT INTO` statement to add new records one at a time. We specify what table we are inserting into and which columns. In our case, we want to insert into the `authors` table in the `firstName` and then the `lastName` columns.

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO authors (firstName, lastName)
    ```

    * 🔑 Then we use `VALUES` to specify the values being inserted into the columns:

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO authors (firstName, lastName) VALUES ('Jane', 'Austen');
    INSERT INTO authors (firstName, lastName) VALUES ('Mark', 'Twain');
    INSERT INTO authors (firstName, lastName) VALUES ('Lewis', 'Carroll');
    INSERT INTO authors (firstName, lastName) VALUES ('Andre', 'Asselin');
    ```

    * We repeat for `books`:

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO books (title, authorId) VALUES ('Pride and Prejudice', 1);
    INSERT INTO books (title, authorId) VALUES ('Emma', 1);
    INSERT INTO books (title, authorId) VALUES ('The Adventures of Tom Sawyer', 2);
    INSERT INTO books (title, authorId) VALUES ('Adventures of Huckleberry Finn', 2);
    INSERT INTO books (title, authorId) VALUES ('Alice''s Adventures in Wonderland', 3);
    INSERT INTO books (title, authorId) VALUES ('Dracula', null);
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What are the benefits of seeding a table?

    * 🙋 Seeding a table allows the developer to query the database.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understanding this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 1, read the the MySQL documentation on [loading data into a table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/loading-tables.html), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

    * 🙋 We learned how to create a database and tables in MySQL, which is the database engine we will use for future modules. We also learned how to seed data into the databases.

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful. 

    * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

    * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer. 

    * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

    * 🙋 Lesson 1 covered SQL queries and executing SQL files to modify databases.

    * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Use student answers to transition to office hours.

### 10. Office Hours (30 min)

* Announce office hours and invite students to stay on the Zoom and start the challenge while they have live support from instructional staff.
