# Module 12 Instructor Overview: SQL

## Overview

In this week's virtual classes, you'll teach students MySQL schemas, creating databases and tables, and populating tables with data. You will also review `JOIN` statements, the `mysql2` npm package, and `?` prepared statements.

## Virtual Classes

[Recommended Class](./12.1-RECOMMENDED.md)

[Required Class](./12.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* In this module, students will be using SQLite for the project in the async lessons, however we will use MySQL in these virtual classes. Make sure the students install both SQLite and MySQL for this module. Detailed instructions are provided in the `Up and Running` for this module. 

* Be sure to [install MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) before this week's classes and run the server to be able to initialize the MySQL command line prompt.

## Heads Up

* Next week you will introduce ORMs, more specifically Sequelize. BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO GO TOO IN DEPTH. There are a ton of components that make Sequelize work, but much of it is boilerplate that doesn't need much explanation. 

* THIS IS TOUGH STUFF! Tell your class to not feel discouraged if there are concepts that they can't nail down completely. Tell them to try their best, but to speak with you or a TA if they're unsure of anything.
