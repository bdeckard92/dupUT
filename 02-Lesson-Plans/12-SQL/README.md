# Module 12 Instructor Overview: SQL

## Overview

In this module, students will learn to use MySQL, the most popular SQL database. Students will also learn to store and retrieve data using databases and expand their knowledge of how to build a full-stack application with persistent storage.

In this week's virtual classes, you will cover MySQL schemas, creating databases and tables, and populating tables with data. You will also review `JOIN` statements, the `mysql2` npm package, and prepared statements.

The following table maps the key topics covered in the virtual lessons to where they are taught in the asynchronous content:

| Day | Topic               | Location         |
| --- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| 1   | Schemas             | 12.1, 12.3       |
| 1   | Seeds               | 12.1, 12.3, 12.4 |
| 1   | Git Guide           | N/A              |
| 2   | Constraints         | 12.1 - 12.3      |
| 2   | Joins               | 12.3             |
| 2   | Prepared Statements | 12.4             |

## Overview of Asynchronous Material

This week in the asynchronous content, students are introduced to SQL. These skills are important for the following reasons:

* Data is the foundation of all modern applications. Knowing how to use relational databases is one of the most sought-after skills by employers.

* SQL is one of the cornerstone technologies used in all of web development.

* SQL is still used by some of the biggest tech companies in the world, like Uber, Netflix, Airbnb, and many more.

* SQL enables students to join similar sets of data in a meaningful way.

* SQL makes students employer-ready by opening them up to more than just front-end positions.

* SQL allows students to more easily trace the connection between the front end and the back end.

Throughout the async module this week, students will use SQL to do the following:

* Configure a Node.js application to connect to a SQL instance.

* Create and drop databases and tables.

* Explain and execute CRUD methods.

* Create schema and seed files for development and production.

* Write join statements to establish relations between data in one or more tables, using primary and foreign keys.

* Explain the use and importance of prepared statements.

**Reminder**: If students need help with an async activity, encourage them to attend Office Hours. If they need more help, remind them that they can use Learning Assistants via the AskBCS bot.

The following table contains a description of each lesson's portion of the module project and the corresponding key points that are taught:


| Lesson | Description                   | Key Points                                                                                       |
| ------ | ----------------------------- | --- |
| 1      | Introduce SQL.           | Creating databases, creating and populating tables, creating schemas                             |
| 2      | Create the candidate routes.       | Using `mysql2` to connect MySQL to a Node.js server, executing queries, testing routes with Insomnia    |
| 3      | Join with the parties table.       | Updating schemas, adding new fields, combining data from two tables, introducing constraints |
| 4      | Create the voter table and routes. | Modularizing routes, adding timestamps to new data, sorting data                                 |
| 5      | Populate and tally votes.      | Using SQL commands to count values, implementing constraints to avoid duplicate or `null` values |

## Virtual Classes

Here are the lesson plans for this week's virtual classes:

* [Virtual Class 12.1](./12.1-REQUIRED.md)

* [Virtual Class 12.2](./12.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to install the MySQL Server on your computer before this week's classes, and be able to initialize MySQL Shell. For installation instructions, refer to the [MySQL installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mysql/mysql-installation-guide).

* Make sure that students can initialize the MySQL Shell using the command `mysql -u root -p`. They will need their MySQL password. Students should also be encouraged to use a MySQL password that is not used for any other personal accounts.

  * If Mac users get a `command not found` error, set up a `.zshrc` file in your home directory and add the `mysql` command to it. To do this, navigate to the home directory and type the following command in the command line: `echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc`. Mac users who install using Homebrew should not face this issue. Refer to [MySQL Installation Guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mysql/mysql-installation-guide) for installation instructions.

  * If Windows users get a `command not found` error, refer them to the [MySQL documentation on customizing the PATH](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-windows-excerpt/5.7/en/mysql-installation-windows-path.html).

* Be sure to review the activities before class. Try to anticipate any questions that students might have.

* For the activities that use an Express.js server, you will be required to pass your username and SQL password as a parameter of `createConnection()`. Make sure to change the provided user -- if you are not using the default `root` -- and add your personal SQL password before running each demo or activity. The changes will need to be made in the `server.js` file.

* **Important**: You will be demonstrating with a file that contains your database credentials. Be sure that your MySQL password is not used for any other personal accounts, because it will be visible during the demonstrations.

* Remind students to complete the Midpoint Survey coming up. Clarify that this survey is NOT about the current module but is about the entire course until this point! Itâ€™s important that they're aware of this in advance and that they take their time to complete the survey. This will ultimately help us understand how we can improve the program, curriculum, instruction, and support.

### Common Pain Points

According to our class data, students might experience some of the following pain points throughout the week:

| Pain Point                       | Recommendation                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------- | --- |
| How MySQL deals with constraints | Refer students to the [MySQL documentation on how MySQL deals with constraints](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/constraints.html).                     |
| Inability to access MySQL shell  | Refer students to the [MySQL documentation on resetting permissions](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/resetting-permissions.html). |

## Career Connection

The first virtual class of the week contains a Career Connection section, which links the current module's coursework with career services and students' future careers. During this section, it can be helpful to share examples of how you've used these skills and tools in your professional life.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Coach and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for career services workshops.](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp).

If you'd like more information about career services, visit the [career services resources page](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp).

## Module Challenge

For the [Module 12 Challenge](../../01-Class-Content/12-SQL/02-Challenge/README.md), students will build a command-line application to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. Doing so will allow students to demonstrate their knowledge of not only MySQL and relational databases but also Node.js and JavaScript.

Students must know how to implement the following skills in order to succeed in this week's Challenge:

* Configuring a Node.js application to connect to a MySQL database

* Creating and dropping databases and tables

* Working with persistent data using **CRUD (create, read, update, delete)** methods

* Creating schema and seed files for the development of an application

* Writing join statements to establish relations between data in three separate tables using primary and foreign keys

## Heads-Up

Next week you'll introduce ORMs, specifically Sequelize. It is crucial to NOT go too in depth on this; although many components make Sequelize work, much of it is boilerplate that doesn't need detailed explanation.

This is tough stuff! Tell students not to feel discouraged if they struggle to fully comprehend some concepts. Encourage them to try their best but to speak with you or a TA if they're unsure of anything.
