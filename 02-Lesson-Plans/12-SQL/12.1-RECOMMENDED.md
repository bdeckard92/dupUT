# Module 12 Virtual Class (Recommended): SQL

## Overview 

In today's recommended virtual class, we will review schemas, creating databases and tables, and populating tables with data, as well as solve a new algorithm in CodeSignal. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Solve the CodeSignal algorithm `camelCaseSeparation`

* Create a database and tables

* Populate a table with data

* Understand the purpose of a schema


## Instructor Notes

* Students will be more familiar with SQLite syntax vs MySQL. Even though they are very similar, there are a few differences, like `AUTO_INCREMENT`, `CREATE DATABASE`, the `PRIMARY KEY` designation, and [MySQL client commands](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql-commands.html). 

* [How to initiate the MySQL command line.](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql.html)  `mysql -u root -p`

* Students have not seen this command in this module, might be best to give this snippet to them to place at top the `schema.sql` file.

```sql
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS books_db;
CREATE DATABASE books_db;
USE books_db;
```

* [Install MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) ahead of time and run the community server to initialize the mysql command line prompt. This is to run the `schema.sql` and `seeds.sql` from the MySQL command prompt. 

* MySQL CLI $PATH must sometimes be manually entered depending on OS.

  * [macOS](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/176786/how-to-add-mysql-to-path-variable-to-resolve-mysql-command-not-found). 

  * [Windows](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-windows-excerpt/5.7/en/mysql-installation-windows-path.html)

* In the async material, students create a schema and seed the table from the command line using files in Lesson 1.

## Class Instructions 

### 1. Introduction (5 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Direct students to post individual questions in the Zoom chat to be addressed by TAs and/or at the end of class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

    * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back and see what we accomplished, and acknowledge that it's a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic? 

    * 🙋 Let's do "fist to five" together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).


### 2. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* [Click here for CodeSignal challenge](https://app.codesignal.com/public-test/Az2qBBpbLLktvi6MR/6KJ2ebjXrCiSPo) 

* Students are likely to feel overwhelmed with the introduction of yet another coding language this week — SQL. 

* Remind students to complete the employer ready and employer competitive tasks assigned to them in the weekly Career Connection. 

  * This week, they explored different flavors of SQL — MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MariaDB — and their prevalence in their local area by searching on Indeed.com.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What were some of the in-demand varieties of SQL you found?

  * 🙋 Answer will vary, but will include MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MariaDB.

  * ☝️ How similar are the SQL varieties?

  * 🙋Very similar! If you know one, it is easy to move to another. So this skill is highly marketable.

  * ☝️ Did anyone attempt the Code Signal algorithm?

* Use student answers to transition to the next activity.

* Open your IDE and review the solution to the Code Signal algorithm:

  * The algorithm is called `camelCaseSeparation`. We are given an array of words, `words`, and a variable name, `variableName`. The algorithm should check `variableName` against `words`, and verify whether it is a correct camelCase variable name.

  * For example, if `words = ["is", "valid", "right"]` and `variableName = "isValid"`, the output should be `camelCaseSeparation(words, variableName) = true` as `variableName` consists of words "is" and "valid", and both of them are in `words`.
  
  * For example, if `words = ["is", "valid", "right"]` and `variableName = "isValId"`, the output should be `camelCaseSeparation(words, variableName) = false` as `variableName` is separated to words "is", "val", "id", and not all words are in `words`.

  * The instructions provide the following details regarding input and output:

  ```md
  [execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)

  [input] array.string words

  An array of words consisting of lowercase English letters.

  Guaranteed constraints:
  1 ≤ words.length ≤ 103.
  ```

  * We are also provided the following starter code:

  ```js
  function camelCaseSeparation(words, variableName) {
  
  }
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What is the first step to solve this problem?

  * 🙋 We should add on a capital letter to the end of the word to indicate a stopping place, and create a holder variable for the current word we're looking at when iterating.

  ```js
    variableName += 'A';
    let currentWord = '';
  ```

  * ☝️ Once we have these in place, how can we check whether the variable name is valid?

  * 🙋 We would use a `for` loop, iterate through the variable name, and check whether it is a capital letter. If it is, we would check whether that word exists in the array. If it doesn't exist, return `false`. If it does exist, add it to our `currentWord` placeholder.

  ```js
  for (let i = 0; i < variableName.length; i++) {
    if ('A' <= variableName[i] && variableName[i] <= 'Z') {
      currentWord = currentWord.toLowerCase();
      if (currentWord.length > 0 && !words.includes(currentWord)){
        return false;
      }
      currentWord = '';
    }

    currentWord += variableName[i];
  }
  ```

  * ☝️ Perfect! And at the end, you'll just need to add return `true` if we never returned `false` on any of our iterations.

  ```js
  return true;
  ```

* Answer any questions students have before moving to the next activity.

### 3. Instructor Demo: SQL Schema (5 min) 

* Run [01-Stu_Schema/Solved/schema.sql](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/fullstack-online/blob/FSFO-742-12-required-lp/01-Class-Content/12-SQL/01-Activities/01-Stu_Schema/Solved/schema.sql) in the MySQL command line and demonstrate the following: 

    * 🔑 When we initialize the MySQL command line, `mysql>`, we can execute the `schema.sql` file. `mysql> source schema.sql`  (MySQL community server must be running)

    * 🔑 When can verify the table and database were made with the command `SHOW TABLES;`, `SHOW DATABASES;`.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 Similar to how we loaded the `schema.sql` file from the command line in Lesson 1. Also how we verified the schema from the command line.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 Yes, we must first create a connection between the database server and the database. 

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 First create the `schema.sql` file with the SQL script to create the database and table.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 4. Student Do: SQL Schema (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-Stu_Routes/README.md`.

```md
    
  * Create a `schema.sql` file for a database, `books_db`

    DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS books_db;
    CREATE DATABASE books_db;
    USE books_db;
    ```

    * 🔑 We create the `books` table with the `CREATE TABLE books` command:
  
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE books(
      id INTEGER(11) AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL,
      authorId INTEGER(11),
      title VARCHAR(100),
      PRIMARY KEY (id)
    );
    ```
    * 🔑 We create the `authors` table with the `CREATE TABLE authors` command:
  
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE authors(
      id INTEGER(11) AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL,
      firstName VARCHAR(100),
      lastName VARCHAR(100),
