# Module 12 Virtual Class: SQL

## Overview 

In today's virtual class, students will review constraints, `JOIN` statements, and `?` prepared statements.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Specify the relationship between tables using primary and foreign keys.

* Write a SQL query that joins two tables together.

* Implement `?` prepared statements in conjunction with `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.

## Instructor Notes 

* At the beginning of class, tell students that they will be prompted to complete a Midpoint Survey about their boot camp experience thus far. It’s important that they are aware of this in advance and that they take their time to complete the survey, to help us understand how we can improve the program, curriculum, instruction, and support!

* Be sure to prepare and review the activities before class. Try to anticipate any questions that students might have.

* Students should have installed MySQL on their machines by now. If not, direct them to the "Up and Running" content in the async material for instructions.

* After starting the MySQL server, make sure that students can initialize the MySQL command-line prompt, using the command `mysql -u root -p`. They will need their MySQL password.

  * If Mac users get a `command not found` error, set up a `.zshrc` file in your home directory and add the `mysql` command to it. To do this, navigate to the home directory and type the following command in the command line: echo `export PATH="/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc`. Mac users who install using Homebrew should not face this issue. Refer to [MySQL Installation Guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mysql/mysql-installation-guide) for installation instructions.

  * If Windows users get the `command not found` error, refer them to the [MySQL documentation on customizing the PATH](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-windows-excerpt/5.7/en/mysql-installation-windows-path.html).

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms and check whether students have installed MySQL correctly and can do the activities without technical difficulties. 

* When they create API routes for their candidate data in Lesson 2 of the async material, students are introduced to the `mysql2` npm package and prepared statements. In Lesson 3, they learn about `JOIN` statements to merge candidate data with party data.

## Office Hours

Encourage students to work on the remaining module algorithms during office hours. Review the algorithm solutions 5&ndash;10 minutes before class begins or during Office Hours after class.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Remind students to complete the Midpoint Survey to help us understand how we can improve the program, curriculum, instruction, and support. Clarify that this survey is NOT about the current module but is about the entire course up until this point!

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What did you learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

    * 🙋 We learned what foreign keys are, how to use `JOIN` statements, and how to connect to a SQL database from Node.js. We are moving fast compared to traditional learners. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ Did anyone have an "Aha!" or "Eureka!" moment this week? When was it and why did things suddenly click for you? 

    * 🙋 Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we're thinking about it.

    * ☝️ Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

    * 🙋 It's easy to get stuck when you're learning web development. It's important to learn how to get unstuck because it happens to the pros too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the tool's official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups are great because explaining your problems to someone else often reveals the solution. 

### 2. Review Current Challenge (5 min)

* Navigate to `02-Challenge/Main/` from the command line and run `node index.js` to demonstrate the following: 

    * When we select "View All Employees," the contents of the `employees` table are combined with data from other tables.

    * When we select "Add Employee," we can input different data points to insert a new record in the table.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What recently acquired skills will help us build this challenge?

    * 🙋 SQL statements like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, and `JOIN` and SQL-related npm packages.

    * ☝️ How are these skills relevant to a career in web development?

    * 🙋 The majority of business apps will need a database!

    * ☝️ How will this challenge improve your portfolio?

    * 🙋 Knowing how to create a database-driven app will enable you to build bigger, more impressive portfolio pieces.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 3. Instructor Demo: SQL Constraints (5 min) 

* Navigate to `03-SQL-Constraints/Solved/` in the command line and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We execute the `schema.sql` file by using the `SOURCE` command and typing `SOURCE db/schema.sql;`.

  * 🔑 To see the types of data in the `books` table and the constraints, we use the `DESCRIBE` command and type `DESCRIBE books;`.

  * 🔑 We use constraints to define rules for the table's columns. 

  * 🔑 We add a `NOT NULL` constraint to require each row of the table to have a value for a column. In the `books` table, both the `id` and `book_name` must have a value because the `NOT NULL` constraint is applied. 
  
  * 🔑 The `id` column is also set to `AUTO INCREMENT`, which will generate a unique, sequential value every time a new row is added to the table. 

  * 🔑 We use the `Primary Key` constraint, described by `PRI` in the `key` column, to specify which column will be used to uniquely identify each row.

  * 🔑 We use the `Foreign Key` constraint, described by `MUL` in the `key` column, to identify a column from a table that we will use to link two tables together. 

  * 🔑 A foreign key always references the primary key of another table.    

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used this to define the relationship between the `candidates` and `parties` tables in Lesson 3.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We will need to define relationships between the tables so that we can use the `JOIN` clause to combine employee data with other tables.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We use the primary key to specify the column that will uniquely identify the table. We use the foreign key to define the column that will link two tables.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: SQL Constraints  (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `03-SQL-Constraints/README.md`.

  ```md
  # 🏗️ Use Primary Key and Foreign Key to Define Relationship Between Tables

  Implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to link two tables using primary and foreign keys.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when the `id` columns of both tables are defined as the primary key and auto-increment.

  * It's done when the foreign key in the `books` table refers to the `prices` table's primary key.

  ---

  ## 💡 Hints

  What is the difference between the primary and foreign key constraints?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What are the advantages of using multiple related tables to store the data? 

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```
  
### 5. Instructor Review: SQL Constraints  (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ `PRIMARY KEY`

  * ✔️ `FOREIGN KEY`

  * ✔️ `REFERENCES`

* Open `03-SQL-Constraints/Solved/db/schema.sql` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 We use the `PRIMARY KEY` constraint to set up the unique identifier for the table&mdash;often the `id` column of the table. The column that is designated as the `PRIMARY KEY` must have unique data for each row. 
 
  * We use `AUTO-INCREMENT` to generate a new and unique id for each row automatically: 

    ```sql
    id INTEGER NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    ```
  
  * 🔑 In the `books` table, we want the `price` column to link to the `prices` table. We use the `FOREIGN KEY` constraint to set the `price` column to link to another table: 

    ```sql
     FOREIGN KEY (price)
    ```

  * 🔑 We use the `REFERENCE` clause to define the table and `PRIMARY KEY` that we want the book's `price` table to link to, thus defining the relationship between tables. We always link a `FOREIGN KEY` to a `PRIMARY KEY` in another table: 
  
    ```sql
    REFERENCES prices(id)
    ```

  * We use the `ON DELETE` clause to specify what happens when data is deleted from the table that we are referencing: 

    ```sql
    ON DELETE SET NULL
    ``` 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What's the purpose of a `PRIMARY KEY` constraint?

  * 🙋 The `PRIMARY KEY` constraint provides a unique identifer for each row of data in a table.

  * ☝️ What is the purpose of a `FOREIGN KEY` constraint?

  * 🙋 A `FOREIGN KEY` constraint links two or more tables. 

  * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [MySQL documentation on foreign key constraints](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/constraint-foreign-key.html) and the [MySQL documentation on primary keys](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/partitioning-limitations-partitioning-keys-unique-keys.html), and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: SQL JOIN (5 min) 

* Navigate to `04-SQL-Join/Solved/` in the command line and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We initialize the MySQL Shell by typing `mysql -u root -p` and the MySQL password. Make sure that your MySQL Server is running!

  * 🔑 We set up the database by typing `source db/schema.sql` in the MySQL Shell.

  * 🔑 We seed the database by typing `source db/seeds.sql`.

  * 🔑 We join the `prices` and `books` data together by executing a query in `db/query.sql`.

  * 🔑 If the join is successful, the price for each book will appear in the table.     

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used this to join `candidates` with their `party affiliation` in Lesson 3.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We will need to use `JOIN` to combine employee data with other tables, like their departments.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 First we will use primary and foreign keys to set a relationship between the tables. Then we will write a query that uses the `JOIN` clause. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: SQL JOIN  (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-SQL-JOIN/README.md`.

  ```md
  # 📐 Add Comments to Implementation of a MySQL JOIN Clause

  Add comments describing the functionality of the code found in [query.sql](./Unsolved/db/query.sql) and [schema.sql](./Unsolved/db/schema.sql).

  ## 📝 Notes

  Refer to the documentation: 

  [MySQL documentation on JOIN clause](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/join.html)

  ---

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * How do we define a relationship between two tables?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```
  
### 8. Instructor Review: SQL JOIN  (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ `SELECT AS`

  * ✔️ `JOIN` clause

  * ✔️ `ON` clause

* Open `04-SQL-Join/Solved/db/query.sql` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 We select the columns we want to appear in the joined table by using the `SELECT` command. Because we are working with two tables, we use dot notation to enter the name of the table, followed by the name of the column:

    ```sql
    SELECT
    books.book_name
    ```
  
  * 🔑 We use the `AS` clause to rename the columns. This alias will appear as the column name at the top of the table: 

    ```sql
    SELECT
    books.book_name AS book_name, prices.price AS price
    ```
  
  * We use `FROM` to select the `books` table. The `books` table references the `price` table with a foreign key: 

    ```sql
    FROM books
    ```
    
  * 🔑 We then join the price table using the `JOIN` clause:

    ```sql
    JOIN prices 
    ```
    
   * 🔑 We use the `ON` clause to show the relationship between the two tables. In the `schema`, the `books` price column references the `prices` id column:
   
     ```sql
     JOIN prices ON books.price = prices.id;
     ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What's the purpose of a `JOIN` clause?

  * 🙋 To combine data from two different but related tables.

  * ☝️ Why is it important to include an `ON` clause?

  * 🙋 The `ON` clause specifies the relationship between the tables that we want to join. 

  * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [MySQL documentation on the JOIN clause](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/join.html), and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Instructor Demo: Prepared Statements  (5 min) 

* Navigate to `05-SQL-Prepared-Statements/Solved` in your command line and run `npm install` and `node server.js` to demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We can execute a query directly in the Express.js server to delete a single row from the table. 

* Open `05-SQL-Prepared-Statements/Solved/server.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 To delete a single row, we must have the row's unique id. 

  * 🔑 We can hardcode that `id` directly in the query, but to make the query more durable, we can use a prepared statement. 

  * 🔑 The prepared statement uses a `?` as a placeholder for the id's value: 

    ```sql
    DELETE FROM books WHERE id = ?
    ```

  * 🔑 For the `DELETE` to work, we then provide the value we want inserted in place of the `?` as the second argument of the `query()` function. This value is often a variable, such as `deletedRow`:

    ```js
    db.query(`DELETE FROM books WHERE id = ?`, deletedRow, (err, result) => {
      if (err) {
        console.log(err);
      }
      console.log(result);
    });
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used prepared statements in Lesson 2 and in Lesson 4 when we built the CRUD routes. 

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 The employee tracker will require us to use prepared statements to perform CRUD operations. 

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We can use the `query()` function and prepared statements to execute CRUD operations with SQL queries.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 10. Student Do: Prepared Statements  (20 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `05-Prepared-Statements/README.md`.

  ```md
  # 🐛 Query Not Deleting Row from Table

  Resolve the following issue(s):

  * As a developer, I want to be able to delete a specific row from the `books` table. 

  ## Expected Behavior

  When I run `server.js`, the row with the `id` of `2` should be deleted from the table and the updated table displayed in the console.

  ## Actual Behavior

  When I run `server.js`, an `ER_PARSE_ERROR` results and the table is not updated. 

  ## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

  1. In the MySQL Shell, execute the `db/schema.sql` file. 

  2. Next, execute the `db/seeds.sql` file. 

  3. Run `node server.js` to start the Express.js server. The results of the query and the table are shown in the console. 

  ## Assets

  The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

  ![The console displays rows 1 through 7, except for row 2, which has been successfully deleted.](./assets/image_1.png)

  ---

  ## 💡 Hints

  What does the `?` represent in a prepared statement? 

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * How can you set user-defined values using a MySQL statement? 

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 11. Instructor Review: Prepared Statement  (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ `?` prepared statements

* Open `05-Prepared-Statements/Solved/server.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 We use a prepared statement to insert a variable (represented by a `?`) into the query:

    ```sql
    DELETE FROM books WHERE id = ?
    ```

  * 🔑 To execute the `DELETE`, we must supply the prepared statement with a value. We assign the `deletedRow` variable a value of `2`:
  
    ```js
    let deletedRow = 2;
    ```
    
  * 🔑 To execute the query, we add the variable name as the second argument for the query function. This will set the `id = 2` when the query is executed:

    ```js
    db.query(`DELETE FROM books WHERE id = ?`, deletedRow, (err, result) => {
      if (err) {
        console.log(err);
      }
     console.log(result);
    });
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why would we want to use prepared statements?

  * 🙋 We use prepared statements to make queries more durable. Instead of writing multiple queries, we can write a single query with a `?` placeholder and insert different values as needed to execute the query. 

  * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [MySQL documentation on prepared statements](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2#using-prepared-statements), and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 12. Recap & Promote Additional Resources (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What do you think you absolutely need to know to succeed at the challenge?

  * 🙋 We will need to know how to join tables together and how to connect to a MySQL database from Node.js.

  * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

  * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it is not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful. 

  * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material prior to class as possible?

  * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build on in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

* Direct students to the additional resources available to them:

  * Reflection and Retrieval

  * Career Connection

  * Dessert Menu

### 13. Introduce Upcoming Challenge (5 min)

* Navigate to `01-Class-Content/13-ORM/02-Challenge/Main/` from the command line and run `node server.js`.

* Open <http://localhost:3001/api/products> in a browser and demonstrate the following: 

    * You're going to build the API routes for a products database.

    * Products belong to a category and can have many tags each.

    * You'll be using an ORM called Sequelize to help you define your data's relationships and execute complicated queries.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What are we learning?

    * 🙋 We are learning about ORMs (and in particular, Sequelize).

    * ☝️ How does this project build off or extend previously learned material?

    * 🙋 We'll continue using SQL but in a more complicated context.

    * ☝️ How does this project relate to your career goals?

    * 🙋 Professional applications rely on ORMs like Sequelize to make their data easier to define and understand. ORMs also implement many safeguards to help prevent bad or malicious data.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.
