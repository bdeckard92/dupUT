# Module 12 Virtual Class (Required): SQL

## Overview 

In today's required session, students will review `JOIN` statements, the `mysql2` npm package, and `?` prepared statements.


## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Write a SQL query that joins two tables together

* Use the `mysql2` npm package to create a database connection

* Implement prepared statements in conjunction with `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`


## Instructor Notes 

* Students will be more familiar with SQLite syntax vs MySQL. Even though they are 99% the same, there are a few gotchas like `RIGHT JOIN` statements not being supported in SQLite.

* In the async material, students use the `sqlite3` npm package instead of `mysql2`. It is first introduced in Lesson 2 when students create API routes for their candidate data. In Lesson 3, they learn about `JOIN` statements to merge candidate data with party data.


## Office Hours

Encourage students to work on the remaining module algorithms during office hours. Review the algorithm solutions 5–10 minutes before class begins or during office hours after class.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What did you learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

    * 🙋 @TODO We learned { X, Y & Z }. We are moving fast compared to traditional learners. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ Did anyone have an "Aha!" or "Eureka!" moment this week? When was it and why did things suddenly click for you? 

    * 🙋 Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we're thinking about it.

    * ☝️ Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

    * 🙋 It's easy to get stuck when you're learning web development. It's important to learn how to get unstuck because it happens to the pros too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the tool's official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups are great because explaining your problems to someone else often reveals the solution.

    * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material prior to class as possible?

    * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp.

The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.
