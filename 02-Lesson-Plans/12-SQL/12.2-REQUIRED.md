# Module 12 Virtual Class (Required): SQL

## Overview 

In today's required virtual class, students will review `JOIN` statements, the `mysql2` npm package, and `?` prepared statements.


## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Write a SQL query that joins two tables together

* Use the `mysql2` npm package to create a database connection

* Implement prepared statements in conjunction with `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`

## Instructor Notes 

* Students should have installed MySQL on their machines along with SQLite by now. Direct them to the `Up and Running` on Canvas for directions on how to install it if they haven't done so.

* After starting up the MySQL server, make sure the students can initialize the MySQL command line prompt: `mysql -u root -p`. They will need their MySQL password.

  * Some MacOS users may find that this doesn't work and get the error message, "command not found". Students may need to add the following into their `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc` file:
 
    `export PATH="${PATH}:/usr/local/mysql/bin/"`

  * For Windows users, they can refer to [this documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-windows-excerpt/5.7/en/mysql-installation-windows-path.html) if they also get the error.

* Students will be more familiar with SQLite syntax vs MySQL. Even though they are 99% the same, there are a few gotchas like `RIGHT JOIN` statements not being supported in SQLite.

* Create and seed the challenge and activity databases ahead of time so you're able to demo them to the students. You'll also need to add your password to the various `server.js` files, if you have a password on your instance of MySQL.

* In the async material, students use the `sqlite3` npm package instead of `mysql2`. It is first introduced in Lesson 2 when students create API routes for their candidate data. In Lesson 3, they learn about `JOIN` statements to merge candidate data with party data.


## Office Hours

Encourage students to work on the remaining module algorithms during office hours. Review the algorithm solutions 5–10 minutes before class begins or during office hours after class.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What did you learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

    * 🙋 We learned what foreign keys are, how to use `JOIN` statements, and how to connect to a SQL database from Node. We are moving fast compared to traditional learners. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ Did anyone have an "Aha!" or "Eureka!" moment this week? When was it and why did things suddenly click for you? 

    * 🙋 Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we're thinking about it.

    * ☝️ Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

    * 🙋 It's easy to get stuck when you're learning web development. It's important to learn how to get unstuck because it happens to the pros too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the tool's official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups are great because explaining your problems to someone else often reveals the solution. 


### 2. Review Current Challenge (5 min)

* Run [02-Challenge/Master/index.js](../../01-Class-Content/12-SQL/02-Challenge/Master/index.js) from the command line and demonstrate the following: 

    * When we select "View All Employees," we see the contents of the `employees` table combined with data from other tables.

    * When we select "Add Employee," we can input different data points to insert a new record in the table.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What recently acquired skills will help us build this challenge?

    * 🙋 SQL statements like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, and `JOIN` and SQL-related npm packages.

    * ☝️ How are these skills relevant to a career in web development?

    * 🙋 The majority of business apps are going to need a database!

    * ☝️ How will this challenge improve your portfolio?

    * 🙋 A database-driven app will lend to bigger, more impressive portfolio pieces.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 3. Instructor Demo: SQL JOIN (5 min) 

* Navigate to `03-SQL-JOIN/Solved/` in the command line and initialize the MySQL command line by typing `mysql -u root -p` and your MySQL password. Be sure your MySQL Server is running!

    * 🔑 Set up the database by typing `source schema.sql` in the MySQL command line

    * 🔑 Seed the database by typing `source seeds.sql`

    * 🔑 We will join the `books` and `authors` data together by executing `source join.sql`

    * 🔑 Different types of joins allow us to get different combinations of the data.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used this to join candidates with their party affiliation in Lesson 3.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We will need to use `JOIN` to combine employee data with other tables, like their departments.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We will need a foreign key in the `books` table that references an author's ID.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 4. Student Do: SQL JOIN  (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `03-SQL-JOIN/README.md`.

  ```md
  # SQL JOIN

  In this activity, you will join the `books` and `authors` data together using JOIN queries.

  ## Instructions 

  * In the [Unsolved/](Unsolved/) folder, create a `join.sql` file and write JOIN queries for the following: 

    * show ALL books with authors

    * show ALL books, even if we don't know the author

    * show ALL authors, even if we don't know the book

  * To initiate the MySQL command line, type: `mysql -u root -p` in your command line and then your MySQL password.

  * To set up the database, type into the MySQL command line: `source schema.sql`

  * To seed the database, type into the MySQL command line: `source seeds.sql`

  * To check if everything was done correctly, type into the MySQL command line: `source join.sql`

  * To exit the MySQL command line, type `quit;` or `exit;`

  ## Hint(s)

  * Think of when you would use `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN` queries.
  ```

### 5. Instructor Review: SQL JOIN  (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ `JOIN` and `ON` syntax

    * ✔️ `INNER` vs `LEFT` vs `RIGHT`

* Open `03-SQL-JOIN/Solved/join.sql` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 We joined the `books` table with the `authors` table, specifying that the book's foreign key (`authorId`) matches the author's primary key (`id`). This is accomplished by using `INNER JOIN` to only get the books with authors:

      ```sql
      SELECT title, firstName, lastName
      FROM books
      INNER JOIN authors ON books.authorId = authors.id;
      ```

    * 🔑 We performed another join on the same tables but used a `LEFT JOIN` this time to get all of the books (the left table) and only the authors that match. If there is no author, it is shown as `NULL`:

      ```sql
      SELECT title, firstName, lastName
      FROM books
      LEFT JOIN authors ON books.authorId = authors.id;
      ```

    * 🔑 Finally, we performed a `RIGHT JOIN` to get all of the authors (the right table) and only the books that match. If there is no book, it is shown as `NULL`:

      ```sql
      SELECT title, firstName, lastName
      FROM books
      RIGHT JOIN authors ON books.authorId = authors.id;
      ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What's the purpose of a `JOIN` clause?

    * 🙋 To combine data from two different but related tables.

    * ☝️ What's the difference between `INNER`, `LEFT`, and `RIGHT` joins?

    * 🙋 An `INNER JOIN` only returns matching values. `LEFT JOIN` returns everything from the left table and only matches from the right. `RIGHT JOIN` is just the opposite.

    * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 3, read the [MySQL docs on the JOIN clause](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/join.html), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 6. Instructor Demo: Node Read  (5 min) 

* Navigate to `04-Node-Read/Solved` in the command line and initialize the MySQL command line. Set up the database and seed it. Exit the MySQL command line. 

* Be sure to update `server.js` with your MySQL password. Run `npm install` and then `npm start` in the command line to demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 The app uses an npm package, `mysql2`, to connect to a MySQL database.

    * 🔑 The app prints all of the rows of data from the database's `products` table.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used this to build API routes in Lessons 2-5 but using SQLite.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We will need to interact with the `employees` table from Node.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We need to install `mysql2`, connect to the MySQL database, and query the database.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 7. Student Do: Node Read  (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Node-Read/README.md`

```md
# Node Read

In this activity, you will use a npm package to connect to a MySQL database and print all of the rows of the database's table. 

## Instructions 

* Navigate to the [Unsolved/](Unsolved/) folder and set up the database:

  * Initialize the MySQL command line: `mysql -u root -p` and your MySQL password.

  * Run the `schema.sql` and `seeds.sql` files from the MySQL command line to create and populate the `iceCreamDB` database. Exit the MySQL command line when done.

* Open the [Unsolved/server.js](Unsolved/server.js) file and do the following:

  * Update the `user` and `password` with your MySQL username and password.

  * In the `afterConnection` function, write a simple query that will `SELECT` everything from the `products` table and log the results in the console.

## Hint(s)

* You may need to consult the documentation for the [mysql2 package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2).
```

### 8. Instructor Review: Node Read  (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ Install the `mysql2` package

  * ✔️ Connect to a MySQL database

  * ✔️ Execute SQL queries from Node

* Open `04-Note-Read/Solved/server.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 We require the `mysql2` package (NOT the `sqlite3` package).

  * We use the `createConnection()` method to define our MySQL credentials, changing the user/password as needed, and create the connection to the database:

  ```js
  // Create the connection to database
  const connection = mysql.createConnection({
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 3306,
    // Your MySQL username
    user: 'root',
    // Your MySQL password
    password: '',
    database: 'ice_creamDB'
  });
  ```

  * 🔑 Next, we use the `connect()` method to establish the connection between Node and MySQL, calling the next function if there are no errors:

  ```js
  connection.connect(err => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log('connected as id ' + connection.threadId);
    afterConnection();
  });
  ```

  * 🔑 Finally, we use the `query()` method to execute SQL queries, capturing the data in a callback function:

  ```js
  afterConnection = () => {
    connection.query('SELECT * FROM products', (err, res) => {
      if (err) throw err;
      console.log(res);
      connection.end();
    });
  };
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What properties in the `createConnection()` method would most likely need to change from project to project?

    * 🙋 The user, password, and database.

    * ☝️ How is the `res` data structured in the `query()` method's callback function?

    * 🙋 It's an array of objects.

    * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [mysql2 npm docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 9. Instructor Demo: Node CRUD  (5 min) 

* Run [05-Stu_Node-CRUD/Solved/server.js](../../01-Class-Content/12-SQL/01-Activities/05-Stu_Node-CRUD/Solved/server.js) from the command line and demonstrate the following: 

    * 🔑 The app connects to the same `ice_creamDB` database from before.

    * 🔑 The app performs an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `SELECT` in sequential order.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used this to build API routes in Lessons 2-5.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 The Employee Tracker performs various CRUD operations.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We can use the `connection.query()` method to execute additional SQL queries.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 10. Student Do: Node CRUD  (20 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in [05-Stu_Node-CRUD/README.md](../../01-Class-Content/12-SQL/01-Activities/05-Stu_Node-CRUD/README.md).

  ```md
  * Write and call functions to CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE data in the `iceCreamDB` database. 

  ## Hint(s)

  * Recall that you can create MySQL queries which include variables using question marks. Proper usage of this will help you quite a bit.
  ```


### 11. Instructor Review: Node CRUD  (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ `?` prepared statements

    * ✔️ Asynchronous callbacks

* Open [05-Stu_Node-CRUD/Solved/server.js](../../01-Class-Content/12-SQL/01-Activities/05-Stu_Node-CRUD/Solved/server.js) in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * We call a `createProduct()` function after the database connection is successful:

      ```js
      connection.connect(function (err) {
        if (err) throw err;
        console.log("connected as id " + connection.threadId + "\n");
        createProduct();
      });
      ```

    * 🔑 In `createProduct()`, we use a `?` placeholder in the query and fill in the data later with a second object argument:

      ```js
      var query = connection.query(
        "INSERT INTO products SET ?", {
          flavor: "Rocky Road",
          price: 3.0,
          quantity: 50
        },
        ...
      );
      ```

    * We save the return value of `connection.query()` to a variable, `sql`, so we can verify what the final query actually looks like:

      ```js
      console.log(query.sql);
      ```

    * 🔑 We call the next `updateProduct()` function from within the callback function to ensure it happens AFTER the insertion is complete:

      ```js
      function (err, res) {
        if (err) throw err;
        console.log(res.affectedRows + " product inserted!\n");
        // Call updateProduct AFTER the INSERT completes
        updateProduct();
      }
      ```

    * 🔑 In `updateProduct()`, we use two `?` placeholders, so the second argument is an array of objects:

      ```js
      var query = connection.query(
        "UPDATE products SET ? WHERE ?",
        [
          {
            quantity: 100
          },
          {
            flavor: "Rocky Road"
          }
        ],
        ...
      );
      ```

    * In the callback function, we call the next function in the process (delete):

      ```js
      function (err, res) {
        if (err) throw err;
        console.log(res.affectedRows + " products updated!\n");
        // Call deleteProduct AFTER the UPDATE completes
        deleteProduct();
      }
      ```

    * In `deleteProduct()`, we use a single `?` placeholder again for the `WHERE` clause and call the last function, `readProducts()`, in the callback:

      ```js
      function deleteProduct() {
        console.log("Deleting all strawberry icecream...\n");
        connection.query(
          "DELETE FROM products WHERE ?", {
            flavor: "strawberry"
          },
          function (err, res) {
            if (err) throw err;
            console.log(res.affectedRows + " products deleted!\n");
            // Call readProducts AFTER the DELETE completes
            readProducts();
          }
        );
      }
      ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Why would we want to use prepared statements?

    * 🙋 The syntax can be easier to read/write; it protects us against SQL injection.

    * ☝️ When using prepared statements, how can you verify the actual SQL query being run?

    * 🙋 Save the return value in a variable and console log `query.sql`.

    * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [mysql2 npm docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 12. Recap & Promote Additional Resources (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What do you think you absolutely need to know to succeed at the challenge?

    * 🙋 We will need to know how to join tables together and how to connect to a MySQL database from Node.

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it is not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful. 

    * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material prior to class as possible?

    * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

* Direct students to the additional resources available to them:

    * Reflection and Retrieval

    * Career Connection

    * Dessert Menu

### 13. Introduce Upcoming Challenge (5 min)

* Navigate to [13-ORM/02-Challenge/Master/](../../01-Class-Content/13-ORM/02-Challenge/Master/) from the command line and run `node server.js`.

* Open <http://localhost:3000/api/products> in a browser and demonstrate the following: 

    * You're going to build the API routes for a products database.

    * Products belong to a category and can have many tags each.

    * You'll be using an ORM called Sequelize to help you define your data's relationships and help you to execute complicated queries.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What are we learning?

    * 🙋 We are learning about ORMs (and in particular, Sequelize).

    * ☝️ How does this project build off or extend previously learned material?

    * 🙋 We'll continue using SQL but in a more complicated context.

    * ☝️ How does this project relate to your career goals?

    * 🙋 Professional applications rely on ORMs, like Sequelize, to make the data easier to define and understand. ORMs also implement many safeguards for us to prevent bad or malicious data.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 14. Office Hours (30 min)

* Announce office hours and encourage students to stay on the Zoom and start the challenge while they have live support from instructional staff.
