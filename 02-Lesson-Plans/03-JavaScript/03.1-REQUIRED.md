# Module 03 Virtual Class: JavaScript

## Overview 

In today's virtual class, students will learn about technical interviews, as well as review conditional statements and iteration.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Explain what technical interviewing is

* Implement some technical interviewing strategies for success

* Implement conditional control flow using `if`, `else` and `elseif` statements

* Implement array iteration using `for` loops

## Instructor Notes

* Today's activities are simple and straightforward. Use any extra time to demonstrate alternative solutions or review other programming concepts. 

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate questions students may have.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* Students will struggle with different aspects of programming. Be sure to reinforce both foundational concepts as well as syntax. 

* The activities in this class will reference the first two lessons of the module, specifically using conditional statements to check the state of the robots' health and iterating through arrays used to face the enemy robots in the `enemyNames` array.

## Class Instructions 

### 1. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Invite students to post questions in the Zoom chat so TAs and/or the instructor can address them at the end of class.

* Open the lesson [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uz-GJ6vwTDSJNxfYw7l9FEAc6ZwTxXD7dcOxQC_sZB4/edit?usp=sharing) and walk through the following slides on foundation setting: 

	**Big Picture**: This is an opportunity to look at the big picture of where students are in the course. Take a moment to discuss a few real-world examples of why this week's topics are valuable.

	**Boot Camp Pointers**: Review some logistics that will help students stay on track. This is an opportunity to speak to what students might need at this particular point in the course. 

	**This Week**: Review the key skills students will be learning this week. 

	**This Week's Assignment**: Give a quick summary of this week's Challenge assignment and describe how the skills they learn throughout the week will be applied to it.

	**Career Connection**: Reinforce that students will use the skills they learn this week throughout their careers. It's important for them to know the "why" and "how" behind the "what." Give examples of how these skills are used on the job. If you feel comfortable, share examples of how you have used them in your professional career. The first few questions are intended to get students talking, so make sure to manage your time effectively. Only plan to spend about 20&ndash;30 seconds on the first few questions so that you have more time to discuss how to prepare for job applications and interviews.

	* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

		* ☝️ What is the first step to getting a job in web development?

		* 🙋 We need to apply!

		* ☝️ What is the interview process for web development? 

		* 🙋 Every interview process is different and largely depends on the company. The interviewing process for web development roles can be much more rigorous than we might be accustomed to. As a general rule, we can expect to go through several rounds, including technical and behavioral interviews.

		* ☝️ The first interview is often an HR or recruiting agency pre-screen call. What's the purpose of this interview?

		* 🙋 The pre-screen is a brief 10&ndash;15 minute phone call to give an overview of the role and ask about your experience and salary expectations.

		* ☝️ If the pre-screen call goes well, the next interview is most likely with the hiring manager. What is the purpose of this interview? 

		* 🙋 The hiring manager is likely to ask questions about your experience with specific technologies that are relevant to the position.

		* ☝️ If the interview with the hiring manager goes well, the next interview is most likely technical. What is a technical interview?

		* 🙋 The technical interview assesses your technical profiency. It might be an in-person whiteboarding session or it might happen via an online assessment platform, such as HackerRank.

		* ☝️ If the technical interview goes well, the next interview is likely behavioral. What is the purpose of the behavioral interview? 

		* 🙋 The behavioral interview gauges your cultural and personality fit with the team.

		* ☝️ If the behavioral interview goes well, what is the likely next step?

		* 🙋 The next step is likely an offer detailing the compensation package, including salary, benefits, and bonus.    

   **How to Succeed This Week**: Remind students that they might experience moments of frustration as they learn complex concepts and tools, and that these times are actually proven opportunities to deepen knowledge. Consider sharing something about your personal learning journey. This helps students recognize that everyone starts somewhere and that they are not alone.

   **Today's Objectives**: Outline the concepts that will be covered in today's lesson. Remind students that they can find the relevant activity files in the "Getting Ready for Class" page in their course content. 

### 2. Instructor Do: Student Check-In (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

  * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back at what we accomplished and acknowledge that it is a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic?

  * 🙋 Let's do Fist to Five together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 3. Instructor Demo: Conditional Statements (5 min) 

* Open `01-Conditional-Statements/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

	* 🔑 When we open our application in the browser, we are asked to confirm whether or not we eat meat.

	* 🔑 If we click `OK`, we receive an alert about a cheese burger. 
	
	* 🔑 If we click `Cancel`, we receive an alert about a veggie burger.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

	* ☝️ Where have we used this before?

	* 🙋 We used conditional statements in Lesson 1 to check on the state of the robot's health. 

	* ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

	* 🙋 We will need to get user input and use it with conditional statements. 

	* ☝️ How would we build this?

	* 🙋 We would first scaffold a boilerplate HTML file, then add a `<script>` tag containing JavaScript. Next we would assign the value of a `confirm()` to a variable and use a conditional statement to check whether or not the value is true or false. Finally, we would alert the user their burger of choice.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Conditional Statements (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-Conditional-Statements/README.md`, which are also shown here:.

     ```md
     # Conditional Statements

     In this activity, you will use conditional statements to determine which alert will pop up on the screen.

     ## Instructions

     * Open `index.html` in your IDE and create a website from scratch that asks users if they eat meat.

       * If they respond with "OK", alert the following to the page: "Here’s a cheese burger!"

       * If they respond with "Cancel", alert the following to the page: "Here’s a veggie burger!"
     ```

### 5. Instructor Review: Conditional Statements (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points (:key:) below to review the following key points (✔️):

	* ✔️ The `<script>` tag

	* ✔️ Variable declaration and value assignment

	* ✔️ `if` and `else`

* Open `01-Conditional-Statements/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

	* 🔑 To add JavaScript to our application, we need to use the `<script>` tag:

	     ```html
	     <script type="text/javascript">
	     ```

	* 🔑 Within our `<script>` tag, we declare a variable, `isMeatEater`, and assign it the value of the user input from `confirm()`:

	     ```js
	    var isMeatEater = confirm('Do you eat meat?');
	     ```

	* 🔑 We then evaluate whether or not the user eats meat. If the user clicked `OK`, the value stored in `isMeatEater` will be `true`. Otherwise, if `Cancel` was clicked, the value will be `false`. 

	     ```js
	    if (isMeatEater) {
	    	alert("Here's a steak");
	    }
	    else {
	    	alert("Here's an Impossible burger!");
	    }
	    </script>
	     ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

	* ☝️ Why do we only need to pass `isMeatEater` to our conditional statement? 

	* 🙋 A conditional statement evaluates whether or not a condition is true or false. We don't need to use an operator to evaluate `isMeatEater` because it contains a Boolean value. 

	* ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

	* 🙋 We can refer to the lessons, read the [MDN Web Docs on if...else statements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else), and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Iteration Arrays (5 min) 

* Open `02-Iteration-Arrays/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

	* 🔑 If we check the browser console, we see it logs the names of four zoo animals: Zebra, Rhino, Giraffe, and Owl.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

	* ☝️ Where have we used this before?

	* 🙋 We used a `for` loop to iterate through an array in Lesson 2 to find new enemy robots to fight once we have defeated one.

	* ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

	* 🙋 We will need to write `for` loops and select items from arrays.

	* ☝️ How would we build this?

	* 🙋 We would refactor the four `console.log` statements into a `for` loop.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Iteration Arrays (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Iteration-Arrays/README.md`, which are also shown here:

     ```md
     # Array Iteration

     In this activity, you will use a `for` loop to iterate over an array of zoo animals and log them into the console.

     ## Instructions

     * Open `index.html` in your IDE and refactor the code to use a `for` loop to log the name of each animal in the `zooAnimals` array, rather than logging each item individually.

     ## Bonus

     What is DRY in terms of software development?
     ```

### 8. Instructor Review: Iteration Arrays (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points (:key:) below to review the following key points (✔️):

	* ✔️ Iteration using a `for` loop

	* ✔️ Accessing array items by index

* Open `02-Iteration-Arrays/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

	* 🔑 To refactor our code, we implement a `for` loop and set the length of the iteration to the length of our array:

	     ```js
	     for (var i = 0; i < zooAnimals.length; i++) {
	     ```

	* 🔑 To log each animal name, we use the value stored in `i` in each iteration:

	     ```js
	     console.log(zooAnimals[i]);
	     ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

	* ☝️ What if we wanted to increment by 2?

	* 🙋 We could increment using the assignment operator and specifying the value by which we want to increment. For example, `i+=2`. 

	* ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

	* 🙋 We can refer to the lessons, read the [MDN Web Docs on loops and iteration](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration), and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

	* ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

	* 🙋 We reviewed conditional statements and iteration over arrays using `for` loops.

	* ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

	* 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful. 

	* ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

	* 🙋 It's important for two reasons: to be fully prepared to start the Challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer. 

	* ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

	* 🙋 Lesson 2 has examples of conditional statements and `for` loops to iterate through arrays.

	* ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

    * 🙋 Use student answers to transition to Office Hours.

### 10. Challenge Review (30 min)

* Take this time to help get students unblocked on the current Challenge that they are working through.

* Expect that students may ask for the following:

  * Further review on a particular subject

  * Debugging assistance

  * Help with computer issues

  * Guidance with a particular tool
