# 03.1 Virtual Class: JavaScript

## Overview

In today's virtual class, students will learn about technical interviews, and review conditional statements and iteration.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Explain what a technical interview is.

* Implement technical interviewing strategies for success.

* Implement conditional control flow using `if`, `else`, and `elseif` statements.

* Implement array iteration using `for` loops.

## Instructor Notes

* Today's activities are simple and straightforward. Use any extra time to demonstrate alternative solutions or review other programming concepts.

* Take a few minutes before class to review the activities of the day and anticipate questions that a student new to JavaScript might ask.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly, ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity, and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Students will struggle with different aspects of programming. Be sure to reinforce both foundational concepts as well as syntax.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Invite students to post questions in the Zoom chat so TAs and/or the instructor can address them at the end of class.

* Open the lesson [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uz-GJ6vwTDSJNxfYw7l9FEAc6ZwTxXD7dcOxQC_sZB4/edit?usp=sharing) and walk through the following slides on foundation setting:

	**Big Picture**: This is an opportunity to look at the big picture of where students are in the course. Take a moment to discuss a few real-world examples of why this week's topics are valuable.

	**Boot Camp Pointers**: Review some logistics that will help students stay on track. This is an opportunity to speak to what students might need at this particular point in the course.

	**This Week**: Review the key skills students will be learning this week.

	**This Week's Assignment**: Give a quick summary of this week's Challenge assignment and describe how the skills they learn throughout the week will be applied to it.

	**Career Connection**: Reinforce that students will use the skills they learn this week throughout their careers. It's important for them to know the "why" and "how" behind the "what." Give examples of how these skills are used on the job. If you feel comfortable, share examples of how you have used them in your professional career. The first few questions are intended to get students talking, so make sure to manage your time effectively. Only plan to spend about 20-30 seconds on the first few questions so that you have more time to discuss how to prepare for job applications and interviews.

	* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

		* ☝️ What is the first step to getting a job in web development?

		* 🙋 We need to apply!

		* ☝️ What is the interview process for web development?

		* 🙋 Every interview process is different and largely depends on the company. The interviewing process for web development roles can be much more rigorous than we might be accustomed to. As a general rule, we can expect to go through several rounds, including technical and behavioral interviews.

		* ☝️ The first interview is often an HR or recruiting agency pre-screen call. What's the purpose of this interview?

		* 🙋 The pre-screen is a brief 10&ndash;15 minute phone call to give an overview of the role and ask about your experience and salary expectations.

		* ☝️ If the pre-screen call goes well, the next interview is most likely with the hiring manager. What is the purpose of this interview?

		* 🙋 The hiring manager is likely to ask questions about your experience with specific technologies that are relevant to the position.

		* ☝️ If the interview with the hiring manager goes well, the next interview is most likely technical. What is a technical interview?

		* 🙋 The technical interview assesses your technical proficiency. It might be an in-person whiteboarding session or it might happen via an online assessment platform, such as HackerRank.

		* ☝️ If the technical interview goes well, the next interview is likely behavioral. What is the purpose of the behavioral interview?

		* 🙋 The behavioral interview gauges your cultural and personality fit with the team.

		* ☝️ If the behavioral interview goes well, what is the likely next step?

		* 🙋 The next step is likely an offer detailing the compensation package, including salary, benefits, and bonus.

    **How to Succeed This Week**: Remind students that they might experience moments of frustration as they learn complex concepts and tools, and that these times are actually proven opportunities to deepen knowledge. Consider sharing something about your personal learning journey. This helps students recognize that everyone starts somewhere and that they are not alone.

    **Today's Agenda**: Outline the concepts that will be covered in today's lesson. Remind students that they can find the relevant activity files in the "Getting Ready for Class" page in their course content.

### 2. Instructor Do: Student Check-In (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

  * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back at what we've accomplished and acknowledge that it is a lot. It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed -- as long as we don’t give up!

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic?

  * 🙋 Let's do Fist to Five together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 3. Instructor Demo: Conditional Statements (5 min)

* Open `01-Conditional-Statements/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

	* 🔑 When we open `index.html` in the browser and navigate to the console, we see a message indicating that both expressions are false.

* Open `01-Conditional-Statements/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

	* 🔑 We declare a value for `x` and two expressions that evaluate the `x` variable.

      ```js
      var x = 50;
      var expression1 = (x < 25);
      var expression2 = (x > 50);
      ```

  * 🔑 We can then test the expressions using if-else statements. When the `x` value is 50, both statements are false; therefore, the message that indicates that both expressions are false is logged to the console.

      ```js
      if(expression1 && expression2) {
        console.log("True ✅ True ✅");
      } else if (expression1) {
        console.log("True ✅ False ❌");
      } else if (expression2) {
        console.log("False ❌ True ✅");
      } else {
        console.log("False ❌ False ❌");
      }
      ```

	* 🔑 When we change the value of `x`, we can log a different message depending on whether both expressions are true, one expression is true, or both are false.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

	* ☝️ Where have we used this before?

	* 🙋 We used conditional statements in Lesson 1 to check the state of the robot's health.

	* ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

	* 🙋 We will need to get user input and use it with conditional statements.

	* ☝️ How would we build this?

	* 🙋 We would first scaffold a boilerplate HTML file, then add a `<script>` tag to contain our JavaScript. Next, we would assign the value of `x` to a variable and use a conditional statement to check whether the expressions are true or false. Different messages are logged to the console depending on whether both expressions are true, one expression is true, or both expressions are false.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Conditional Statements (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-Conditional-Statements/README.md`, which are also shown here:.

  ```md
  # 🏗️ Create an Algorithm Using Conditional Statements

	Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

	* As a developer, I want to write an algorithm that takes in two expressions and evaluates whether both expressions evaluate to `true`, only one expression evaluates to `true`, or both expressions evaluate to `false`.

	## Acceptance Criteria

	* It is done when the message "True ✅ True ✅" is logged when both `expression1` and `expression2` are true.

	* It is done when the message "True ✅ False ❌" is logged when `expression1` is true.

	* It is done when the message "False ❌ True ✅" is logged when `expression2` is true.

	* It is done when the message "False ❌ False ❌" is logged when both `expression1` and `expression2` are false.

	## 💡 Hints

	Before you start writing your algorithm, do you have a plan documented in plain language that describes how you will use JavaScript to get it done?

	## 🏆 Bonus

	If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

	* What is a switch case?

	Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 5. Instructor Review: Conditional Statements (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `if` statement

  * ✔️ `else if` statement

  * ✔️ `else` statement

* Open `01-Conditional-Statements/Solved/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We can evaluate whether both expressions are `true` by using the logical `&&` operator.

    ```js
    expression1 && expression2
    ```

  * 🔑 To create the conditional statement, we start with `if` and place `expression1 && expression2` in parentheses `()`. The action we want to be performed if the condition evaluates to `true` is written inside curly brackets `{}`. In this case, we want to log `True ✅ True ✅` to the console.

    ```js
    if(expression1 && expression2) {
    console.log("True ✅ True ✅");
    ```

  * 🔑 If `expression1 && expression2` evaluates to `true`, then `True ✅ True ✅` is logged and no other conditions are evaluated. If not, then the second condition is tested.

  * 🔑 The second condition tests whether `expression1` is true. So we place `expression1` in the parentheses.

    ```js
    } else if (expression1) {
    ```

  * If `expression1` evaluates to `true`, then `True ✅ False ❌` is logged and no other conditions are evaluated. If `expression1` does not evaluate to `true`, the next condition is tested.

    ```js
    } else if (expression1) {
      console.log("True ✅ False ❌");
    ```

  * The process repeats again for the remaining `else if` condition. If `expression2` evaluates to `true`, then `False ❌ True ✅` is logged.

    ```js
    } else if (expression2) {
      console.log("False ❌ True ✅");
    ```

  * 🔑 At this point, all the conditions have been tested. If none of the conditions evaluate to `true` after all have been tested, then the action following `else` will execute. In this case, `False ❌ False ❌` will log to the console.

    ```js
    } else {
      console.log("False ❌ False ❌");
    ```

  * 🔑 The action performed depends on the values inputted for the variables `x`, `expression1`, and `expression2`. Because `x` has a value of `50`, both `expression1` and`expression2` currently evaluate to `false`. So because none of the conditions are `true`, the expected action is that `False ❌ False ❌` is logged.

    ```js
    var x = 50;
    var expression1 = (x < 25);
    var expression2 = (x > 50);
    ```

* Open `01-Conditional-Statements/Solved/index.html` in your browser and navigate to the console to explain the following:

  * Because both `expression1` and `expression2` evaluate to `false`, `False ❌ False ❌` logs to the console. However, if the inputs change, the action performed might change.

* Encourage students to experiment with changing the values of `x`, `expression1`, and `expression2` on their own to learn more about how changing the input will change the action performed.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

	* ☝️ How do you think conditional statements might allow decision-making in code?

  * 🙋 Conditional statements allow you to carry out different actions based on conditions. The action is performed only if the condition evaluates to `true`.

	* ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

	* 🙋 We can refer to the lessons, read the [MDN Web Docs on if...else statements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else), and attend Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Iteration (5 min)

* Open `02-Iteration/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

	* 🔑 If we check the browser console, we see that it logs the name of each student as well as a welcome message.

* Open `02-Iteration/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 The name of the students are stored in an array.

      ```js
      var students = ["Sarah", "Orlando", "Heather", "Ismael", "Hung"];
      ```

	* 🔑 We can then loop through the array to log a welcome message for each student.

      ```js
      for(var i=0; i < students.length; i++) {
        console.log("Great to see you, " + students[i] + "!");
      }
      ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

	* ☝️ Where have we used this before?

	* 🙋 We used a `for` loop to iterate through an array in Lesson 2.

	* ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

	* 🙋 We will need to write `for` loops and select items from arrays.

	* ☝️ How would we build this?

	* 🙋 We create an array and then write a `for` loop to iterate through each item in the array to log the messages to the console.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Iteration (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Iteration/README.md`, which are also shown here:

  ```md
  # 🏗️ Iterate Over an Array to Log Messages to Console

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a member of the class, I want to store a list of my classmates and use that list to create a greeting for each student on the list.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It is done when the names of five classmates are stored in a single variable named `students`.

  * It is done when the total number of elements in the `students` array is logged to the console.

  * It is done when, using a `for` loop, the greeting "Great to see you, CLASSMATE_NAME!" logs to the console for each classmate's name in the `students` array.

  ## 💡 Hints

  How can you access each element using the element's index and the array name?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What is a `while` loop?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 8. Instructor Review: Iteration (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `for` statement

  * ✔️ Array iteration

* Open `02-Iteration/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We start by creating a `students` array that holds five names.

    ```js
    var students = ["Sarah", "Orlando", "Heather", "Ismael", "Hung"];
    ```

  * We then use the `length` property to find the total number of elements in the `students` array. This `length` property will be useful when we set the condition for the loop.

    ```js
    students.length
    ```

  * 🔑 We write the `for` loop. We set the counter to `0` and dictate that the loop will run until the counter equals the length of the array.

    ```js
    for(var i=0; i < students.length; i++)
    ```

  * We set the counter `i` to `0`.

    ```js
    var i = 0;
    ```

  * 🔑 We set the conditions under which the loop will run. Because we want to loop over the entire array, we set the condition such that the loop will stop when the counter equals the length of the array.

    ```js
    i < students.length;
    ```

  * Finally, after the block of code is executed, we increment the counter by `1`.

    ```js
    i++
    ```

  * 🔑 Finally, we console log each statement in the array using bracket notation.

    ```js
    console.log("Great to see you, " + students[i]);
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How is iterating over an array useful?

  * 🙋 By iterating over an array, you can perform an action on each element of the array quickly and with just a few lines of code.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to the lessons, read the [MDN Web Docs on loops and iteration](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration), and attend Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Everyone Do: Git (30 min)

* Open the [Atlassian guide to using branches](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches) in your browser and explain the following:

  * When we work on new features or bug fixes, or when we work in a collaborative environment, it is not a good idea to work directly in the `main` branch.

  * Using Git, we can create a copy of the `main` branch and then work in a different branch. Doing so enables us to work in isolation, without messing up the codebase.

  * In this activity, we'll explore the `git branch`, `git checkout`, and `git merge` commands and how we can use them to work in different branches and merge branches locally.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `Git-Guide/README.md`.

* While everyone is working on the activity, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

* Open your command line and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We can create a new branch to work in, as shown in the following code, but it doesn't immediately take us to that new branch:

    ```bash
    git branch <name-of-branch>
    ```

  * 🔑 If we want to move into that branch to work, we use the `checkout` command, as follows:

    ```bash
    git checkout <name-of-branch>
    ```

  * 🔑 Alternatively, we can create a branch and `checkout` into it simultaneously, as follows:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b <name-of-branch>
    ```

  * 🔑 When we finish making changes in the branch, we commit the work to it and `checkout` back to the branch we want this new code to be merged to, then we merge it with the following command:

    ```bash
    git add -A
    git commit -m 'commit message'

    git checkout main
    git merge <name-of-branch>
    ```

  * When we're done, we can keep the feature branch or delete it, as follows:

    ```bash
    git branch -d <name-of-branch>
    ```

* Answer any questions before proceeding.

### 10. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

	* ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

	* 🙋 We reviewed conditional statements and iterating over arrays using `for` loops.

	* ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

	* 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful.

	* ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

	* 🙋 It's important for two reasons: to be fully prepared to start the Challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

	* ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

	* 🙋 Lesson 2 has examples of conditional statements and `for` loops to iterate through arrays.

	* ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Answer any questions before ending the class.
