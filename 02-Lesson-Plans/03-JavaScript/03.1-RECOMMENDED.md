## Class Instructions 

### 1. Introduction (5 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Direct students to post individual questions in the Zoom chat to be addressed by TAs and/or at the end of class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

    * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back and see what we accomplished, and acknowledge that it's a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic? 

    * 🙋 Let's do "fist to five" together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).


### 2. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

@TODO CHECK WITH THE LCA, LCE & CS POC


### 3. Instructor Demo: Conditional Statements (5 min) 

* Open `01-Conditional-Statements/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 When we open our application in the browser, we are asked to confirm whether or not we eat meat.

    * 🔑 If we click `OK`, we receive an alert about a cheese burger. If we click `Cancel`, we receive an alert about an Impossible burger.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 @TODO We used this to accomplish { X, Y, Z }, in { CORRESPONDING ASYNCHRONOUS LESSON PLAN }.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We will need to get user input and use it with conditional statements. 

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We would first scaffold a boilerplate HTML file, then add a `<script>` tag containing JavaScript. Next we would assign the value of a `confirm()` to a variable and use a conditional statement to check whether or not the value is true or false. Lastly, we alert the user their burger of choice.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 4. Student Do: Conditional Statements (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-Conditional-Statements/Solved/index.html`.

```md
    # Conditional Statements

    ## Instructions

    * Create a site (from scratch) that asks users if they eat steak.

    * If they respond with "yes", alert the following to the page: "Here’s a cheese burger!"

    * If they respond with "no", alert the following to the page: "Here’s an Impossible burger!"
```


### 5. Instructor Review: Conditional Statements (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ The `<script>` tag

    * ✔️ Variable declaration and value assignment

    * ✔️ `if` and `else`

* Open `01-Conditional-Statements/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 To add JavaScript to our application, we need to use the `<script>` tag.

    ```html
    <script type="text/javascript">
    ```

    * 🔑 Within our `<script>` tag, we declare a variable, `isMeatEater`, and assign it the value of the user input from `confirm()`. 

    ```js
      var isMeatEater = confirm('Do you eat meat?');
    ```

    * 🔑 We then evaluate whether or not the user eats meat. If the user clicked `OK`, the value stored in `isMeatEater` will be `true`, otherwise, if `Cancel` was clicked, the value will be `false`. 

    ```js
      if (isMeatEater) {
        alert("Here's a steak");
      }
      else {
        alert("Here's an Impossible burger!");
      }
    </script>
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):@TODO { DO WE END OUR REVIEWS WITH A QUESTION? }

    * ☝️ Why do we only need to pass `isMeatEater` to our conditional statement? 

    * 🙋 A conditional statement evalutes whether or not a condition is true or false. We don't need to use an operator to evaluate `isMeatEater` as the value it contains is a Boolean. 

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understanding this?@TODO { YES, WE DO! }

    * 🙋 @TODO We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [`if...else` MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 6. Instructor Demo: Iteration Arrays (5 min) 

@TODO USE THE FOLLOWING FOR BROWSER AND/OR COMMAND LINE DEMOS, RESPECTIVELY. REMOVE IF UNUSED
* Open `02-Iteration-Arrays/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 If we Inspect our application, we will see in the console it logs the names of four animals: 'Zebra', 'Rhino', 'Giraffe', 'Owl'

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 @TODO We used this to accomplish { X, Y, Z }, in { CORRESPONDING ASYNCHRONOUS LESSON PLAN }.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We will need to write `for` loops and select items from arrays.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We would refactor the four `console.log` statements in a `for` loop.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 7. Student Do: Iteration Arrays (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Iteration-Arrays`.

```md
    # Iteration, Arrays

    ## Instructions

    * Refactor the code to use a `for` loop to log the name of each animal in the `zooAnimals` array rather than logging each item individually.


    ## Bonus

    What is DRY?
```


### 8. Instructor Review: Iteration Arrays (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ Accessing array items by index

    * ✔️ Iteration using a `for` loop

* Open `02-Iteration-Arrays/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 To refactor our program, we implement a `for` loop. We set the length of the iteration to the lenght of our array.

    ```js
    for (var i = 0; i < zooAnimals.length; i++) {
    ```

    * 🔑 To log each animal name, we use the value stored in `i` in each iteration.

    ```js
        console.log(zooAnimals[i]);
    }
    ```


* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What if we wanted to increment by 2?

    * 🙋 We could increment using the assignment operator and specifying the value by which we want to increment. For example, `i+=2`. 

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understanding this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [Loops and iteration documentation on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 09. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

    * 🙋 We reviewed conditional control flow statements and iteration over arrays using `for` loops.

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful. 

    * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

    * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer. 

    * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

    * 🙋 @TODO { YES, WHERE? }

    * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Use student answers to transition to office hours.

### 10. Office Hours (30 min)

* Announce office hours and invite students to stay on the Zoom and start the challenge while they have live support from instructional staff.
