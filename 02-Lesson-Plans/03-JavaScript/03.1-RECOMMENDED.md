# Module 03 Virtual Class (Recommended): JavaScript

## Overview 

In today's virtual class session, students will { OUTLINE THE CAREER CONNECTION TOPIC }, as well as review conditional statements and iteration. 


## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Explain what technical interviewing is

* Implement some technical interviewing strategies for success

* Implement conditional control flow using `if`, `else` and `elseif` statements.

* Implement array iteration using `for` loops.


## Instructor Notes

* Today's activities are simple and straightforward. Use any remaining or extra time to demonstrate alternative solutions or review other programming concepts. 

* Students will struggle with different aspects of programming. Be sure to reinforce both foundational concepts as well as syntax. 

* These activities will reference the first two lessons of the module regarding: conditional statements used to check the state of the robots' health and iteration through arrays used to face the enemy robots in the `enemyNames` array.

## Class Instructions 

### 1. Introduction (5 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Direct students to post individual questions in the Zoom chat to be addressed by TAs and/or at the end of class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

    * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back and see what we accomplished, and acknowledge that it's a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic? 

    * 🙋 Let's do "fist to five" together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).


### 2. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What is the first step to getting a job in web development?

    * 🙋 We need to apply!

    * ☝️ What is the interview process for web development? 

    * 🙋 Every interview process is different and largely depends on the company. The interviewing process for web development roles are much more rigorous than we are accustomed. However, as a general rule, we can expect to go through several rounds, including technical and behavioral interviews.

    * ☝️ The first interview is often HR or recruiting agency pre-screen call. What's the purpose of this interview?

    * 🙋 Someone from Human Resources or a recruiting agency will hold a brief 10-15 minute phone call interview to give an overview of the role, ask about experience, and oftentimes salary expectations.

    * ☝️ If the pre-screen call goes well, the next interview is most likely with the hiring manager? What is the purpose of this interview? 

    * 🙋 The hiring manager is likely to ask questions about experience with specific technologies that are relevant to the position.

    * ☝️ If the interview with the hiring manager goes well, the next interview is most likely technical. What is a technical interview?

    * 🙋 The technical portion of the interview might be an in-person whiteboarding format, or it might be through an online assessment platform such as HackerRank, to assess technical proficiency.

    * ☝️ If the technical interview goes well, the next interview is likely behavioral? What is the purpose of the behavioral interview? 

    * 🙋 This interview is usually used to gauge cultural and personality fit with the team.

    * ☝️ If the behavioral interview goes well, what is the likely next step?

    * 🙋 The next step is likely an offer detailing the compensation package, including salary, benefits and bonus. 

    * ☝️ Did anyone attempt the Code Signal algorithm? 

* Use student answers to transition to the next activity.

* Open your IDE and review the solution to the Code Signal algorithm: 

    * This algorithm is 'Add Two Digits'. We are given a two-digit integer `n`. Return the sum of its digits.

    * For example, if `n = 29`, the output should be `addTwoDigits(n) = 11`.

    * The instructions provide the following details regarding input and output:
    ```md
        **[execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)**

        **[input] integer n**

        A positive two-digit integer.

        Guaranteed constraints:
        `10 ≤ n ≤ 99`.

        **[output] integer**

        The sum of the first and second digits of the input number.
    ```

    * We are also provided the following starter code: 
    ```js
    function addTwoDigits(n) {

    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What is the first step to solve this problem?

    * 🙋 In order to add two digits, we need to separate the two digit number into two values. 

    * ☝️ How would we do that? 

    * 🙋 If we convert the number to a string, we can access the values by index.

    ```js
    var stringNum = n.toString();
    ```

    * ☝️  If we converted our number to a string, how can we add the values as numbers? 

    * 🙋 We can use `parseInt()` to convert a string to a number. 
    ```js
    return parseInt(stringNum[0]) + parseInt(stringNum[1]);
    ```

    * ☝️ Why do we need to use `parseInt()`? 

    * 🙋 If we don't convert the values of `stringNum` back to numbers, they will simply be concatenated as another string.

* Answer any questions students have before moving to the next activity.


### 3. Instructor Demo: Conditional Statements (5 min) 

* Open `01-Conditional-Statements/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 When we open our application in the browser, we are asked to confirm whether or not we eat meat.

    * 🔑 If we click `OK`, we receive an alert about a cheese burger. If we click `Cancel`, we receive an alert about an Impossible burger.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋We used conditional statements in lesson 1 to check on the state of the robot's health. 

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We will need to get user input and use it with conditional statements. 

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We would first scaffold a boilerplate HTML file, then add a `<script>` tag containing JavaScript. Next we would assign the value of a `confirm()` to a variable and use a conditional statement to check whether or not the value is true or false. Lastly, we alert the user their burger of choice.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 4. Student Do: Conditional Statements (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-Conditional-Statements/Solved/index.html`.

```md
    # Conditional Statements

    ## Instructions

    * Create a site (from scratch) that asks users if they eat steak.

    * If they respond with "yes", alert the following to the page: "Here’s a cheese burger!"

    * If they respond with "no", alert the following to the page: "Here’s an Impossible burger!"
```


### 5. Instructor Review: Conditional Statements (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ The `<script>` tag

    * ✔️ Variable declaration and value assignment

    * ✔️ `if` and `else`

* Open `01-Conditional-Statements/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 To add JavaScript to our application, we need to use the `<script>` tag.

    ```html
    <script type="text/javascript">
    ```

    * 🔑 Within our `<script>` tag, we declare a variable, `isMeatEater`, and assign it the value of the user input from `confirm()`. 

    ```js
      var isMeatEater = confirm('Do you eat meat?');
    ```

    * 🔑 We then evaluate whether or not the user eats meat. If the user clicked `OK`, the value stored in `isMeatEater` will be `true`, otherwise, if `Cancel` was clicked, the value will be `false`. 

    ```js
      if (isMeatEater) {
        alert("Here's a steak");
      }
      else {
        alert("Here's an Impossible burger!");
      }
    </script>
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Why do we only need to pass `isMeatEater` to our conditional statement? 

    * 🙋 A conditional statement evaluates whether or not a condition is true or false. We don't need to use an operator to evaluate `isMeatEater` as the value it contains is a Boolean. 

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understanding this?@TODO { YES, WE DO! }

    * 🙋 @TODO We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [`if...else` MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 6. Instructor Demo: Iteration Arrays (5 min) 

@TODO USE THE FOLLOWING FOR BROWSER AND/OR COMMAND LINE DEMOS, RESPECTIVELY. REMOVE IF UNUSED
* Open `02-Iteration-Arrays/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 If we Inspect our application, we will see in the console it logs the names of four animals: 'Zebra', 'Rhino', 'Giraffe', 'Owl'

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used a `for` loop to iterate through an array in lesson 2 to find new enemy robots to fight once we have defeated one.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We will need to write `for` loops and select items from arrays.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We would refactor the four `console.log` statements in a `for` loop.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 7. Student Do: Iteration Arrays (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Iteration-Arrays`.

```md
    # Iteration, Arrays

    ## Instructions

    * Refactor the code to use a `for` loop to log the name of each animal in the `zooAnimals` array rather than logging each item individually.


    ## Bonus

    What is DRY?
```


### 8. Instructor Review: Iteration Arrays (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ Accessing array items by index

    * ✔️ Iteration using a `for` loop

* Open `02-Iteration-Arrays/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 To refactor our program, we implement a `for` loop. We set the length of the iteration to the lenght of our array.

    ```js
    for (var i = 0; i < zooAnimals.length; i++) {
    ```

    * 🔑 To log each animal name, we use the value stored in `i` in each iteration.

    ```js
        console.log(zooAnimals[i]);
    }
    ```


* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What if we wanted to increment by 2?

    * 🙋 We could increment using the assignment operator and specifying the value by which we want to increment. For example, `i+=2`. 

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understanding this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [Loops and iteration documentation on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 09. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

    * 🙋 We reviewed conditional control flow statements and iteration over arrays using `for` loops.

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful. 

    * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

    * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer. 

    * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

    * 🙋 Lesson 2 has examples of conditional statements and `for` loops to iterate through arrays.

    * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Use student answers to transition to office hours.

### 10. Office Hours (30 min)

* Announce office hours and invite students to stay on the Zoom and start the challenge while they have live support from instructional staff.
