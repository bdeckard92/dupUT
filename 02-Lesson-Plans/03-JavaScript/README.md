# Module 03 Instructor Overview: JavaScript

## Overview

In this module, students will learn the foundations of JavaScript, one of the three core technologies of web development. Whereas HTML is used for the content of a website and CSS is used for styling, JavaScript handles logic. This module teaches students logical problem-solving skills, and it also introduces them to loops, conditionals, functions, and built-in JavaScript Objects. These skills are needed not only for a solid understanding of JavaScript but other programming languages as well.

In this week's virtual classes, you'll introduce **weekly algorithms** that students will complete to prepare for technical interviews. In terms of the module content, you will review conditional statements, iteration, functions, arrays, generating random values, prompts, and alerts.

| Day | Topic                                 | Module    |
| --- | ------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1   | Conditional Statements                | 3.1       |
| 1   | Iteration                             | 3.2       |
| 2   | Functions                             | 3.1       |
| 2   | Scope                                 | 3.1       |
| 2   | Object-This                           | 3.1 - 3.4 |

## Overview of Asynchronous Material

Why are students learning JavaScript?

* JavaScript is the most important language used in web development.

* Learning JavaScript prepares students for understanding computer science concepts by introducing them to loops, conditionals, and functions.

* JavaScript gives students the tools to build interactive web applications.

* JavaScript empowers students to solve complex problems with logic.

* JavaScript prepares students for an easy transition to back-end development when they begin using Node.js.

Throughout the async module this week, students will use JavaScript to do the following:

* Identify and declare variables containing primitive and object data types in JavaScript.

* Write `for` loops to iterate over strings and arrays.

* Write conditional statements using `if...else` and `switch` statements.

* Explain the importance of objects in JavaScript and create objects that contain both properties and methods.

* Explain and implement the difference between function declarations and expressions.

* Explain and implement comparison and logical operators.

**Reminder**: If students need help with an async activity, encourage them to attend Office Hours for help! If you can’t get through all of it, remind them that they can lean on Learning Assistants with the AskBCS bot for more help.

| Lesson | Description                                | Key Points                                                                        |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1      | JavaScript Basics                          | JavaScript functions, variables, logical operators, conditional statements        |
| 2      | Use Loops to Enable Multiple Battle Rounds | `for` loops, iteration of arrays of elements, controlling data flow, debugging    |
| 3      | Expand Game Logic into Multiple Functions  | Organizing code using functions, control flow with functions, scoping               |
| 4      | Optimize the Code with Objects             | Creating objects and methods, JavaScript built-in objects, `return` keyword       |
| 5      | Resolve Bugs and Add Final Enhancements    | GitHub issues, sanitizing input, fixing bugs, data persistence with local storage |

## Virtual Classes

* [Virtual Class 03.1](./03.1-REQUIRED.md)

* [Virtual Class 03.2](./03.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* The jump from HTML and CSS to JavaScript can be challenging for students. Be prepared to answer a lot of questions and use Office Hours to review programming fundamentals.

### Common Pain Points

According to our class data, students might experience some of the following pain points throughout the week:

| Pain Point                        | Recommendation                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scoping                           | Provide examples of function scope vs. global scope. Refer to the [MDN Web Docs on scope](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scope).                                 |
| Order of operations               | Provide a brief overview of the concurrency model. Refer to the [MDN Web Docs on concurrency](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop).                    |
| Different syntax in documentation | Advise students that they will see different syntax for the same operation as a result of ECMAScript versioning. Advise students that we will start with ES5 and later move into ES6. |

## Career Connection

During each lesson that students work through, they will also view a Career Connection section that will tie together the academic content with Career Services and how this material will be applicable to them in their future career.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Director and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careerservicesonlineevents.splashthat.com/).

If you'd like more information on Career Services, visit the [Career Services resources page](https://mycareerspot.org/).

## Module Challenge

Students will modify starter code to build a password generator using JavaScript for this week's Challenge. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS, powered by the JavaScript code that students create. It will also feature a clean, responsive user interface, ensuring compatibility with multiple screen sizes.

[Module 03 Challenge](../../01-Class-Content/03-JavaScript/02-Challenge)

Specific skills students will need to implement to be successful:

* Organizing logical operations into functions

* Iterating through alphanumeric characters

* Dynamically rendering data to the page using JavaScript

* Creating event listeners for page elements

* Pushing to arrays

* Rendering data to the DOM

## Heads-Up

Next week, you will cover in-browser Web APIs that you can access through JavaScript. You will also cover traversing the DOM and creating elements dynamically.
