## Instructor Notes

* This week's Career Connection is on the topic of interview process. Use the prompts to facilitate a discussion. Feel free to share your personal experience. Use the remaining time to review one of this week's algorithms. 

* The jump from HTML and CSS to JavaScript can be challenging for students. Be prepared to answer a lot of questions and use Office Hours to review programming fundamentals.

## Heads-Up

Next week, you will review "vanilla JS" Web APIs. If this is new to you or you generally use a library or framework for front-end development, you will want to find time to review activities and research DOM methods.
