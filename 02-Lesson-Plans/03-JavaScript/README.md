# Module 03 Instructor Overview: JavaScript

## Overview

In this week's virtual classes, you'll introduce **weekly algorithms** that students will complete in order to prepare for technical interviews. In terms of module content, you will review conditional statements, iteration, functions, arrays, generating random values, prompts, and alerts.

## Overview of Asynchronous Material

Why are students learning JavaScript?

* JavaScript is the most important language used in web development.
* Learning JavaScript primes your brain for understanding computer science concepts.
* JavaScript makes web applications fully interactive.
* JavaScript allows us to preform logical operations in the browser.
* JavaScript is fun!

Throughout the async module this week, students will use JavaScript to do the following:

* Identify and declare variables containing primitive and object data types in JavaScript
* Write for loops to iterate over strings and arrays
* Write conditional statements using if/else and switch statements
* Explain the importance of objects in JavaScript and create objects that contain both properties and methods
* Explain and implement the difference between function declarations and expressions
* Explain and implement comparison and logical operators

**Reminder:** If students need help with an async activity, encourage them to attend Office Hours for help! If you can’t get through all of it, remind them that they can lean on Learning Assistants with the AskBCS bot for more help.

| Lesson | Description        | Key Points                                                                        |
| ------ | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1.     | Basics             | JavaScript functions, variables, logical operators, conditional statements        |
| 2.     | Loops              | `for` loops, iteration of arrays of elements, controlling data flow, debugging    |
| 3.     | Multiple Functions | Organize code using functions, control flow with functions, scoping               |
| 4.     | Objects            | Creating objects and methods, JavaScript built-in objects, `return` keyword       |
| 5.     | Bugs               | GitHub issues, sanitizing input, fixing bugs, data persistence with local storage |

## Virtual Classes

If your class started AFTER January 1, 2021, use these lesson plans:

* [Virtual Class 03.1](./03.1-REQUIRED.md)

* [Virtual Class 03.2](./03.2-REQUIRED.md)

If your class started BEFORE January 1, 2021, use these lesson plans:

* [Virtual Class (Recommended) 03.1](./03.1-RECOMMENDED.md)

* [Virtual Class (Required) 03.2](./03.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* The jump from HTML and CSS to JavaScript can be challenging for students. Be prepared to answer a lot of questions and use Office Hours to review programming fundamentals.

### Common Pain Points

According to our class data, students might experience some of the following pain points throughout the week:

| Pain Point                          | Recommendation       |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| {COMMON PAIN POINT FOR THIS MODULE} | {RECOMMENDED ACTION} |
| {COMMON PAIN POINT FOR THIS MODULE} | {RECOMMENDED ACTION} |

## Career Connection

During each lesson that students work through, they will also view a Career Connection section that will tie together the academic content with Career Services and how this material will be applicable to them in their future career.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Director and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careerservicesonlineevents.splashthat.com/).

If you'd like more information on Career Services, visit the [Career Services resources page](https://mycareerspot.org/).

## Module Challenge

Students will build a password generator using JavaScript for this week's challenge.

[Module 03 Challenge](../../01-Class-Content/03-Javascript/02-Challenge)

Specific skills students will need to implement in order to be successful:

* Organizing logical operations into functions.
* Iteration through alphanumeric characters.
* Pushing to arrays
* Rendering data to the DOM

## Heads-Up

Next week, you will review "vanilla JS" Web APIs. If this is new to you or you generally use a library or framework for front-end development, you will want to find time to review activities and research DOM methods.
