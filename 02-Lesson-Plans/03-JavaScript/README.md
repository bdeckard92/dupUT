# Module 03 Instructor Overview: JavaScript

## Overview

In this week's virtual classes, you'll introduce **weekly algorithms** that students will complete in order to prepare for technical interviews. In terms of module content, you will review conditional statements, iteration, functions, arrays, generating random values, prompts, and alerts. 

## Virtual Classes

If your class started **AFTER** January 1, 2021, use these lesson plans:

* [Virtual Class 03.1](./03.1-REQUIRED.md)

* [Virtual Class 03.2](./03.2-REQUIRED.md)

If your class started **BEFORE** January 1, 2021, use these lesson plans:

* [Virtual Class (Recommended) 03.1](./03.1-RECOMMENDED.md)

* [Virtual Class (Required) 03.2](./03.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* The jump from HTML and CSS to JavaScript can be challenging for students. Be prepared to answer a lot of questions and use Office Hours to review programming fundamentals.

## Career Connection

During each lesson that students work through, they will also view a Career Connection section that will tie together the academic content with Career Services and how this material will be applicable to them in their future career.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Director and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careerservicesonlineevents.splashthat.com/).

## Heads-Up

Next week, you will review "vanilla JS" Web APIs. If this is new to you or you generally use a library or framework for front-end development, you will want to find time to review activities and research DOM methods.
