# Module 03 Instructor Overview: JavaScript

## Overview

In this module, students learn the foundations of JavaScript, one of the three core technologies of web development (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). While HTML is used for the content of a website and CSS is used for styling, JavaScript handles the computational logic. This module gives students a lot of practice with logical problem-solving, and it also introduces them to loops, conditionals, functions, and built-in JavaScript objects. These skills will not only give students a solid understanding of JavaScript, they will allow them to more easily learn other object-oriented programming languages as well.

In this week's virtual classes, you'll introduce **weekly algorithms**, which students will complete to help prepare for technical interviews. In terms of the module content, you will review conditional statements, iteration, functions, scope, objects, and the `this` keyword.

The following table maps the key topics covered in the virtual lessons to where they are taught in the asynchronous content:

| Day | Topic                                 | Module    |
| --- | ------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1   | Conditional statements                | 3.1       |
| 1   | Iteration                             | 3.2       |
| 2   | Functions                             | 3.1       |
| 2   | Scope                                 | 3.3       |
| 2   | Object-this                           | 3.4       |

## Overview of Asynchronous Material

Why are students learning JavaScript?

* JavaScript is the most important language used in web development.

* Learning JavaScript prepares students to understand computer science concepts by introducing them to loops, conditionals, and functions.

* JavaScript gives students the tools to build interactive web applications.

* JavaScript empowers students to solve complex problems using logic.

* JavaScript prepares students for an easy transition to back-end development when they begin using Node.js.

Throughout the async module this week, students will use JavaScript to do the following:

* Identify and declare variables that contain primitive and object data types in JavaScript.

* Write `for` loops to iterate over strings and arrays.

* Write conditional statements using `if...else` and `switch` statements.

* Explain the importance of objects in JavaScript and create objects that contain both properties and methods.

* Explain and implement the difference between function declarations and expressions.

* Explain and implement comparison and logical operators.

**Reminder**: If students need help with an async activity, encourage them to attend Office Hours. If they need more help, remind them that they can use Learning Assistants via the AskBCS bot.

The following table contains a description of each lesson's portion of the module project and the corresponding key points that are taught:

| Lesson | Description                                | Key Points                                                                        |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1      | JavaScript basics                          | JavaScript functions, variables, logical operators, conditional statements        |
| 2      | Use loops to enable multiple battle rounds | `for` loops, iteration of arrays of elements, controlling data flow, debugging    |
| 3      | Expand game logic into multiple functions  | Organizing code using functions, control flow with functions, scoping             |
| 4      | Optimize the code with objects             | Creating objects and methods, JavaScript built-in objects, `return` keyword       |
| 5      | Resolve bugs and add final enhancements    | GitHub issues, sanitizing input, fixing bugs, data persistence with local storage |

## Virtual Classes

Here are the lesson plans for this week's virtual classes:

* [Virtual Class 03.1](./03.1-REQUIRED.md)

* [Virtual Class 03.2](./03.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

Here are some things to keep in mind as you prepare for this week's virtual classes:

* The jump from HTML and CSS to JavaScript can be challenging for students. Be prepared to answer a lot of questions and use Office Hours to review programming fundamentals.

### Common Pain Points

According to our class data, students might experience some of the following pain points throughout the week:

| Pain Point                        | Recommendation                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scoping                           | Provide examples of function scope vs. global scope. Refer to the [MDN Web Docs on scope](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scope).                                 |
| Order of operations               | Provide a brief overview of the concurrency model. Refer to the [MDN Web Docs on concurrency](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop).                    |
| Varying syntax in documentation | Advise students that they will see different syntax for the same operation as a result of ECMAScript versioning. Let them know that we will start with ES5 and later move into ES6. |

## Career Connection

Each virtual lesson contains a Career Connection section that links the academic content with career services and students' future careers.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Coach and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for career services workshops](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp).

If you'd like more information about career services, visit the [career services resources page](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp/).

## Module Challenge

In the [Module 03 Challenge](../../01-Class-Content/03-JavaScript/02-Challenge), students will modify JavaScript starter code to build a password generator. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS, powered by the JavaScript code that students create. It will also feature a clean, responsive user interface to ensure compatibility with multiple screen sizes.

Students must know how to implement the following skills in order to succeed in this week's Challenge:

* Organizing logical operations into functions

* Iterating through alphanumeric characters

* Dynamically rendering data to the page using JavaScript

* Creating event listeners for page elements

* Pushing to arrays

* Rendering data to the DOM

## Heads-Up

Next week, you will cover in-browser Web APIs that can be accessed through JavaScript. You will also cover traversing the DOM and creating elements dynamically.
