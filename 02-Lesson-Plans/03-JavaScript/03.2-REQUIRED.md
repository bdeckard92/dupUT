## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What did you learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

    * We learned programming fundamentals in JavaScript, such as conditional statements, iteration, functions and data types. We are moving fast compared to traditional learners. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ Did anyone have an "Aha!" or "Eureka!" moment this week? When was it and why did things suddenly click for you? 

    * 🙋 Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we're thinking about it.

    * ☝️ Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

    * 🙋 It's easy to get stuck when you're learning web development. It's important to learn how to get unstuck because it happens to the pros too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the tool's official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups are great because explaining your problems to someone else often reveals the solution. 


### 2. Review Current Challenge (5 min)

* Open `01-Class-Content/03-JavaScript/02-Challenge/Masterr/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

    * The challenge is a password generator. When we click the `Generate Password` button, we are prompted to enter a number of characters, use of special and numeric characters, and upper- and lowercase letters.

    * After confirming the series of prompts, a password is generated.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What recently acquired skills will help us build this challenge?

    * 🙋 JavaScript! We will need to get input from the user using prompts and confirms, generate random numbers, and iterate over arrays of characters. 

    * ☝️ How are these skills relevant to a career in web development?

    * 🙋 First, it's important to have a good password. Second, processing user input and returning an output is inherent in any interactive web application.

    * ☝️ How will this challenge improve your portfolio?

    * 🙋 It will demonstrate understanding of JavaScript fundamentals as well as the importance of a good password.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 3. Instructor Demo: Iteration, Random (5 min) 

* Open `03-Stu_Iteration-Random/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 When we open our console, we see that 10 random numbers are logged.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 @TODO We used this to accomplish { X, Y, Z }, in { CORRESPONDING ASYNCHRONOUS LESSON PLAN }.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 Our password generator will need random values.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We could create 10 distinct random values and log each of them. Or, we can use a `for` loop that logs a random value with each iteration.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 4. Student Do: Iteration, Random  (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `03-Stu_Iteration-Random`.

```md
    # Iteration, Random

    ## Instructions

    * From scratch, create a simple 'site' that logs 10 random numbers using a `for` loop and `Math.random()`


    ## Hint(s)

    * `Math.random()` returns a decimal (or _floating point_) number. How will you convert it to a whole number?
```


### 5. Instructor Review: Iteration, Random  (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ Iteration using a `for` loop

    * ✔️ `Math.random()`

    * ✔️ `Math.floor()`

* Open `03-Stu_Iteration-Random/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 We first create a `for` loop and set the value of the condition to `10`.

    ```js
    <script type="text/javascript">
      // Loop 10 times
      for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    ```

    * 🔑 Next, we declare a variable `num` and generate a value between 0 and 10 using `Math.random() * 10`. We pass that value to `Math.floor()` to round down to a whole number. 

    ```js
        var num = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;
    ```

    * Lastly, we log the value in `num`.

    ```js
        // Display in console
        console.log(num);
      }
    </script>
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Why do we add 1 to the value returned by `Math.floor()`?

    * 🙋 To ensure that the value is between 1 and 10.

    * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [MDN Math docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 6. Instructor Demo: Functions (5 min) 

* Open `04-Functions/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

    * This demo uses functions to create and return values. 
    
    * 🔑 If we inspect our console, we see that the results of the function calls are logged.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 @TODO We used this to accomplish { X, Y, Z }, in { CORRESPONDING ASYNCHRONOUS LESSON PLAN }.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We will want to write functions to make our code DRY.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We will need to write function declarations or expressions and log the returned values.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 7. Student Do: Functions (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Functions`.

```md
    # Functions

    ## Instructions

    * Create a function, `adder()`, that accepts three arguments and returns their sum.

    * Create a function, `muliplier()`, that accepts three arguments and returns their product. 

    * Create a function, `isString()`, that accepts three arguments and checks if the type of all three is string.

    * Create a function, `vowelCheker()`, that accepts one argument, a string, and checks if the first letter of the string is a vowel. 


    ## Hint(s) 

    * How do check the _type of_ a value?

    * How do you check the _character at_ a given position in a string?
```


### 8. Instructor Review: Functions (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ Function declarations

    * ✔️ `return`

    * ✔️ Assigning function return value to a variable

          // If not... it will log that.
          return 'First letter is NOT a vowel. *sadface*';
        }
      }

      var sum = adder(1, 2, 3);

      console.log('The result of adder() is ' + sum);

      var product = multiplier(2, 3, 4);

      console.log('The result of multiplier() is ' + product);

      var stringCheckOne = isString('Jared', 'Bad', 'Monkey');

      console.log(stringCheckOne);

### 12. Recap & Promote Additional Resources (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What do you think you absolutely need to know to succeed at the challenge?

    * 🙋 To complete the challenge, we need to know how to get and store user input using prompts and confirms. We also need to know how to generate random numbers, select items from arrays, and implement control flow using functions, iterations and conditional statements.

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it is not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful. 

    * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material prior to class as possible?

    * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

* Direct students to the additional resources available to them:

    * Reflection and Retrieval

    * Career Connection

    * Dessert Menu

### 13. Introduce Upcoming Challenge (5 min)

* Open `01-Class-Content/04-Web-APIs/02-Challenge/Masterr/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

    * The upcoming challenge is a "code quiz".

    * When we click 'Start', we are presented with a series of questions and a timer begins counting down. 

    * If we get an answer wrong, 15 seconds are subtracted from the timer.

    * After answering all questions, we are prompted to enter our name in a form. If we close and reopen the browser, we can view the high score by clicking the 'View Highscores' link in the upper left. 

    * 📝 It's not required, but selecting an answer generates sounds for correct and incorrect.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What are we learning?

    * 🙋 We are learning how to handle and respond to clicks, dynamically generate HTML, set a timer, and store data in the browser.

    * ☝️ How does this project build off or extend previously learned material?

    * 🙋 We will need to implement the all of our recently acquired programming fundamentals to complete this challenge.

    * ☝️ How does this project relate to your career goals?

    * 🙋 It's a code challenge in two ways: 1) the questions reinforce your understanding of fundamental concepts; 2) the challenge itself demonstrates understanding of how HTML, CSS and JavaScript work together in the browser. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 14. Office Hours (30 min)

* Announce office hours and encourage students to stay on the Zoom and start the challenge while they have live support from instructional staff.
