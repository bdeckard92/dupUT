# 03.2 Virtual Class: JavaScript

## Overview

In today's virtual class, you will review functions, scope, objects, and the `this` keyword. You will also introduce the upcoming Challenge.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Write a function expression and a function declaration.

* Identify the difference between global and local scope.

* Use JavaScript object methods.

* Explain and use the `this` keyword.

## Instructor Notes

* Take a few minutes before class to review the activities of the day and think about questions that students who are new to JavaScript might ask.

* In the `04-Scope` activity, students will work with a partner to debug some broken code and learn more about scope and shadowing. This is a challenging activity, especially for learners new to programming languages. Review the solution code before class and try to anticipate questions that might arise. If need be, review the [MDN Web Docs on scope](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scope) so that you can confidently answer students' questions.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly, ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity, and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Functions are introduced in Lesson 1 and Scope is discussed in Lesson 4. Objects and the `this` keyword are demonstrated in Lesson 3.

## Office Hours

Encourage students to work on the remaining module algorithms during Office Hours, and review the algorithm solutions 5–10 minutes before class begins.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What did you learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

  * We learned JavaScript programming fundamentals, such as conditional statements, iteration, functions, and data types. We are moving fast compared to traditional learners. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed, as long as we don’t give up!

  * ☝️ Did anyone have an "A-ha!" or "Eureka!" moment this week? When was it and why did things suddenly click for you?

  * 🙋 Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we're thinking about it.

  * ☝️ Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

  * 🙋 It's easy to get stuck when you're learning web development. It's important to learn how to get unstuck because it happens to the pros too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the tool's official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups are great because explaining your problems to someone else often reveals the solution.

### 2. Review Current Challenge (5 min)

* Open `02-Challenge/Main/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * The Challenge is a password generator. When we click the Generate Password button, we are prompted to enter a number of characters, using special and numeric characters, and uppercase and lowercase letters.

  * After confirming the series of prompts, a password is generated.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Which recently acquired skills will help us build this Challenge?

  * 🙋 JavaScript! We will need to get input from the user using prompts and confirms, generate random numbers, and iterate over arrays of characters.

  * ☝️ How are these skills relevant to a career in web development?

  * 🙋 First, it's important to have a strong password. Second, processing user input and returning an output is inherent in any interactive web application.

  * ☝️ How will this Challenge improve your portfolio?

  * 🙋 It will demonstrate an understanding of JavaScript fundamentals as well as the importance of a good password.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 3. Instructor Demo: Functions (5 min)

* Open `03-Functions/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We create reusable blocks of code using functions.

  * 🔑 One way we can define a function is to use a **function declaration**. A function declaration starts with the keyword `function` followed by a name and parentheses `()`.

    ```js
    function isEqual(x, y)
    ```

  * 🔑 The block of code that we want to execute goes in curly brackets `{}`. After the code we want to execute, we use `return`. The return statement stops the execution of the function.

    ```js
    function isEqual(x, y) {
      if (x === y) {
        console.log('They are equal in type and value');
      } else if (x == y) {
        console.log('They are equal in value');
      } else {
        console.log('They are not equal');
      }
      return;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 We can also use `var` to declare a function expression. After the assignment operator `=`, we use `function` followed by parentheses `()`. Just like before, the code block goes inside curly brackets `{}` and `return` is used.

    ```js
    var isEqualTakeTwo = function (x, y) {
      if (x === y) {
        console.log('They are equal in type and value');
      } else if (x == y) {
        console.log('They are equal in value');
      } else {
        console.log('They are not equal');
      }
      return;
    };
    ```

  * 🔑 Functions can also take parameters. Parameters allow us to pass values into a function by giving the values a name. The values that we want to use in the code block are given the names `x` and `y`.

    ```js
    function isEqual(x, y)
    ```

  * 🔑 Adding parameters inside the `()` only gives them names -- not values. The values are assigned when the function is called. So in the following example, `x` has been assigned `7`, `y` has been assigned `"Hello"`, and `z` has been assigned `true`:

    ```js
    isEqual(10, 10);
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We learned about functions in Lesson 1.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

  * 🙋 Functions are the essential building blocks of our code. We will use functions in the Challenge and throughout the course to create a reusable block of code that performs a specific function.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We can use either function declaration or a function expression to declare functions. Declaring a function only gives a block of code a name. To execute it, we have to call it every time we want the action performed.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Functions (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `03-Functions/README.md`, which are also shown here:

  ```md
  # 📖 Write Function to Evaluate Equality of Two Values

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to know when two values are equal to one another.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It is done when I provide two values in function arguments and the function evaluates the values' equality.

  * It is done if, when the values are strictly equal, the message "They are equal in type and value" is logged.

  * It is done if, when the two values are equal but not strictly equal, the message "They are equal in value" is logged.

  * It is done if, when the values are not equal or strictly equal, the message "The values are not equal" is logged.

  ## 📝 Notes

  Refer to the documentation:

  [MDN Web Docs on functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions)

  ## 💡 Hints

  How can we use parameters to give a name to the two values that we want to evaluate using the function?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What is hoisting?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 5. Instructor Review: Functions (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `function myFunc(){}`

  * ✔️ Parameters

  * ✔️ `return`

  * ✔️ `myFunc()`

  * ✔️ Function expressions

* Open `03-Functions/Solved/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 To create a function declaration, we start with the keyword `function` and give it a name, `isEqual`. Then, inside the parentheses`()`, we provide two parameters, `x` and `y`, in order to provide a name for the two values we want the function to evaluate.

    ```js
    function isEqual(x,y)
    ```

  * We use an `if` statement to evaluate whether the values are strictly equal. If so, the message `"They are equal in type and value"` will log in the console.

    ```js
    if (x === y) {
      console.log("They are equal in type and value");
    }
    ```

  * If the two values are not strictly equal, we check whether they are equal in value only by using `==`. We add an `else if` statement that will log `"They are equal in value"` if `x == y` evaluates to `true`.

    ```js
    } else if (x == y) {
      console.log("They are equal in value");
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 We use an `else` statement to log a message if the two values are not strictly equal or equal. We also add a `return` to stop the execution of the function.

    ```js
    } else {
      console.log("They are not equal");
    }
      return;
    ```

  * 🔑 We execute the block of code by calling it using its name. Inside the parentheses, we put the two values we want to assign to `x` and `y` when the function runs.

    ```js
    isEqual(10, 10);
    ```

  * 🔑 We can also use a function expression to execute the same block of code. A function expression starts with `var`.

    ```js
    var isEqualTakeTwo = function (x,y) {
        if (x === y) {
          console.log("They are equal in type and value");
        } else if (x == y) {
          console.log("They are equal in value");
        } else {
          console.log("They are not equal");
        }
        return;
    };
    ```

* Open `03-Functions/Solved/index.html` in your browser and navigate to the console to demonstrate the following:

  * When a function is called, the values assigned inside the parentheses `()` are used to execute the code.

  * So when we assign the values `10` and `10`, the message `"They are equal in type and value"` logs to the console.

  * When we assign the values `10` and `true`, the message `"They are not equal"` logs.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How can using functions improve code?

  * 🙋 Functions are reusable blocks of code that we can execute again and again. Using functions makes code cleaner and more modular.

  * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to the lessons, read the [MDN Web Docs on functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions), and attend Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Scope (5 min)

* Open `04-Scope/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We have been declaring variables outside of the functions. Variables declared outside of a function, like in the following example, are **globally scoped**:

    ```js
    var shout = "Shout";
    ```

  * A variable in the global scope can be used throughout your code in any function or script. Because the value stored in the variable `Shout` is declared in the global scope, it can be used in this function as well as in other functions throughout your code.

    ```js
    function justShout() {
      console.log(shout + ", " + shout);
      return;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 Declaring a variable inside a function changes the scope of the variable to **local scope**. A locally scoped variable can only be accessed inside that function.

    ```js
    function sayLions() {
      var animal = "Lions";
      console.log(animal);
      return;
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We used scope in Lesson 3.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

  * 🙋 It is important to know if our variables are globally or locally scoped so that we can get the expected output from our code.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 To use the global scope, we declare a variable outside a function. If a variable is declared inside the function, it is locally scoped.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Scope (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Scope/README.md`, which are also shown here:

  ```md
  # 🐛 Messages Not Logging to Console Due to Undefined Variables

  Work with a partner to resolve the following issues:

  * As a developer, I want to log messages to the console using variables declared in both global and local scope.

  ## Expected Behavior

  When the console is opened, a series of messages should log to the console.

  ## Actual Behavior

  When the console is opened, an error message indicates that at least one variable is undefined, and messages do not log.

  ## 💡 Hints

  Think about how the variable is being used. Is it being made available to all functions, or is it only being used by one function?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What is lexical scope?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 8. Instructor Review: Scope (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ Global scope

  * ✔️ Local scope

  * ✔️ Shadowing

* Open `04-Scope/Solved/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We declare the variable `shout` in the global scope so that it is available to all functions, including `justShout` and `shoutItAllOut`.

    ```js
    var shout = "Shout";

    function justShout() {
      console.log(shout + ", " + shout);
      return;
    }

    function shoutItAllOut() {
      console.log(shout + " it all out! ");
      return;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 The variable `animals` has been declared locally inside the `sayLions` function, so it is only available in that function.

    ```js
    function sayLions() {
      var animal = "Lions";
      console.log(animal);
      return;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 We declare the variable `animals` locally inside the `sayTigers` function. Because a locally scoped variable is only accessed in the function where it is declared, it doesn't change the value of the `animal` variable declared in `sayLions`. The `sayLions` function will use the value `Lions`, and the `sayTigers` function will use the value `Tigers`.

    ```js
    function sayTigers() {
      var animal = "Tigers";
      console.log("and " + animal + " and ");
      return;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 To avoid shadowing, or declaring a variable with the same name in the global and local scope, we remove the `bears` variable in the local scope so that the `sayBears` function will log `"Bears! OH MY!"`.

    ```js
    var bears = "Bears";

    function sayBears() {
      console.log(bears + "! OH MY!");
      return;
    }

    ```

  * We declare the variable `sing` inside the outer function so that the value of `sing` is available to everything inside the outer function, including the inner function. Shown in the following example, this is called a **nested function**.

    ```js
    function singAlong() {
      var sing = "Sing";
      console.log(sing + ",");
      var singASong = function () {
        console.log(sing + " a Song.");
      };
      singASong();
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why is it important to know if the variables are defined in the local or global scope?

  * 🙋 Scope tells us where the variables are accessible to use in our code. If we define the variables in the wrong scope, we will get errors!

  * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to the lessons, read the [MDN Web Docs on scope](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scope), and attend Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Instructor Demo: Object-This (5 min)

* Open `05-Object-This/Solved/index.html` in your browser and navigate to the console and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 When we log the keyword `this`, the `window` object is logged.

  * 🔑 The `window` object represents the browser's open window and has many properties, including methods.

* Open `05-Object-This/Solved/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * The `this` keyword refers to an object. The global object is the open browser window.

    ```js
    console.log(this);
    ```

  * We can also use `this` inside an object, such as `child`. In this case, the keyword `this` belongs to that object and is used to refer to the object's properties.

    ```js
    var child = {
      age: 10,
      ageTenYears: function() {
       console.log(this.age + 10);
     }
    };
    ```

  * Inside an object's method, `this` refers to the object that the method belongs to. In the following code, because `initialInvestment` belongs to the `investor` object, `this` refers to the value of `initialInvestment` inside the `investor` object, or 5000.

    ```js
    var investor = {
      name: "Cash Saver",
      investment: {
      initialInvestment: 5000,
      investmentGrowth: function() {
        console.log(this.initialInvestment * 1.15)
        }
      }
    };
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We used objects and the `this` keyword in Lesson 3.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

  * 🙋 This activity brings together several concepts needed to successfully complete the Challenge, including objects and the `this` keyword.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We declare an object using `var`. An object contains a list of properties and methods. The `this` keyword refers to the object it belongs to, and allows us to refer to other properties and methods inside the object.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 10. Student Do: Object-This (20 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `05-Object-This/README.md`, which are also shown here:

  ```md
  # 📐 Add Comments to Implementation of this

  Work with a partner to add comments that describe the functionality of the code found in [Unsolved](./Unsolved/script.js).

  ## Notes

  Refer to the documentation:

  [MDN Web Docs on this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this)

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What does the `window` object represent? Is the global object always the `window` object?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 11. Instructor Review: Object-This (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `this` in global context

  * ✔️ `this` in local context

  * ✔️ `this` in object method

* Open `05-Object-This/Solved/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 When we log the keyword `this` alone, the global object, or `window`, is logged.

    ```js
    console.log(this);
    ```

  * When we use `this` inside a function, `this` refers to the global object.

    ```js
    function helloThis() {
      console.log("Inside this function, this is " + this);
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 When we use `this` inside an object, `this` is local and belongs to that object.

    ```js
    var child = {
      age: 10,
      ageTenYears: function() {
        console.log(this.age + 10);
      }
    };
    ```

  * 🔑 When we use `this` in a nested object, `this` refers to the object where it is used, even if it is inside another object.

    ```js
    var investor = {
      name: "Cash Saver",
      investment: {
      initialInvestment: 5000,
      investmentGrowth: function() {
        console.log(this.initialInvestment * 1.15)
        }
      }
    };
    ```

  * 🔑 When we call an object's method, `this` still refers to the object the method belongs to, even when it is called outside the object.

    ```js
    child.ageTenYears();
    investor.investment.investmentGrowth();
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to the lessons, read the [MDN Web Docs on this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this), and attend Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 12. Recap & Promote Additional Resources (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What do you think you absolutely need to know to succeed at this week's Challenge?

  * 🙋 To complete the Challenge, we need to know how to get and store user input using prompts and confirms. We also need to know how to generate random numbers, select items from arrays, and implement control flow using functions, iterations, and conditional statements.

  * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

  * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it is not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful.

  * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material prior to class as possible?

  * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the Challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

* Direct students to the additional resources available to them:

  * Reflection and Retrieval

  * Career Connection

  * Dessert Menu

### 13. Introduce Upcoming Challenge (5 min)

* Open `01-Class-Content/04-Web-APIs/02-Challenge/Main/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * Next week's Challenge is a code quiz app in the browser.

  * When we click Start, we are presented with a series of questions, and a timer begins counting down.

  * If we get an answer wrong, 15 seconds are subtracted from the timer.

  * After answering all the questions, we are prompted to enter our name in a form. If we close and reopen the browser, we can view the high score by clicking the "View Highscores" link in the upper left.

  * 📝 It is not required, but selecting an answer can generate unique sounds for correct and incorrect!

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What will we be learning in the upcoming Challenge?

  * 🙋 We are learning how to handle and respond to clicks, dynamically generate HTML, set a timer, and store data in the browser.

  * ☝️ How does this project build on or extend previously learned material?

  * 🙋 We will need to implement the all of our recently acquired programming fundamentals to complete this Challenge.

  * ☝️ How does this project relate to your career goals?

  * 🙋 It's a code challenge in two ways: 1) the questions reinforce your understanding of fundamental concepts; 2) the challenge itself demonstrates an understanding of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript interact in the browser.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.
