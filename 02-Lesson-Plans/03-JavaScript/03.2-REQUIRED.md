# Module 03 Virtual Class: JavaScript

## Overview 

In today's virtual class, students will review iteration, `Math.random()`, and build a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game that will utilize many skills we learned this week, including functions, prompts and alerts, generating random values, selecting elements from an array, iteration, and conditional statements. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Generate random numbers using `Math.random()`

* Define and execute functions

* Integrate programming control flow fundamentals to create a simple game

## Instructor Notes 

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try and anticipate questions students may have.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* We iterated through arrays in Lesson 2 and we used the `Math.random()` function in Lesson 4 to add unpredictability to the battles between the robots.

## Office Hours

Encourage students to work on the remaining module algorithms during Office Hours. Review the algorithm solutions 5–10 minutes before class begins or during Office Hours after class.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What did you learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

  * We learned programming fundamentals in JavaScript, such as conditional statements, iteration, functions, and data types. We are moving fast compared to traditional learners. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

  * ☝️ Did anyone have an "Aha!" or "Eureka!" moment this week? When was it and why did things suddenly click for you? 

  * 🙋 Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we're thinking about it.

  * ☝️ Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

  * 🙋 It's easy to get stuck when you're learning web development. It's important to learn how to get unstuck because it happens to the pros too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the tool's official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups are great because explaining your problems to someone else often reveals the solution. 

### 2. Review Current Challenge (5 min)

* Open `02-Challenge/Main/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * The challenge is a password generator. When we click the `Generate Password` button, we are prompted to enter a number of characters, use of special and numeric characters, and upper- and lowercase letters.

  * After confirming the series of prompts, a password is generated.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What recently acquired skills will help us build this challenge?

  * 🙋 JavaScript! We will need to get input from the user using prompts and confirms, generate random numbers, and iterate over arrays of characters. 

  * ☝️ How are these skills relevant to a career in web development?

  * 🙋 First, it's important to have a good password. Second, processing user input and returning an output is inherent in any interactive web application.

  * ☝️ How will this challenge improve your portfolio?

  * 🙋 It will demonstrate understanding of JavaScript fundamentals as well as the importance of a good password.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 3. Instructor Demo: Iteration Random (5 min) 

* Open `03-Iteration-Random/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 When we open our console, we see that 10 random numbers are logged.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We iterated through an array in lesson 2 to battle the enemy robots in the `enemyNames` array. We also used the `Math.random()` function in lesson 4, to add unpredictability to the robot battle rounds. 

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  * 🙋 Our password generator will need random values.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We can use a `for` loop that logs a random value with each iteration.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Iteration Random  (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `03-Iteration-Random/README.md`.

```md
# Iteration Random

In this activity, you will use a `for` loop and `Math.random()` to log random numbers in the browser console.

## Instructions

* Open `index.html` in your IDE and add JavaScript code to generate a random number between 1 and 10 and log it in the console.

  * Use a `for` loop to log 10 numbers in the console.

  * Use `Math.random()` to generate a random number.

## Hint(s)

`Math.random()` returns a decimal (or _floating point_) number. How will you convert it to a whole number?
```

### 5. Instructor Review: Iteration Random  (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ `for` loop

  * ✔️ `Math.random()`

  * ✔️ `Math.floor()`

* Open `03-Iteration-Random/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 We first open a `<script>` tag to write our JavaScript code. Then we create a `for` loop and set the value of the condition to `10` so it will loop 10 times.

  ```js
  <script type="text/javascript">
    // Loop 10 times
    for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  ```

  * 🔑 Next, we declare a variable `num` and generate a value between 0 and 10 using `Math.random() * 10`.
  
  * 🔑 We pass that value to `Math.floor()` to round down to a whole number. We then add 1 at the end to ensure we get a number between 1 and 10.

  ```js
  var num = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;
  ```

  * Lastly, we log the `num` in the browser console and close the `<script>` tag.

  ```js
    // Display in console
    console.log(num);
  }
  </script>
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why do we add 1 to the value returned by `Math.floor()`?

  * 🙋 To ensure that the value is between 1 and 10.

  * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to the lessons, read the [MDN Web Docs on Math](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Functions (5 min) 

* Open `04-Functions/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 This demo uses functions to create and return values. 
  
  * 🔑 If we inspect our console, we see that the results of the function calls are logged.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We used functions in lesson 1 when we created the `fight()` function to interact with the browser.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  * 🙋 We will want to write functions to make our code DRY.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We will need to write function declarations or expressions and log the returned values.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Functions (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Functions/README.md`.

```md
# Functions

In this activity, you will write functions to do simple math and check the arguments passed in. Then you will log the results in the browser console.

## Instructions

* Open [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) in your IDE and add JavaScript code for the following:

  * Create a function, `adder()`, that accepts three arguments and returns their sum.

  * Create a function, `muliplier()`, that accepts three arguments and returns their product. 

  * Create a function, `isString()`, that accepts three arguments and checks if the type of all three is a string.

    * If they are strings, return a message confirming they are strings.

    * If they are not strings, return a message saying they are not strings.

  * Create a function, `vowelChecker()`, that accepts one argument, a string, and checks if the first letter of the string is a vowel. 

    * If it is a vowel, return a message confirming it is a vowel.

    * If it is not a vowel, return a message saying it is not a vowel.

* Check the browser console to see if the functions are working correctly and the messages are being logged successfully.

## Hint(s) 

* How do you check the _type of_ a value?

* How do you check the _character at_ a given position in a string?
```

### 8. Instructor Review: Functions (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ Function declarations

  * ✔️ `typeof`

  * ✔️ `toLowerCase()` and `charAt()`

  * ✔️ Assigning function return value to a variable 

* Open `04-Functions/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 Our `adder()` and `multiplier()` functions are very similar. We use the `function` keyword followed by the name of the function. Each function accepts three parameters, `x, y, z`, wrapped in parentheses. Our function block is designated with the curly braces. Within the braces, we use the `return` keyword to return the value of our addition and multiplication operations, respectively. 

  ```js
  function adder(x, y, z) {
    return x + y + z;
  }

  function multiplier(x, y, z) {
    return x * y * z;
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 Our `isString()` function also accepts three parameters. Within the function, we use `typeof` to check if the type of each of the arguments is a string. If all conditions evaluate as true, we return an affirmative statement. If not, we return a negative response. 

  ```js
  function isString(x, y, z) {
    if (
      typeof x === 'string' &&
      typeof y === 'string' &&
      typeof z === 'string'
    ) {
      return 'Yep. They are all strings!';
    }

    else {
      return "No... I don't believe these are strings.";
    }
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 Our `vowelChecker()` function only accepts one parameter. We _chain_ the `toLowerCase()` and the `charAt()` string methods to convert the first character of our argument to lowercase. 
  
  ```js
  function vowelChecker(x) {
    var firstChar = x.toLowerCase().charAt(0);
  ```

  * Using the OR (`||`) operator, we check if any of the conditions are met. Then we return the appropriate messages.

  ```js
  if (
    firstChar === 'a' ||
    firstChar === 'e' ||
    firstChar === 'i' ||
    firstChar === 'o' ||
    firstChar === 'u'
  ) {
    return 'Yes, the first letter is a vowel!';
  } else {
    return 'First letter is NOT a vowel.';
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 Lastly, we call each of our functions, assigning the returned value to variables and logging those values in the browser console. 

  ```js
  var sum = adder(1, 2, 3);

  console.log('The result of adder() is ' + sum);

  var product = multiplier(2, 3, 4);

  console.log('The result of multiplier() is ' + product);

  var stringCheckOne = isString('Jared', 'Bad', 'Monkey');

  console.log(stringCheckOne);

  var stringCheckTwo = isString(2, 'Way', 'Street');

  console.log(stringCheckTwo);

  var vowelCheckOne = vowelChecker('Eek');

  console.log(vowelCheckOne);

  var vowelCheckTwo = vowelChecker('Nah');

  console.log(vowelCheckTwo);
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What is an alternative way to write functions? 

  * 🙋 We could also write function expressions, rather than declarations.

  * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understanding this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [MDN Web Docs on Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Instructor Demo: Rock Paper Scissors (5 min) 

* Open `05-Rock-Paper-Scissors/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game. When we load the webpage, we are prompted to enter one of three characters, `r`, `p`, or `s`.

  * 🔑 After entering a value and clicking OK, we are alerted to the choice of the computer. 

  * 🔑 When we click OK, we are alerted to the number of games we won, lost, or tied. 

  * 🔑 The game concludes after 3 rounds, displaying the total wins, ties, and losses.

  * 🔑 If we enter a character other than `r`, `p`, or `s`, we receive an alert instructing us to choose a correct option.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We have used functions in lesson 1 to interact with the browser.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  * 🙋 This activity brings together several concepts needed to successfully complete the challenge: prompts and alerts, generating random values, selecting elements from an array, iteration and conditional statements. 

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We could start by setting up an array of computer choices and state variables to track wins, losses and ties. Next, we could declare a for loop to encapsulate game logic 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 10. Student Do: Rock Paper Scissors (20 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `05-Rock-Paper-Scissors/README.md`.

```md
# Rock-Paper-Scissors

In this activity, you will use functions to create a simple Rock Paper Scissors game.

## Instructions

* Open [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) in your IDE and create a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game in which one player plays against a computer opponent. 

  * Create an array of the three game choices: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

  * Create variables to hold the number of wins, losses, and ties. They start at 0.

  * Using `Math.floor()` and `Math.random()`, randomly choose one of the three game choices as the computer's turn.

  * Using `prompt()`, collect the user's response and convert it to lower case as the user's turn.

  * Using `if/else` statements, create the game logic to run if the user chooses a valid game option. 

  * Using `alert()`, let the user know the result of each round as well as the final total.

### Rules for Rock-Paper-Scissors

* Rock: wins against scissors, loses to paper, and ties against itself.

* Paper: wins against rock, loses to scissors, and ties against itself.

* Scissors: wins against paper, loses to rock, and ties against itself.
```

### 11. Instructor Review: Rock Paper Scissors (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ Defining state variables

  * ✔️ Randomly selecting array elements

  * ✔️ Updating state variables with conditional statements

* Open `05-Stu_Rock-Paper-Scissors/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * We first create an array of game choices. 

  ```js
  var gameChoices = ['r', 'p', 's'];
  ```

  * 🔑 We then declare _state_ variables to track wins, ties, and losses.

  ```js
  var wins = 0;
  var losses = 0;
  var ties = 0;
  ```

  * We encapsulate our game logic in a `for` loop and set its condition to 3 so that we only play 3 rounds.

  ```js
  for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  ```

  * 🔑 We declare a `computerTurn` variable and set its value to one of the choices stored in the `gameChoices` array. The value is randomly selected using `Math.random()` multiplied by the length of the `gameChoices` array and then rounded down to a whole number between 0 and 2 using `Math.floor()`.

  ```js
  var computerTurn =
    gameChoices[Math.floor(Math.random() * gameChoices.length)];
  ```

  * We then `prompt()` the user for their turn and, just in case their caps lock was on, we convert the value to lower case.

  ```js
  var userTurn = prompt('Enter r, p, or s to play!');
  userTurn = userTurn.toLowerCase();
  ```

  * Using the OR (`||`) operator, we evaluate if the `userTurn` is a valid response. If so, we proceed with game play. 
  
  ```js
  if (userTurn === 'r' || userTurn === 'p' || userTurn === 's') {
    alert('The computer chose ' + computerTurn);
  ```
  
  * We then compare the value of `userTurn` to the value of `computerTurn` and update the `wins`, `ties`, and `losses` state variables accordingly.

  ```js
  // Win/lose conditions:
  if (
    (userTurn === 'r' && computerTurn === 's') ||
    (userTurn === 's' && computerTurn === 'p') ||
    (userTurn === 'p' && computerTurn === 'r')
  ) {
    wins++;
    alert("You've won " + wins + ' time(s)!');
  } else if (userTurn === computerTurn) {
    ties++;
    alert("You've tied " + ties + ' time(s).');
  } else {
    losses++;
    alert("You've lost " + losses + ' time(s).');
  }
  ```

  * If the user did not enter a valid game choice, we alert them

  ```js
  else {
    alert("Please choose 'r', 'p' or 's'!");
  }
  ```

  * Lastly, when the `for` loop exits, we alert the user with the total wins, ties, and losses.

  ```js
  alert(
    'Total wins: ' +
      wins +
      '\nTotal ties: ' +
      ties +
      '\nTotal losses: ' +
      losses
  );
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understanding this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to the lesson plan and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 12. Recap & Promote Additional Resources (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What do you think you absolutely need to know to succeed at the challenge?

  * 🙋 To complete the challenge, we need to know how to get and store user input using prompts and confirms. We also need to know how to generate random numbers, select items from arrays, and implement control flow using functions, iterations and conditional statements.

  * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

  * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it is not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful. 

  * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material prior to class as possible?

  * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

* Direct students to the additional resources available to them:

  * Reflection and Retrieval

  * Career Connection

  * Dessert Menu

### 13. Introduce Upcoming Challenge (5 min)

* Open `01-Class-Content/04-Web-APIs/02-Challenge/Main/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * The upcoming challenge is a "code quiz".

  * When we click 'Start', we are presented with a series of questions and a timer begins counting down. 

  * If we get an answer wrong, 15 seconds are subtracted from the timer.

  * After answering all questions, we are prompted to enter our name in a form. If we close and reopen the browser, we can view the high score by clicking the 'View Highscores' link in the upper left. 

  * 📝 It's not required, but selecting an answer generates sounds for correct and incorrect.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are we learning?

  * 🙋 We are learning how to handle and respond to clicks, dynamically generate HTML, set a timer, and store data in the browser.

  * ☝️ How does this project build off or extend previously learned material?

  * 🙋 We will need to implement the all of our recently acquired programming fundamentals to complete this challenge.

  * ☝️ How does this project relate to your career goals?

  * 🙋 It's a code challenge in two ways: 1) the questions reinforce your understanding of fundamental concepts; 2) the challenge itself demonstrates understanding of how HTML, CSS and JavaScript work together in the browser. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 14. Office Hours (30 min)

* Announce Office Hours and encourage students to stay on the Zoom and start the challenge while they have live support from instructional staff.
