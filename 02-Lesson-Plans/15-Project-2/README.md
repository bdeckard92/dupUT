# Module 15 Instructor Overview: Project 2

## Overview

In this week's virtual classes, you'll review agile project management and Git workflow as needed. Otherwise, you will provide support for the students as they work on Project 2.

## Virtual Classes

* [Virtual Class 15.1](./15.1-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* There is no lesson plan for the second virtual class this week. Use the entirety of class time as office hours to assist students with their projects. In place of lecture and activities, hold stand-up meetings with each group to gauge progress and advise as necessary.

* Students can refer to this [guide](../../01-Class-Content/15-Project-2/04-Supplemental/GitHubHerokuConnect.md) on how to connect a GitHub repository to Heroku for automatic deployment.

## Career Connection

During each lesson that students work through, they will also view a Career Connection section that will tie together the academic content with Career Services and how this material will be applicable to them in their future career.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Director and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careerservicesonlineevents.splashthat.com/).

If you'd like more information on Career Services, visit the [Career Services resources page](https://mycareerspot.org/).
