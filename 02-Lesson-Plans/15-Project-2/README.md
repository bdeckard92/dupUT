# Module 15 Instructor Overview: Project 2

## Overview

In this module, students will begin work on their second project of the Boot Camp--a full-stack application that connects a robust back-end with servers, databases, advanced APIs, and user authentication to an intuitive front end. You will assume the role of "scrummaster" and hold daily scrum meetings with each group.

## Virtual Classes

Here are the lesson plans for this week's virtual classes:

* [15.1 Virtual Class](./15.1-REQUIRED.md)

* [15.2 Virtual Class](./15.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* Prepare a list of project group members prior to the first class for this module. This time, assign three students per group, all around the same skill level. You can add a slide to this module's slide deck to list the group members, or you can send the list out to students via Slack. Let students know that they will be allowed to create their own groups for the final project.

* There are occasional circumstances, such as an illness or a personal emergency, which might force a student to complete a group project on their own. In these circumstances, as the instructor, you will meet with the student and SSM to determine if completing the project independently is the best path forward. If it is, you will share adjusted project requirements and a grading rubric with the student.

* Be sure to spend plenty of time making sure that students follow best practices while collaborating with Git.

* Encourage students to spend time pseudocoding their projects and researching APIs and libraries before writing any code. Remind them that they already have code they can reuse for authentication from the previous module.

## Career Connection

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Coach and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for career services workshops](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp).

## Heads-Up

* In the next module, students will present their group project on the last day of class.

* Students must have a deployed project by presentation day, so encourage students to deploy their projects by the class before presentation day at the latest. Deployed projects can always be updated, so it is recommended that students deploy early on and update their live version with every new feature.

* Prepare a slide deck of superlative awards to give to each group on presentation day. Here is an [example slide deck of superlative awards](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fJGzsclaQ5TKBk3EnL7Gc-bg1ijSGM6_oB1gvpKYnZE/edit?usp=sharing).
