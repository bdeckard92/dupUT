# Module 11  Virtual Class (Recommended): Express and Web Servers

## Overview 

In today's recommended virtual class, students will review setting up an Express application using standard GET routes and GET routes with parameters, as well as solve a new algorithm in CodeSignal.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Solve the CodeSignal algorithm `addOne`

* Create a Node web server using Express

* Create and use Express GET routes with parameters

## Instructor Notes

* In the first lesson of the async material for this week, students are introduced to Express, GET routes, and `req.params` to serve up animal data from a JSON file. 

* They will also be introduced to using query parameters `req.query` in the first lesson as well, so it would be good to remind them the difference between `req.query` and `req.params`

* Make sure students know they have to run `npm install` for every activity and stop the server before running the next one.

## Class Instructions 

### 1. Introduction (5 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Direct students to post individual questions in the Zoom chat to be addressed by TAs and/or at the end of class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

    * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back and see what we accomplished, and acknowledge that it's a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic? 

    * 🙋 Let's do "fist to five" together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 2. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* [Click here for CodeSignal challenge](https://app.codesignal.com/public-test/7wsdGsoYtdM8narY9/j2q8xRbzqXKT8k) 

* This week students will receive an email from the Career Director encouraging them to start their resume, and next week they'll see some content in their online unit that walks them through how to create a technical resume ready for interviewing!

* Remind students that for those who are job-seekers, it's important to complete these Career Services milestones. Once they do, they get access to a lot more resources like dedicated 1:1 time with their Career Director, access to a range of online workshops, and post-bootcamp support!

* In the meantime, ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Did anyone attempt the Code Signal algorithm?

    * 🙋 It is encouraged to take advantage of the CodeSignal practice because it reflects real-world online interviewing.

* Open your IDE and review the solution to the CodeSignal algorithm:

    * Let students know that this was a tough one. When they are solving for these during the week, they should utilize outside resources like Google and Stack Overflow to help them figure out a solution.

    * The algorithm is called `addOne`, which is the same as a common algorithm tested by employers, usually called `plusOne`.

    * In this algorithm challenge, you are given an array of `integers` representing the digits of a positive integer. For example, `digits = [1, 2, 3]` represents the integer 123. It is guaranteed that digits do not have any leading zeros. Assuming that `digits` represents the integer `n`, your task is to return an array that represents the integer `n + 1`.

    * For `digits = [1, 2, 3]`, the output should be `addOne(digits) = [1, 2, 4]`

    * For `digits = [1, 2, 9]`, the output should be `addOne(digits) = [1, 3, 0]`

    * For `digits = [9, 9, 9]`, the output should be `addOne(digits) = [1, 0, 0, 0]`

    * The instructions provide the following details regarding input and output:

    ```md
    [execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)

    [input] array.integer digits

    An array with integer digits from 0 to 9.

    Guaranteed constraints:
    1 ≤ digits.length ≤ 104,
    0 ≤ digits[i] ≤ 9 .

    [output] array.integer

    Return an array that represents the digits of n + 1.
    ```

    * We are also provided the following starter code:

    ```js
    function addOne(digits) {

    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝) and call on students for answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ There are myriad ways to solve for this. One way to tackle the problem is to work backwards in our array of numbers. So how do we set up a loop to iterate through the array from last element to first?

    * 🙋 We would use the same format as a regular `for` loop, but starting at the end, and then decrementing `i`.

    ```js
    for (let i = digits.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {

    }
    ``` 

    * ☝ Exactly! Then what we'll want to do in this `for` loop is increment the element, i.e. if the last element is `3`, we'll increment it to `4` and so on. But we need some additional checks! We want to check if the element is less than 10 and not the left most element. How can we do that?

    * 🙋 We can start off by just incrementing the element with `digits[i]++` and then implementing the following checks in code.

    ```js
    if (digits[i] < 10 && digits[i] !== 0) return digits;
    ```

    * ☝ Right, and if we don't return `digits` here, then we'll know that the element must be greater than 10, so we can decrease to 0. The next iteration will know that the element needs to be incremented. So here we can just use `digits[i] = 0;` Then, if it _is_ the left most element, we need to add one more element to the left to catch the carry:

    ```js
    if (i === 0) {
        digits.unshift(1)
        return digits;
    }
    ```

* Let students know that this was a _really tricky_ algorithm to solve, and it's totally okay if they didn't manage it right now. Encourage them to take the time outside of class to read more about solving for prime numbers.

* Full solution:

```js
function addOne(digits) {
    for (let i = digits.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        digits[i]++;
        if (digits[i] < 10 && digits[i] !== 0) return digits;
        digits[i] = 0;
        if (i === 0) {
            digits.unshift(1)
            return digits;
        }
    }
}
```

* Answer any questions students have before moving to the next activity.

### 3. Instructor Demo: Routes (5 min) 

* Run `01-Stu_Routes/Solved/server.js` from the command line and demonstrate the following: 

    * 🔑 When we visit the root route in the browser `/`, we see a message welcoming us to the Star Wars page.

    * 🔑 When we visit the routes for `/darthmaul` and `/yoda`, we see information for the respective character in JSON format.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used this to retrieve animal data in the first lesson of the module project.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We need to be able to retrieve data from a server when we visit a certain route.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We would create a server using Express with GET routes to serve the data.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 4. Student Do: Routes (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-Stu_Routes/README.md`.

```md
    # Express Routes

    ## Instructions

    * Create a data object for `obiwankenobi`. Give the object `name`, `role`, `age`, and `forcePoints` properties of your choosing. 

    * Create an Express route that listens for calls to the `obiwankenobi` endpoint and returns the data object as JSON.
```


### 5. Instructor Review: Routes (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ `const obiwankenobi = {};`

    * ✔️ `app.get('/obiwankenobi', (req, res) => {})`

* Open `01-Stu_Routes/Solved/server.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 We create an object for Obi Wan Kenobi's data 
    ```js
    const obiwankenobi = {
        name: 'Obi Wan Kenobi',
        role: 'Jedi Master',
        age: 55,
        forcePoints: 1350
    };
    ```

    * 🔑 We create a GET route to serve Obi Wan Kenobi's data as JSON

    ```js
    app.get('/obiwankenobi', (req, res) => {
        res.json(obiwankenobi);
    });
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Why do we use `res.json()` instead of `res.send()`?

    * 🙋 We need to keep the data formatted as an object when it is served to the client (or front end)

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 1, read the [Express documentation on res.json()](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.json), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 6. Instructor Demo: Parameters (5 min) 

* Run `02-Stu_Parameters/Solved/server.js` from the command line and demonstrate the following: 

    * 🔑 When we visit `http://localhost:3000/api/characters`

    * 🔑 We see all of our character data as JSON

    * 🔑 When we visit `http://localhost:3000/api/characters/yoda`, `/api/characters/darthmaul`, or `/api/characters/obiwankenobi`

    * 🔑 We only see one character's data as JSON

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 In the first lesson of the module project when we created routes to serve all animal data or serve just one animal's data by its `id` property.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We want to have the ability to view all of our data but also have the ability to view data one piece at a time.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We would create two routes, one to serve all data and another that accepts a parameter to retrieve filtered data.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 7. Student Do: Parameters (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Stu_Parameters/README.md`.

```md
    # Express Parameters

    ## Instructions

    * Create a route `/api/characters` to return all characters. 

    * Create one more route, and _only_ one more route, to return any given specific character. For example, a call to `api/characters/yoda` will return the data stored in the `yoda` object.


    ## Hint(s)

    * What's the title of this activity? 
```


### 8. Instructor Review:  (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ `app.get('/api/characters/:character')`

    * ✔️ `req.params.character`

    * ✔️ `res.send('No character found');`

* Open `02-Stu_Parameters/Solved/server.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 We set up the route to handle variable content in the URL so we can pass in different character names. This is called a "route parameter".

    ```js
    // i.e. /api/characters/obiwankenobi
    app.get('/api/characters/:character', (req, res) => {});
    ```

    * 🔑 We can figure out which character we are looking for by accessing the route's parameter in the param's object and look for a matching data in our array of characters to send back to the client as JSON.

    ```js
    const chosen = req.params.character;

    for (let i = 0; i < characters.length; i++) {
        if (chosen === characters[i].routeName) {
            return res.json(characters[i]);
        }
    }
    ```

    * If we don't find a character, we send back a message saying so because no matter what, we have to respond to a request.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Why is this a better method than creating a route for every character?

    * 🙋 Since we look up every character in the same way, this DRYs up our code significantly. If we made a route for every character in Star Wars, it wouldn't be maintainable! 

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understanding this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 1, read the [Express guide to route parameters](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html#route-parameters), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 09. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

    * 🙋 We reviewed how to create GET routes using Express and how to use route parameters to find and send filtered data to the client.

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful. 

    * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

    * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer. 

    * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

    * 🙋 Each lesson provides information about a new aspect of web servers and Express. 
        
        * Lesson 1 is all about creating a server with simple GET routes. 
        
        * Lesson 2 is about accepting data through POST routes 
        
        * Lesson 3 is about serving front-end code to create a full-stack application

        * Lesson 4 is about scaling our Express API with Express Router

    * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Use student answers to transition to office hours.


### 10. Office Hours (30 min)

* Announce office hours and invite students to stay on the Zoom and start the challenge while they have live support from instructional staff.
