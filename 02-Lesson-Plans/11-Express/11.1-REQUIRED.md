# 11.1 Virtual Class: Express.js

## Overview

In today's virtual class, you will review setting up an Express.js application using standard GET routes and GET routes with parameters.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Create a Node.js web server using Express.js.

* Create and use Express.js GET routes with parameters.

* Make GET requests to the server using the fetch API.

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo and to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly, ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity, and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* As class begins, remind students that they will need Insomnia for the majority of this unit. Post the link for the [Insomnia download page](https://insomnia.rest/download) in Slack and instruct students to download and install Insomnia if they have not yet done so.

* Each activity will require that students create a new Express.js server. Students might encounter a common error with the code `EADDRINUSE`, due to the port being used. They can easily resolve this by running one of the following commands depending on their operating system:

  * macOS:

    ```bash
    killall node
    ```

  * Windows:

    ```bash
    taskkill /im node.exe
    ```

* In the asynchronous content, students learned about API endpoints in Lesson 1 and GET fetch requests in Lesson 3.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Invite students to post questions in the Zoom chat so TAs and/or the instructor can address them at the end of class.

* Open the lesson [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RrWrrQ084PgeaYl_-N0QRQTIHyvUhwokJ-Aq3X3TwPw/edit?usp=sharing) and walk through the following slides on foundation setting:

  **Big Picture**: This is an opportunity to look at the big picture of where students are in the course. Take a moment to discuss a few real-world examples of why this week's topics are valuable.

  **Boot Camp Pointers**: Review some logistics that will help students stay on track. This is an opportunity to speak to what students might need at this particular point in the course.

  **This Week: Express.js**: Review the key skills students will be learning this week.

  **This Week's Assignment**: Give a quick summary of this week's Challenge assignment and describe how the skills they learn throughout the week will be applied to it.

  **Career Connection**: Reinforce that students will use the skills they learn this week throughout their careers. It's important for them to know the "why" and "how" behind the "what." Give examples of how these skills are used on the job. If you feel comfortable, share examples of how you have used them in your professional career.

    * This week, students will receive an email from their Career Coach encouraging them to start working on their resume, and next week the async content will contain instructions on creating a technical resume that's interview-ready.

    * Remind job-seeking students that it's important to complete these career services milestones. When they do, they get access to additional resources, such as dedicated 1:1 time with their Career Coach, access to a range of online workshops, and post-boot-camp support!

    * Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

      * ☝️ Without intending to ask the obvious, why do we need a resume?

      * 🙋 A resume is the core document of any job search. Job seekers in the web development field also need a portfolio and GitHub profile.

      * ☝️ Who can help you complete your resume?

      * 🙋 A Career Material Advisor can! Once you submit your resume to the career team online, you will be assigned a Career Material Advisor (CMA) who can give you unlimited feedback on your resume, even after you graduate from the boot camp. It's important to take advantage of this resource, because creating a technical resume might be very different from what you're used to.

      * ☝️ What else can a CMA help you out with?

      * 🙋 A CMA can also review LinkedIn profiles, GitHub profiles, and other resources, such as cover letters.

  **How to Succeed This Week**: Remind students that they might experience moments of frustration as they learn complex concepts and tools, and that these times are actually proven opportunities to deepen knowledge. Consider sharing something about your personal learning journey. This helps students recognize that everyone starts somewhere, that being a developer means constantly learning new technologies, and that they are not alone.

  **Today's Agenda**: Outline the concepts that will be covered in today's lesson. Remind students that they can find the relevant activity files in the "Getting Ready for Class" page in their course content.

### 2. Instructor Do: Student Check-In (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

  * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back at what we accomplished and acknowledge that it is a lot. It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed -- as long we don’t give up!

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic?

  * 🙋 Let's do Fist to Five together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 3. Instructor Demo: API Endpoints (5 min)

* In the command line, navigate to `01-API-Endpoints/Solved/` and run `npm start` to demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 When we visit the HTML route in the browser `/`, we see the `index.html` file.

  * 🔑 When we visit the API endpoint for `/api`, we see a JSON object with definitions for web-related topics.

  * 🔑 The browser is sufficient for simple GET requests for information like this. However, in the future we will use an application called Insomnia to make GET requests.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We used this to retrieve animal data in Lesson 1.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

  * 🙋 We need to be able to retrieve data from a server when we visit a certain route.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We would create a server using Express.js with GET routes to serve the data.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: API Endpoints (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-API-Endpoints/README.md`, which are also shown here:

  ```md
  # 🏗️ Create an API Route

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to implement an API route that returns content from a JSON file, using an Express.js server.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It is done when I have imported Express.js into my project.

  * It is done when I have created an `app` variable set to the value of `express()`.

  * It is done when I have created an API endpoint to `/api/` that returns the contents of the `terms.json` file.

  * It is done when GET requests made using the browser to the API endpoint return the content found in `terms.json`.

  ---

  ## 💡 Hints

  Which method can we use on the `res` object that will allow us to send JSON to the client?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What other methods are available on the `res` object?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 5. Instructor Review: API Endpoints (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel differentiating between HTML routes and API endpoints? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use Office Hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `res.json()`

  * ✔️ `res.sendFile()`

  * ✔️ Importing JSON files

* In the command line, navigate to `01-API-Endpoints/Solved/` and run `npm install` and `npm start`.

* Open `/Solved/server.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * First, we require Express.js in the server file.

    ```js
    const express = require('express');
    ```

  * To send back a list of terms from the JSON file, we need to require the JSON file as well.

    ```js
    const termData = require('./terms.json');
    ```

* Open `01-API-Endpoints/Solved/terms.json` in your IDE to demonstrate the following:

  * The JSON file holds an array of objects that contain definitions from Wikipedia for various web development terms. This data will be used by the API.

    ```json
    [
      {
          "term": "SEO",
          "definition": "Search engine optimization is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic rather than direct traffic or paid traffic.",
          "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization"
      },
      {
          "term": "API",
          "definition": "An application programming interface, is a computing interface that defines interactions between multiple software intermediaries. It defines the kinds of calls or requests that can be made, how to make them, the data formats that should be used, the conventions to follow, etc",
          "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API"
      },
      {
          "term": "REST",
          "definition": "Stands for Representational State Transfer. This term is usually used in the context of describing an API where requests are made to a URI and a response is given in the form of HTML, XML, JSON, or some other format",
          "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer"
      }
    ]
    ```

  * The next step in creating an Express.js server is to create `app` and `port` variables for later use.

  * We set the `app` variable to the value of `express()`.

    ```js
    const port = 3001;

    const app = express();
    ```

  * 🔑 The solved version contains a root path that returns a string that asks the user to visit the `/api` path.

    ```js
    app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Visit http://localhost:3001/api'));
    ```

  * The main objective of this activity is to create an `/api` endpoint that returns a list of web-related terms to the client as JSON.

  * First, we set up the `/api` endpoint with the `get()` method.

  * In the callback function, we use `res.json()` to send the content of the JSON file that we required at the top of the file.

    ```js
    app.get('/api', (req, res) => res.json(termData));
    ```

  * Additionally, a sample HTML route has been provided in the starter code. Here, we can see the difference between an API endpoint and an HTML route.

  * Static routes also use the `get()` method, but inside the callback function we use `res.sendFile()` to send the `index.html` to the user.

  * 🔑 The `__dirname` variable is a global variable that points to the directory that the currently executing script resides in.

    ```js
    app.get('/', (req, res) => {
      // `res.sendFile` is Express' way of sending a file
      // `__dirname` is a variable that always returns the directory that your server is running in
      res.sendFile(__dirname + '/index.html');
    });
    ```

  * 🔑 In summary, an API endpoint is a route that returns data to the client. An HTML route is a route that returns a static file to the client.

* Open `http://localhost:/3001/api` in your browser to demonstrate the following:

  * By visiting this endpoint in the browser, we are making a GET request and receiving JSON that contains all web terms in the JSON file.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why is JSON the preferred way to send data to a client when creating web applications?

  * 🙋 JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a common data structure that can be used with many front-end applications and services. It sends and receives data for back-end services, like Express.js APIs.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [Express.js documentation on routing](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html#response-methods), and attend Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: GET Fetch (5 min)

* In the command line, navigate to `02-GET-Fetch/Solved` and run `npm start` to demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 When we visit <http://localhost:3001/> in our browser, we see a page with a "Fetch Pets" button.

  * 🔑 When we click the button, we are making a fetch request to the `/api/pets` endpoint, and the front-end JavaScript code will update the page with pictures of the pets and data from our API.

  * 🔑 We can also use the `/api/pets` endpoint to fetch data from our API and display it as raw JSON.

  * This is an example of how we can use an Express.js server, along with front end JavaScript, to fetch and display data from our own API.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What is the difference between a GET and a POST request?

  * 🙋 A GET request is used to retrieve data from a server. A POST request is used to send data to a server.

  * ☝️ How do we make a GET request in our browser?

  * 🙋 We can use the `fetch()` method to make a GET request.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: GET Fetch (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-GET-Fetch/README.md`, which are also shown here:

  ```md
  # 🐛 Client/Server Requests Not Working

  Work with a partner to resolve the following issues:

  * As a user, I want to be able to view pet data on the page by pressing a "Fetch Pets" button.

  ## Expected Behavior

  When the user clicks the "Fetch Pets" button from the front end, each pet is rendered in a card on the screen.

  ## Actual Behavior

  When a user requests the terms by clicking "Fetch Pets", nothing is rendered to the page and an error appears in the developer console.

  ## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

  To reproduce the problem, follow these steps:

  1. Open the page by visiting [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

  2. Open the developer console by pressing Command+Option+K (macOS) or Ctrl+Shift+J (Windows).

  3. Click "Fetch Pets", and note the lack of results on the page and the error in the developer console.

  ---

  ## 💡 Hints

  How can we test the endpoints outside of the browser?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What are static assets?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 8. Instructor Review: GET Fetch  (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with debugging client requests? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use Office Hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ Fetch API

  * ✔️ HTTP methods

* In the command line, navigate to `02-GET-Fetch/public/index.js` and run `npm install` and `npm start`.

* Open `http://localhost:3001` in your browser to demonstrate the following:

  * When we run this application and visit `http://localhost:3001`, we notice that there is a button that doesn't seem to do anything.

  * After we open the developer console, we encounter an error that tells us there was a problem parsing the JSON data.

    ```console
    Uncaught (in promise) SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character at line 1 column 1 of the JSON data
    ```

  * In the developer window, navigate to the Network tab and click the "Fetch Pets" button again.

  * Note that a network request is being made from the front end and results in a 404 error, which means that the requested resource wasn't found.

  * We know that the client is attempting a request of some sort, so we can start troubleshooting this issue in the front-end JavaScript.

* Return to `02-GET-Fetch/Unsolved/public/index.js` in your IDE to demonstrate the following:

  * In `index.js`, we have a helper function called `getPets()` that makes a request to `/api/pets`.

      ```js
      const getPets = () =>
        fetch('/api/pets', {
          method: 'POST',
          body: '',
        })
          .then((res) => res.json())
          .then((data) => data);
      ```

  * Additionally, the application is meant to get data instead of saving data to the server. As a result, a POST request doesn't make sense here.

  * Let's see what happens when we change `POST` to `GET`. Save the code, refresh the page, and try again.

* Open `http://localhost:3001` in your browser to demonstrate the following:

  * After refreshing the page and clicking "Fetch Pets", we encounter a different error, which isn't always a bad thing. This error tells us that GET requests shouldn't have a `body` property. Let's fix that.

* Open `02-GET-Fetch/Unsolved/public/index.js` in your IDE to demonstrate the following:

  * Remove the `body` attribute of the `fetch()` request, and save the file.

  * Your code should now look something like the following example.

    ```js
    const getPets = () =>
      fetch('/api/pets', {
        method: 'GET',
        // body: '',
      })
        .then((res) => res.json())
        .then((data) => data);
    ```

  * After making these changes, we can test the application again.

* Open `http://localhost:3001` in your browser to demonstrate the following:

  * After we refresh the page and click "Fetch Pets", the application seems to work as intended!

  * You should see a list of pets, with a description and an image for each pet.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How do we retrieve data from the API using client-side JavaScript?

  * 🙋 We use the Fetch API and provide the corresponding HTTP method in the `options` object.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on using Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch), and attend Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Everyone Do: Git (30 min)

* Open the [Git documentation on git log](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-log) in your browser and explain the following:

  * The command `git log` provides a list of commits that have been made to a given repository. You can use it to query specific folders, authors, date ranges, and keywords in order to get specific information about the history of your repository.

* In this Git Guide, we explore the history of an open source project in order to learn how to use some lesser-known Git commands.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `Git-Guide/README.md`.

* While everyone is working on the activity, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

* Open your command line and demonstrate the following:

  * When we run `git log`, we get an output to the command line that contains a list of previous commits. We can filter this information further to get exactly what we are looking for.

  * In preparation for the activity, visit the [GitHub repository for Inquirer.js](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js) and clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:SBoudrias/Inquirer.js.git
    cd Inquirer.js
    ```

  * 🔑 This Git Guide also covers some additional commands, including `git blame`. For more information, refer to the [Git documentation on git blame](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-blame).

* Answer any questions before proceeding.

### 10. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

  * 🙋 We reviewed how to create GET routes using Express.js and how to use route parameters to find and send filtered data to the client.

  * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

  * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful.

  * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

  * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the Challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

  * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

  * 🙋 Lesson 1 is all about creating a server using simple GET routes.

  * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Answer any questions before ending the class.
