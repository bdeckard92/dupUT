# Module 11 Virtual Class: Express.js

## Overview 

In today's virtual class, students will review setting up an Express.js application using standard GET routes and GET routes with parameters.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Create a Node.js web server using Express.js

* Create and use Express.js GET routes with parameters

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* In Lesson 1, students were introduced to Express.js, GET routes, and `req.params` to serve up animal data from a JSON file. 

* They were also introduced to using query parameters `req.query` in Lesson 1, so it would be good to remind them of the difference between `req.query` and `req.params`.

* Make sure students know that they have to run `npm install` for every activity and stop the server before running the next one.

## Class Instructions 

### 1. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Invite students to post questions in the Zoom chat so TAs and/or the instructor can address them at the end of class.

* Open the lesson [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RrWrrQ084PgeaYl_-N0QRQTIHyvUhwokJ-Aq3X3TwPw/edit?usp=sharing) and walk through the following slides on foundation setting: 

  **Big Picture**: This is an opportunity to look at the big picture of where students are in the course. Take a moment to discuss a few real-world examples of why this week's topics are valuable.

  **Boot Camp Pointers**: Review some logistics that will help students stay on track. This is an opportunity to speak to what students might need at this particular point in the course. 

  **This Week**: Review the key skills students will be learning this week. 

  **This Week's Assignment**: Give a quick summary of this week's Challenge assignment and describe how the skills they learn throughout the week will be applied to it.

  **Career Connection**: Reinforce that students will use the skills they learn this week throughout their careers. It's important for them to know the "why" and "how" behind the "what." Give examples of how these skills are used on the job. If you feel comfortable, share examples of how you have used them in your professional career.

    * This week, students will receive an email from their Career Director encouraging them to start working on their resume, and next week the async content will contain instructions on creating a technical resume that's interview-ready.

    * Remind job-seeking students that it's important to complete these Career Services milestones. When they do, they get access to additional resources, such as dedicated 1:1 time with their Career Director, access to a range of online workshops, and post-boot-camp support!

    * Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

      * ☝️ Without intending to ask the obvious, why do we need a resume?

      * 🙋 A resume is the core document of any job search. Job seekers in the web development field also need a portfolio and GitHub profile.

      * ☝️ Who can help you complete your resume?

      * 🙋 A Career Material Advisor can! Once you submit your resume to Career Services online, you will be assigned a Career Material Advisor (CMA) who can give you unlimited feedback on your resume, even after you graduate from the boot camp. It's important to take advantage of this resource, because creating a technical resume might be very different from what you're might be used to.

      * ☝️ What else can a CMA help you out with?

      * 🙋  A CMA can also review LinkedIn profiles, GitHub profiles, and other resources such as cover letters.

  **How to Succeed This Week**: Remind students that they might experience moments of frustration as they learn complex concepts and tools, and that these times are actually proven opportunities to deepen knowledge. Consider sharing something about your personal learning journey. This helps students recognize that everyone starts somewhere, that being a developer means constantly learning new technologies, and that they are not alone.

  **Today's Objectives**: Outline the concepts that will be covered in today's lesson. Remind students that they can find the relevant activity files in the "Getting Ready for Class" page in their course content.

### 2. Instructor Do: Student Check-In (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

  * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back at what we accomplished and acknowledge that it is a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed&mdash;as long as you don’t give up.

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic?

  * 🙋 Let's do Fist to Five together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 3. Instructor Demo: Routes (5 min) 

* Navigate to `01-Routes/Solved/` in the command line and run `npm start` to demonstrate the following: 

    * 🔑 When we visit the root route in the browser `/`, we see a message welcoming us to the Star Wars page.

    * 🔑 When we visit the routes for `/darthmaul` and `/yoda`, we see information for the respective character in JSON format.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used this to retrieve animal data in Lesson 1.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

    * 🙋 We need to be able to retrieve data from a server when we visit a certain route.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We would create a server using Express.js with GET routes to serve the data.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Routes (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-Routes/README.md`, which are also shown here:

  ```md
   # Express Routes

   In this activity, you will create Express routes.

   ## Instructions

   * Navigate to the [Unsolved](Unsolved/) folder and run `npm install`

   * Open the [server.js](Unsolved/server.js) file.

   * Create a data object for `obiwankenobi`.

     * Give the object `name`, `role`, `age`, and `forcePoints` properties of your choosing. 

   * Create an Express route that listens for calls to the `obiwankenobi` endpoint and returns the data object as JSON.
   ```

### 5. Instructor Review: Routes (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points (:key:) below to review the following key points (✔️):

    * ✔️ `obiwankenobi` object

    * ✔️ GET route for `/obiwankenobi`

* Open `01-Routes/Solved/server.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 First, we create a data object for Obi Wan Kenobi. You can enter any values as long as you have a `name`, `role`, `age`, and `forcePoints` properties.

       ```js
       const obiwankenobi = {
         name: 'Obi Wan Kenobi',
         role: 'Jedi Master',
         age: 55,
         forcePoints: 1350
       };
       ```

    * 🔑 Then, we create a GET route to serve Obi Wan Kenobi's data as JSON.

       ```js
       app.get('/obiwankenobi', (req, res) => {
         res.json(obiwankenobi);
       });
       ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Why do we use `res.json()` instead of `res.send()`?

    * 🙋 We need to keep the data formatted as an object when it is served to the client (front end).

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 1, read the [Express documentation on res.json()](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.json), and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Parameters (5 min) 

* Navigate to `02-Parameters/Solved/` in your command line and run `npm start` to demonstrate the following: 

    * 🔑 In our browser, when we visit <http://localhost:3001/api/characters>, we see all of our character data as JSON.

    * 🔑 When we visit <http://localhost:3001/api/characters/yoda>, <http://localhost:3001/api/characters/darthmaul>, or <http://localhost:3001/api/characters/obiwankenobi>, we only see one character's data as JSON.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used this in Lesson 1 when we created routes to serve all animal data or serve just one animal's data by its `id` property.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We want to be able to view all of our data but also be able to view it one piece at a time.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We would create two routes, one to serve all data and another that accepts a parameter to retrieve filtered data.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Parameters (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Parameters/README.md`, which are also shown here:

   ```md
   # Express Parameters

   In this activity, you will create a GET route that returns all of the characters, as well as a GET route that returns one specific character.

   ## Instructions

   * Navigate to your [Unsolved](Unsolved/) folder and run `npm install`.

   * Open the [server.js](Unsolved/server.js) file.

   * Create a GET route `/api/characters` to return all characters. 

   * Create _only_ one more GET route to return any given specific character. 

     * For example, a call to `api/characters/yoda` will return the data stored in the `yoda` object.

     * Iterate through the characters' `routeName` to check if it matches `req.params.character`

     * If there is no such character, send back a message "No character found". 

   ## Hint(s)

   * What's the title of this activity? 

   * You may need to consult the [Express guide to route parameters](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html#route-parameters)
   ```

### 8. Instructor Review: Parameters  (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points (:key:) below to review the following key points (✔️):

    * ✔️ `api/characters` route

    * ✔️ `api/characters/:character` route

    * ✔️ `req.params.character`

    * ✔️ `res.send('No character found')`

* Open `02-Parameters/Solved/server.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 First, we create a GET route that returns all of the characters.

       ```js
       app.get('/api/characters', (req, res) => {
         return res.json(characters);
       });
       ```
    
    * 🔑 Then, we create another GET route to handle variable content in the URL so we can pass in different character names. This is called a "route parameter".

       ```js
       app.get('/api/characters/:character', (req, res) => {})
       ```

    * 🔑 We can figure out which character we are looking for by accessing the route's parameter in the parameter's object and look for a matching data in our array of characters to send back to the client as JSON.

       ```js
       const chosen = req.params.character;

       for (let i = 0; i < characters.length; i++) {
         if (chosen === characters[i].routeName) {
         return res.json(characters[i]);
         }
       }
       ```

    * 🔑 If we don't find a character, we send back a message saying "No character found" because no matter what, we have to respond to a request.

       ```js
       return res.send('No character found');
       ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Why is this a better method than creating a route for every character?

    * 🙋 Since we look up every character in the same way, this DRYs up our code significantly. If we made a route for every character in Star Wars, it wouldn't be maintainable. 

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 1, read the [Express guide to route parameters](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html#route-parameters), and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

    * 🙋 We reviewed how to create GET routes using Express and how to use route parameters to find and send filtered data to the client.

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful. 

    * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

    * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the Challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer. 

    * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

    * 🙋 Lesson 1 is all about creating a server using simple GET routes. 

    * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Use student answers to transition to Office Hours.

### 10. Office Hours (30 min)

* Announce Office Hours, and invite students to stay on the Zoom and start the Challenge while they have live support from instructional staff.
