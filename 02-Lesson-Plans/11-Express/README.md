# Module 11 Instructor Overview: Express.js

## Overview

In this week's module, students learn how to create their own server-side APIs using the Express.js framework. As the most widely used Node.js server framework, Express will allow students to quickly and easily establish API routes and associated HTTP request methods.

In this week's virtual classes, you'll review setting up an Express application using standard GET routes and GET routes with parameters, as well as review Express server basics.

## Overview of Asynchronous Material

Why are students learning Express.js?

* Express.js is the most widely used Node.js server framework.
* Express.js allows students to quickly create routes for static assets and API endpoints.
* Express.js allows students to respond to requests using different `HTTP` methods and response codes.
* Modular routes using with Express.js reinforce the concept of separation of concerns, an important skill in for object oriented programming.
* Express.js allows students to fully realize how client side requests relate to server side responses.

Throughout the async module this week, students will use Express.js to do the following:

* Serve static HTML files.
* Create an API to handle `GET` and `POST` requests.
* Parse parameters in server-side routes.
* Submit form data to a server.
* Implement separation of concerns for routing.
* Deploy a server-side application to the Heroku platform.

**Reminder:** If students need help with an async activity, encourage them to attend Office Hours for help! If you can’t get through all of it, remind them that they can lean on Learning Assistants with the AskBCS bot for more help.

## Virtual Classes

If your class started AFTER January 1, 2021, use these lesson plans:

* [Virtual Class 11.1](./11.1-REQUIRED.md)

* [Virtual Class 11.2](./11.2-REQUIRED.md)

If your class started BEFORE January 1, 2021, use these lesson plans:

## Career Connection

During each lesson that students work through, they will also view a Career Connection section that will tie together the academic content with Career Services and how this material will be applicable to them in their future career.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Director and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careerservicesonlineevents.splashthat.com/).

If you'd like more information on Career Services, visit the [Career Services resources page](https://mycareerspot.org/).
