# Module 11 Virtual Class: Express.js

## Overview

In today's virtual class, students will review Express server basics. Students will use `app.post()` to handle POST requests and also build a "Product Reviews" application that will serve both API routes and HTML routes, similar to their challenge. Additionally, students will use practice implementing data persistence into their backend application.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Configure an Express.js app to handle POST requests.

* Implement Express.js middleware to be able to read data from a POST request.

* Implement client-side POST requests to submit form data to a server.

* Read and write to a JSON file.

## Instructor Notes

* At the beginning of class, post the link to the [Insomnia download page](https://insomnia.rest/download) in Slack. Instruct students to download and install Insomnia if they have not yet done so.

* Each activity will require spinning up a new Express.js server. Students might encounter a common error with the code `EADDRINUSE`, due to the port being used. They can easily fix this error by running one of the following commands based on their operating system:

  * Mac:

    ```bash
    killall node
    ```

  * Windows:

    ```bash
    taskkill /im node.exe
    ```

* Today's activities also cover persistent storage. Module 12 covers databases, so for now we will store data using the Node.js `fs` module and JSON files. To accomplish this, some activities include helper functions in a `/helpers` directory.

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to further their knowledge.

## Office Hours

Encourage students to work on the remaining module algorithms during office hours. Review the algorithm solutions 5–10 minutes before class begins or during office hours after class.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What did we learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

  * 🙋 We learned how to use Express to set up servers that listen for requests from a client. Clients can be mobile devices, desktop computers, laptops, and even smart fridges! We are moving fast compared to traditional learners. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

  * ☝️ Did anyone have an "Aha!" or "Eureka!" moment this week? When was it and why did things suddenly click for you?

  * 🙋 Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we are thinking about the problem.

  * ☝️ Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

  * 🙋 It's easy to get stuck when you're learning web development. It's important to learn how get unstuck because it happens to the pros, too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups are a great because explaining your problems to someone else often reveals their solution.

### 2. Review Current Challenge (5 min)

* Open `02-Challenge/Main/index.html` in your browser and explain the following:

  * This weeks challenge is a "Note Taker". It allows us to add new notes and save them to a JSON file. It also persists the data so that any time we would like to view our notes, they'll still be there, even if we had to restart the server.

  * 🔑 On the main page, we can choose to add a new note, or view existing notes.

  * 🔑 If we click on an existing note, the create note section is changed to show a detailed view of the note we clicked on.

  * 🔑 We also have the option to delete the note, removing it from the JSON file that stores it.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What recently acquired skills will help us build this challenge?

  * 🙋 We can use Express to serve the list of animals or zookeepers.

  * ☝️ How are these skills relevant to a career in web development?

  * 🙋 APIs are a necessary piece of many web applications.

  * ☝️ How will this challenge improve your portfolio?

  * 🙋 This challenge will demonstrate knowledge of Express and Node, demonstrating that we create back ends for our clients to interact with.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 3. Instructor Demo: POST Requests (5 min)

* Navigate to `03-POST-Requests/server.js` in your command line and run `npm install` and `npm start`.

* Open Insomnia, create a new POST request to `http://localhost:3001/api/reviews`, and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 This demo shows how we can set up POST routes for the Express.js server. To begin, let's open Insomnia and create a new POST request to the endpoint `http://localhost:3001/api/reviews`.

  * 🔑 After making a request to the endpoint, we receive a simple response that the request was received.

  * 🔑 A few console logs will also provide us with additional information about the client in the terminal.

  * 🔑 The `req` object is also being used to dynamically slot in the method attribute that is provided by Express.js.

    ```js
    console.info(req.rawHeaders);

    console.info(`${req.method} request received`);
    ```

  * 🔑 Remember when creating POST routes that requests will also need to be concluded -- preventing the client requests from timing out and letting them know that the server is done processing their request:

    ```js
    res.json(`${req.method} request received`);
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We can start by creating a POST route in the Express.js server using the `app.post()` method, then we use the `req` object to get additional information about the request and client.

### 4. Student Do: POST Requests (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `03-POST-Requests/README.md`.

    ```md
    # 📖 Implement Logging for GET and POST Requests

    Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

    * As a developer, I want to ensure that my requests are handled based on their HTTP method so that future create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations work as intended.

    ## Acceptance Criteria

    * It's done when I have created a route that logs when a user has made a GET request.

    * It's done when I have created a route that logs when a user has made a POST request.

    * It's done when, if I test my route using Insomnia, GET and POST requests are logged.

### 5. Instructor Review: POST Requests (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel creating POST requests? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ GET vs. POST

  * ✔️ One endpoint for two kinds of requests

* Open `03-POST-Requests/server.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * When we open the `server.js` file, we first import Express.js and set a variable for the port:

    ```js
    const express = require('express');
    const port = 3001;
    ```

  * We also have an `app` variable that is set to the value of the `express()` function:

    ```js
    const app = express();
    ```

  * The routes for both `/api/reviews` and `/api/upvotes` have already been started, so let's finish them.

  * 🔑 In the `/api/reviews` route handler, the first thing we want to do is tell the client that we received their request. We do this by invoking `res.json()` and passing in a message:

    ```js
    res.json(`${req.method} request received to get reviews`);
    ```

  * 🔑 Invoking the `res.json()` method will conclude the request-response cycle, but as far as the server is concerned, we can still run the rest of the code in the code block.

  * We use the `console.info()` method to print a message to the console that a request was received. We construct the output string using the `req.method()` object and string interpolation:

    ```js
    console.info(`${req.method} request received to get reviews`);
    ```

  * While this logic is fresh in your mind, you can finish the `/api/upvotes` GET route:

    ```js
    app.get('/api/upvotes', (req, res) => {
      res.json(`${req.method} request received to retrieve upvote count`);

      console.info(`${req.method} request received to retrieve upvote count`);
    });
    ```

  * Next, we create POST routes for both of these endpoints. Using Express.js, it is possible to create two entirely different routes with the same endpoint.

  * The POST route for `/reviews` and `/upvotes` are functionally identical to the GET routes, except that we use `app.post()` instead of `app.get()`:

    ```js
    app.post('/api/reviews', (req, res) => {
      res.json(`${req.method} request received to add a review`);

      console.info(`${req.method} request received to add a review`);
    });
    ```

  * The POST route for `api/upvotes` looks nearly identical, because the goal is to log the request and the HTTP method:

    ```js
    app.post('/api/upvotes', (req, res) => {
      res.json(`${req.method} request received to upvote`);

      console.info(`${req.method} request received to upvote`);
    });
    ```

  * 🔑 If you want to, when creating routes in Express.js, you can perform some logic to update a resource inside of a GET route handler. The different methods on the `app` object are designed to aid organization and readability rather than dictate exactly how APIs should be implemented. However, for the API to be considered RESTful, we should keep the POST logic to POST routes and GET logic to GET routes.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Which HTTP methods can we handle using Express.js?

  * 🙋 Express.js has methods for GET, POST, patch, PUT, DELETE, connect, options, and trace.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [Express.js documentation on basic routing](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/basic-routing.html), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Serving Static Files (5 min)

* Navigate to `04-Static/Solved/` in your command line and run `node server.js`.

* Open <http://localhost:3001/> in your browser and explain the following:

  * Navigating to a route on `localhost` displays an HTML page instead of JSON data.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We used this to serve all of the HTML routes for the zookeeper and animals pages.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  * 🙋 We will use this to serve all of the HTML routes for the zookeeper and animals pages.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We will create a GET route that sends back an HTML file instead of JSON.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Serving Static Files (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Static/README.md`.

```md
# Serving Static Files

In this activity, you will update the home route to return `index.html` when a request is made at `/`.

## Instructions

* Navigate to your [Unsolved](Unsolved/) folder and run `npm install`

* Open the [Unsolved/server.js](Unsolved/server.js) file.

* Import the `path` module

* Update the home route `/`.

  * Use `res.sendFile()` and `path.join()` to return `index.html`

* To check if the home route was updated correctly, navigate to <http://localhost:3001/> in your browser.
```

### 8. Instructor Review: Serving Static Files (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ `res.sendFile()`

  * ✔️ `path.join()`

* Navigate to `04-Static/Solved` from the command line and run `node server.js`.

* Open <http://localhost:3001/> in the browser and point out the following:

  * The page served to us on the `/` route matches the HTML in `index.html`

* Open `04-Static/Solved/server.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * In our dependencies, we need to include the `path` module in order to use `path.join()`.

    ```js
    const path = require('path');
    ```

  * 🔑 `res.sendFile()` allows us to send back a static file to the client, rather than JSON or a plaintext response. In order to use `sendFile()`, we need to provide the absolute path to the HTML file.

  * 🔑 We can do this by combining the full path of the directory that we're in with the relative path to the file we want to send using `path.join()`.

    ```js
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'index.html'));
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why can't we just use `./` instead of `__dirname`?

  * 🙋 `./` refers to the current working directory, which is the directory that `node` is run from. It is important to keep in mind that the `node` can be run from anywhere. We can't guarantee that the user of our application will run `node server.js`, and not `node someParentPath/server.js`.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understanding this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 3, read the [Express.js docs](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Instructor Demo: POST Client (5 min)

* Navigate to `05-POST-Client/Solved` in your command line and run `node server.js`.

* Open <http://localhost:3001/add> in the browser and point out the following:

  * 🔑 The HTML that is served back to us is different from the `index.html`. This one has form elements.

* Open the Network tab in your browser's Developer Tools and point out the following:

  * 🔑 If we fill out the various form fields and hit submit, we can see a POST request is made to our server.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We used this to add animals and zookeepers to the Zoo Keepr application in Lesson 3.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  * 🙋 We will need to be able to hook up a front-end to a back-end, and allow POST requests to be made.

  * ☝️ How would we build the back-end part of this?

  * 🙋 We would start by creating a POST route that allows us to accept new characters. Then we would want our characters array to change so that it includes the new character as well.

  * ☝️ How would we build the front-end part of this?
  
  * 🙋 We would change the front-end by scaffolding our HTML, then pseudocode our script functionality to listen for form submission, get the value in the form field, and finally making a POST request to our server.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 10. Student Do: POST Client (20 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `05-POST-Client/README.md`.

```md
# POST Client

In this activity, you will add a route to return `add.html` when a request is made at `/add`.

## Instructions

* Open the [Unsolved/server.js](Unsolved/server.js) file.

  * Create an `/add` route that returns `add.html`. 

* Open the [Unsolved/add.html](Unsolved/add.html) file.

  * Examine the jQuery at the bottom of the file and take turns explaining what the code is doing.
  
## Bonus 

* Use Regular Expressions (RegEx), like the following code snippet, to create route names without spaces in the POST route.

  `.replace(/\s+/g, "")`

* You can read more about RegEx Patterns later https://www.regexbuddy.com/regex.html
```

### 11. Instructor Review: POST Client (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ Serve multiple HTML pages

  * ✔️ `$.post()`

* Open `05-POST-Client/Solved/server.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We can serve other pages on different routes, just by changing the first argument of `app.get()`. So in the case of our `/add` route, we change the `app.get('/')` to `app.get('/add')`.

  * Then we use `res.sendFile()` and `path.join()` to serve `add.html`:

    ```js
    app.get('/add', (req, res) => {
      res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'add.html'));
    });
    ```

  * If you attempted the bonus question, here is how you would used RegEx to remove the spaces from `newCharacter`.

    ```js
    newCharacter.routeName = newCharacter.name.replace(/\s+/g, '').toLowerCase();
    ```

* Open `/05-POST-Client/Solved/add.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * ☝️ Can anyone share their explanation on what the jQuery is doing?

  * We set up an event listener for the click event on our `add` button.

  * We also use either jQuery or VanillaJS to select the various form fields and extract their values.

    ```js
    $("#add-btn").on("click", function (event) {
        event.preventDefault();
        const newCharacter = {
            name: $("#name").val().trim(),
            role: $("#role").val().trim(),
            age: $("#age").val().trim(),
            forcePoints: $("#force-points").val().trim()
        };
    ```
  * 🔑 Inside the event listener callback, we make a POST request using `$.post` and our new character object.

  * Then, once the server responds to us, we will `console.log` the new character and `alert()` the user.

    ```js
    $.post("/api/characters", newCharacter)
        .then(function (data) {
            console.log("add.html", data);
            alert("Adding character...");
        });
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What is `req.body` used for?

  * 🙋 `req.body` is whatever is sent in a POST request. We can use the contents of `req.body` to create new items.

  * ☝️ What does `$.post()` do?

  * 🙋 `$.post()` allows us to post data to our sever, then do something after the server returns a response.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understanding this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 3, read [POST Express.js documentation](https://expressjs.com/en/5x/api.html#app.post.method) and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 12. Recap & Promote Additional Resources (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What do you think you absolutely need to know to succeed at the challenge?

  * 🙋 To succeed at the challenge, we need to know how to build routes using Express. We also need to know how to do the following with Express: Accept POST requests, GET requests, serve back data. Lastly, we need to be able to send back HTML to the browser.

  * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

  * 🙋 All of it! Remember that we are learning about a large framework that has many methods and techniques. It's going to take a little bit of time before you start to feel comfortable creating servers from scratch.

  * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material as possible?

  * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

  * ☝️ **ONE MORE THING** before we dismiss! In the next module on SQL, you'll be using MySQL, so you will need to install both MySQL server and the MySQL Shell before you begin Module 12. For detailed instructions on how to install them, read the `Up and Running` in Module 12.

* Direct students to the additional resources available to them:

  * Reflection and Retrieval

  * Career Connection

  * Dessert Menu

### 13. Introduce Upcoming Challenge (5 min)

* Navigate to `01-Class-Content/12-SQL/02-Challenge/Main/` in your command line and run `npm start` to demonstrate the following:

  * When we select "View All Employees," we see the contents of the `employees` table combined with data from other tables.

  * When we select "Add Employee," we can input different data points to insert a new record in the table.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are we learning?

  * 🙋 We are learning SQL statements like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, and `JOIN` and SQL-related npm packages.

  * ☝️ How does this project build off or extend previously learned material?

  * 🙋 We will use `inquirer` to get user's input and continue to use ES6 classes and syntax.

  * ☝️ How does this project relate to your career goals?

  * 🙋 Most businesses will require using a database for their applications, so understanding SQL will be a huge asset.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.
