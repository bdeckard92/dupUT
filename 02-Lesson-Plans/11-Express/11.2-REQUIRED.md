# Module 11 Virtual Class (Required): Express and Web Servers

## Overview 

In today's required virtual class, students will review Express server basics. Students will use `app.post` to handle POST requests and also build a "Star Wars API" application that will serve both API routes and HTML routes, similar to their challenge. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Create a route that handles POST requests 

* Explain the purpose of `app.use(express.urlencoded())` middleware

* Explain the purpose of `app.use(express.json())` middleware

* Create a route that sends HTML to the client

## Instructor Notes 

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* Ensure that you are using the correct version of Express (v4).

* Be sure to have Insomnia installed on your machine and you are familiar with using it. 

* Students will find `app.use()` challenging. Review the `03-POST-requests` activity prior to class and be prepared to discuss both middlewares.

* In the async material, POST requests are taught in Lesson 2 and 3, along with serving static files in Lesson 3.

* Make sure students know they have to run `npm install` and stop the server before running the next one.

* At the end of today's class, let the students know that in the next module, Module 12 SQL, students will be using SQLite in their async lessons but MySQL in these sync sessions.

## Office Hours

Encourage students to work on the remaining module algorithms during office hours. Review the algorithm solutions 5–10 minutes before class begins or during office hours after class.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What did we learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

    * 🙋 We learned how to use Express to set up servers that listen for requests from a client. Clients can be mobile devices, desktop computers, laptops, and even smart fridges! We are moving fast compared to traditional learners. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ Did anyone have an "Aha!" or "Eureka!" moment this week? When was it and why did things suddenly click for you? 

    * 🙋 Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we are thinking about the problem.

    * ☝️ Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

    * 🙋 It's easy to get stuck when you're learning web development. It's important to learn how get unstuck because it happens to the pros, too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups are a great because explaining your problems to someone else often reveals their solution. 


### 2. Review Current Challenge (5 min)

* Open `02-Challenge/Master/index.html` in your browser and explain the following:

    * This weeks challenge is a "Note Taker". It allows us to add new notes and save them to a JSON file. It also persists the data so that any time we would like to view our notes, they'll still be there, even if we had to restart the server.

    * 🔑 On the main page, we can choose to add a new note, or view existing notes.

    * 🔑 If we click on an existing note, the create note section is changed to show a detailed view of the note we clicked on. 

    * 🔑 We also have the option to delete the note, removing it from the JSON file that stores it. 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What recently acquired skills will help us build this challenge?

    * 🙋 We can use Express to serve the list of animals or zookeepers.

    * ☝️ How are these skills relevant to a career in web development?

    * 🙋 APIs are a necessary piece of many web applications. 

    * ☝️ How will this challenge improve your portfolio?

    * 🙋 This challenge will demonstrate knowledge of Express and Node, demonstrating that we create back ends for our clients to interact with.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 3. Instructor Demo: POST Requests (5 min) 

* Open Insomnia and demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 Insomnia allows us to choose the type of request we'd like to make. Navigate to the URL bar, click the dropdown menu that says `GET`, and change it to `POST`.

    * 🔑 Add the API endpoint route `localhost:3000/api/characters` and select `JSON` as the body type.

    * 🔑 Enter a new character's details:

    ```js
    {
        "routeName": "lukeskywalker",
        "name": "Luke Skywalker",
        "role": "Jedi",
        "age": "19",
        "forcePoints": "1350"
    }
    ```

    * 🔑 To send a request to the server, click on "Send" and wait for a response. If this doesn't work, we should look in the server's console to see if there are any errors.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Why can't we do this from the browser?

    * 🙋 The browser automatically makes a GET request to whichever route is typed into the URL bar. Therefore, we need to use Insomnia to test out POST requests.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 It provides practice in creating POST routes. 

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We know that it will look similar to the GET routes, but this time we need to be able to handle the data being sent over. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: POST Requests (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `03-POST-Requests/README.md`.

```md
# POST Requests

In this activity, you will create a POST route that adds new characters.

## Instructions

* Open the [Unsolved/server.js](Unsolved/server.js) file.

* Create a POST route to `/api/characters` that adds new characters to the `characters` array. 

  * Log the new character in the console

  * Push the new character into the `characters` array

  * Send a response to the client in JSON format

* To check if a new character can be added correctly, use the Insomnia application to send a POST request to the server with a new character's data.  
```

### 5. Instructor Review: POST Requests (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ middleware

    * ✔️ POST route to `/api/characters`

    * ✔️ Insomnia

* Open `03-POST-Requests/Solved/server.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

    * 🔑 We start by adding middleware so that Express can handle data parsing. 

    * The `express.urlencoded({ extended:true })` allows our app to parse nested objects from the body.

    ```js
     // Sets up the Express app to handle data parsing
    app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
    app.use(express.json());
    ```

    * 🔑 Next, we create a POST route to `/api/characters`. The only difference between declaring a `GET` route and `POST` route is the method name.

    ```js
    // Create a POST route that adds new characters
    app.post('/api/characters', (req, res) => {
    ```

    * We set a variable to `req.body`, the body of data that is passed to the back end.

    ```js
    const newCharacter = req.body;
    ```

    * After logging the new character in the console, we push it to the `characters` array. Finally we use `res.json` to send a response to the client in JSON format.

    ```js
        console.log(newCharacter);

        characters.push(newCharacter);

        res.json(newCharacter);
    });
    ```

    * 🔑 To test this route in Insomnia, we will make a POST request to `localhost:3000/api/characters`, using the following data:

    ```json
    {
        "routeName": "leia",
        "name": "Leia Organa",
        "role": "General",
        "age": "60",
        "forcePoints": "1000"
    }
    ```

    * Don't forget that the data needs to be JSON, not just JavaScript objects.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What happens to our newly posted data after our server is shut down?

    * 🙋 It's lost forever. In order to prevent this, we would need to save it in a file or database.

    * ☝️ Is Insomnia used in real back-ends?

    * 🙋 Insomnia helps us test all different kinds of routes, including those in production. 

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understanding this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 2, read the [Express Routing documentation](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/basic-routing.html), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 6. Instructor Demo: Serving Static Files (5 min) 

* Navigate to `04-Static/Solved/` in your command line and run `node server.js`.

* Open <http://localhost:3000/> in your browser and explain the following:

    * Navigating to a route on `localhost` displays an HTML page instead of JSON data.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used this to serve all of the HTML routes for the zookeeper and animals pages.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We will use this to serve all of the HTML routes for the zookeeper and animals pages.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We will create a GET route that sends back an HTML file instead of JSON.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Serving Static Files (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Static/README.md`.

```md
# Serving Static Files

In this activity, you will update the home route to return `index.html` when a request is made at `/`.

## Instructions

* Open the [Unsolved/server.js](Unsolved/server.js) file.

* Update the home route `/`.

  * Use `res.sendFile()` and `path.join()` to return `index.html`
```

### 8. Instructor Review: Serving Static Files (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ `res.sendFile()`

    * ✔️ `path.join()`

* Navigate to `04-Static/Solved` from the command line and run `node server.js`.

* Open <http://localhost:3000/> in the browser and point out the following:

    * The page served to us on the `/` route matches the HTML in `index.html`

* Open `04-Static/Solved/server.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

    * In our dependencies, we need to include the `path` module in order to use `path.join()`.

    ```js
    const path = require('path');
    ```
   
    * 🔑 `res.sendFile()` allows us to send back a static file to the client, rather than JSON or a plaintext response. In order to use `sendFile()`, we need to provide the absolute path to the HTML file. 
    
    * 🔑 We can do this by combining the full path of the directory that we're in with the relative path to the file we want to send using `path.join()`. 

    ```js
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'index.html'));
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Why can't we just use `./` instead of `__dirname`?

    * 🙋 `./` refers to the current working directory, which is the directory that `node` is run from. It is important to keep in mind that the `node` can be run from anywhere. We can't guarantee that the user of our application will run `node server.js`, and not `node someParentPath/server.js`.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understanding this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 3, read the [Express.js docs](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Instructor Demo: POST Client (5 min) 

* Navigate to `05-POST-Client/Solved` in your command line and run `node server.js`.

* Open <http://localhost:3000/add> in the browser and point out the following:

    * 🔑 The HTML that is served back to us is different from the `index.html`. This one has form elements.

* Open the Network tab in your browser's Developer Tools and point out the following:
    
    * 🔑 If we fill out the various form fields and hit submit, we can see a POST request is made to our server.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used this to add animals and zookeepers to the Zoo Keepr application in Lesson 3.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We will need to be able to hook up a front-end to a back-end, and allow POST requests to be made. 

    * ☝️ How would we build the back-end part of this?

    * 🙋 We would start by creating a POST route that allows us to accept new characters. Then we would want our characters array to change so that it includes the new character as well.

    * ☝️ How would we build the front-end part of this?
  
    * 🙋 We would change the front-end by scaffolding our HTML, then pseudocode our script functionality to listen for form submission, get the value in the form field, and finally making a POST request to our server.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 10. Student Do: POST Client (20 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `05-POST-Client/README.md`.

```md
# POST Client

In this activity, you will add a route to return `add.html` when a request is made at `/add`.

## Instructions

* Open the [Unsolved/server.js](Unsolved/server.js) file.

  * Create an `/add` route that returns `add.html`. 

* Open the [Unsolved/add.html](Unsolved/add.html) file.

  * Examine the jQuery at the bottom of the file and try to understand what the code is doing.

## Bonus 

* Use Regular Expressions (RegEx), like the following code snippet, to create route names without spaces in the POST route.

  `.replace(/\s+/g, "")`

* You can read more about RegEx Patterns later https://www.regexbuddy.com/regex.html
```

### 11. Instructor Review: POST Client (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ Serve multiple HTML pages

    * ✔️ `$.post()`

* Open `05-POST-Client/Solved/server.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

    * 🔑 We can serve other pages on different routes, just by changing the first argument of `app.get()`. So in the case of our `/add` route, we change the `app.get('/')` to `app.get('/add')`.

    * Then we use `res.sendFile()` and `path.join()` to serve `add.html`:

    ```js
    app.get('/add', (req, res) => {
      res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'add.html'));
    });
    ```

    * If you attempted the bonus question, here is how you would used RegEx to remove the spaces from `newCharacter`. 

    ```js
    newCharacter.routeName = newCharacter.name.replace(/\s+/g, '').toLowerCase();
    ```

* Open `/05-POST-Client/Solved/add.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

    * We can set up an event listener for the click event on our `add` button.

    * We can also use either jQuery or VanillaJS to select the various form fields and extract their values.

    ```js
    $("#add-btn").on("click", function (event) {
        event.preventDefault();
        const newCharacter = {
            name: $("#name").val().trim(),
            role: $("#role").val().trim(),
            age: $("#age").val().trim(),
            forcePoints: $("#force-points").val().trim()
        };
    ```
    * 🔑 Inside the event listener callback, we can make a POST request using `$.post` and our new character object.

    * Then, once the server responds to us, we will `console.log` the new character and `alert()` the user.

    ```js
    $.post("/api/characters", newCharacter)
        .then(function (data) {
            console.log("add.html", data);
            alert("Adding character...");
        });
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What is `req.body` used for?

    * 🙋 `req.body` is whatever is sent in a POST request. We can use the contents of `req.body` to create new items.

    * ☝️ What does `$.post()` do?

    * 🙋 `$.post()` allows us to post data to our sever, then do something after the server returns a response.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understanding this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 3, read [POST Express.js documentation](https://expressjs.com/en/5x/api.html#app.post.method) and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 12. Recap & Promote Additional Resources (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What do you think you absolutely need to know to succeed at the challenge?

    * 🙋 To succeed at the challenge, we need to know how to build routes using Express. We also need to know how to do the following with Express: Accept POST requests, GET requests, serve back data. Lastly, we need to be able to send back HTML to the browser.

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! Remember that we are learning about a large framework that has many methods and techniques. It's going to take a little bit of time before you start to feel comfortable creating servers from scratch.

    * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material as possible?

    * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

    * ☝️ **ONE MORE THING** before we dismiss! In the next module on SQL, you'll be using SQLite for the project you'll build in the lessons, but you will use MySQL in your Virtual Classes and in the weekly Challenge. So you will need to install both SQLite and MySQL before you begin Module 12. For detailed instructions on how to install them, read the `Up and Running` on Module 12.

* Direct students to the additional resources available to them:

    * Reflection and Retrieval

    * Career Connection

    * Dessert Menu
    
### 13. Introduce Upcoming Challenge (5 min)

* Navigate to `01-Class-Content/12-SQL/02-Challenge/Master/` in your command line and run `npm start` to demonstrate the following:

    * When we select "View All Employees," we see the contents of the `employees` table combined with data from other tables.

    * When we select "Add Employee," we can input different data points to insert a new record in the table.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What are we learning?

    * 🙋 We are learning SQL statements like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, and `JOIN` and SQL-related npm packages.

    * ☝️ How does this project build off or extend previously learned material?

    * 🙋 We will use `inquirer` to get user's input and continue to use ES6 classes and syntax.

    * ☝️ How does this project relate to your career goals?

    * 🙋 Most businesses will require using a database for their applications, so understanding SQL will be a huge asset.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 14. Office Hours (30 min)

* Announce office hours and encourage students to stay on the Zoom and start the challenge while they have live support from instructional staff.
