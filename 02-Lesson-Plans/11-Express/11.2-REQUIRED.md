# 11.2 Virtual Class: Express.js

## Overview

In today's virtual class, students will review Express.js server basics. They'll build a "Product Reviews" application that serves both API routes and HTML routes, which is similar to what they're working on for the Challenge. They will use `app.post()` to handle POST requests, and practice implementing data persistence in their back-end application.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Configure an Express.js app to handle POST requests.

* Implement Express.js middleware to be able to read data from a POST request.

* Implement client-side POST requests to submit form data to a server.

* Read and write to a JSON file.

## Instructor Notes

* At the beginning of class, post the link to the [Insomnia download page](https://insomnia.rest/download) in Slack. Instruct students to download and install Insomnia if they have not yet done so.

* Each activity requires students to create a new Express.js server. Students might encounter a common error with the code `EADDRINUSE`, due to the port being used. They can easily resolve this by running one of the following commands depending on their operating system:

  * macOS:

    ```bash
    killall node
    ```

  * Windows:

    ```bash
    taskkill /im node.exe
    ```

* Today's activities also cover persistent storage. Databases are introduced in the next module, so for now we will store data using the Node.js `fs` module and JSON files. To accomplish this, some activities include helper functions in a `/helpers` directory.

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo and to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this module for those who want to further their knowledge.

* Advise students that they will work with MySQL and databases in the next module. They must install MySQL Server on their machine before the week begins. Point students to the [MySQL installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mysql/mysql-installation-guide) for installation instructions.

## Office Hours

Encourage students to work on the remaining module algorithms during Office Hours. Review the algorithm solutions 5–10 minutes before class begins.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What did we learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

  * 🙋 We learned how to use Express.js to set up servers that listen for requests from a client. Clients can be mobile devices, desktop computers, laptops, and even smart fridges! We are moving fast compared to traditional learners. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

  * ☝️ Did anyone have an "Aha!" or "Eureka!" moment this week? When was it and why did things suddenly click for you?

  * 🙋 Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we are thinking about the problem.

  * ☝️ Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

  * 🙋 It's easy to get stuck when you're learning web development. It's important to learn how get unstuck because it happens to the pros, too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups are a great because explaining your problems to someone else often reveals their solution.

### 2. Review Current Challenge (5 min)

* Open `02-Challenge/Main/index.html` in your browser and explain the following:

  * This week's Challenge is to modify a "Note Taker" app that allows us to add notes and save them to a JSON file. It also makes the data persist, which means that anytime we want to view our notes, they'll be there, even if we restart the server.

  * 🔑 On the main page, we can choose to add a new note or view existing notes.

  * 🔑 If we click on an existing note, the create note section is changed to show a detailed view of the note we clicked on.

  * 🔑 We also have the option to delete the note, which removes it from the JSON file it was stored in.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What recently acquired skills will help us build this Challenge?

  * 🙋 We can use Express.js to serve the list of animals or zookeepers.

  * ☝️ How are these skills relevant to a career in web development?

  * 🙋 APIs are a necessary piece of many web applications.

  * ☝️ How will this Challenge improve your portfolio?

  * 🙋 This Challenge will demonstrate knowledge of Express.js and Node.js, which will show that we create back ends for our clients to interact with.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 3. Instructor Demo: POST Requests (5 min)

* In the command line, navigate to `03-POST-Requests/server.js` and run `npm install` and `npm start`.

* Open Insomnia, create a new POST request to `http://localhost:3001/api/reviews`, and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 This demo shows how we can set up POST routes for the Express.js server. To begin, let's open Insomnia and create a new POST request to the endpoint `http://localhost:3001/api/reviews`.

  * 🔑 After making a request to the endpoint, we receive a simple response that the request was received.

  * 🔑 In the terminal, a few console logs also provide us with additional information about the client.

  * 🔑 The `req` object is also being used to dynamically slot in the method attribute that is provided by Express.js.

    ```js
    console.info(req.rawHeaders);

    console.info(`${req.method} request received`);
    ```

  * 🔑 Remember that when creating POST routes, requests also need to be concluded to prevent the client requests from timing out and letting them know that the server is done processing their request.

    ```js
    res.json(`${req.method} request received`);
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We can start by creating a POST route in the Express.js server using the `app.post()` method. Then we use the `req` object to get additional information about the request and client.

### 4. Student Do: POST Requests (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `03-POST-Requests/README.md`, which are also shown here:

    ```md
    # 📖 Implement Logging for GET and POST Requests

    Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

    * As a developer, I want to ensure that my requests are handled based on their HTTP method so that future create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations work as intended.

    ## Acceptance Criteria

    * It is done when I have created a route that logs when a user has made a GET request.

    * It is done when I have created a route that logs when a user has made a POST request.

    * It is done when, if I test my route using Insomnia, GET and POST requests are logged.

### 5. Instructor Review: POST Requests (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel creating POST requests? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use Office Hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ GET vs. POST

  * ✔️ One endpoint for two kinds of requests

* Open `03-POST-Requests/server.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * When we open the `server.js` file, we first import Express.js and set a variable for the port.

    ```js
    const express = require('express');
    const port = 3001;
    ```

  * We also have an `app` variable that is set to the value of the `express()` function.

    ```js
    const app = express();
    ```

  * The routes for both `/api/reviews` and `/api/upvotes` have already been started, so let's finish them.

  * 🔑 In the `/api/reviews` route handler, the first thing we want to do is tell the client that we received their request. We do this by invoking `res.json()` and passing in a message.

    ```js
    res.json(`${req.method} request received to get reviews`);
    ```

  * 🔑 Invoking the `res.json()` method will conclude the request-response cycle, but as far as the server is concerned, we can still run the rest of the code in the code block.

  * We use the `console.info()` method to print a message to the console that a request was received. We construct the output string using the `req.method()` object and string interpolation.

    ```js
    console.info(`${req.method} request received to get reviews`);
    ```

  * While this logic is fresh in our minds, we can finish the `/api/upvotes` GET route.

    ```js
    app.get('/api/upvotes', (req, res) => {
      res.json(`${req.method} request received to retrieve upvote count`);

      console.info(`${req.method} request received to retrieve upvote count`);
    });
    ```

  * Next, we create POST routes for both of these endpoints. Using Express.js, it is possible to create two entirely different routes with the same endpoint.

  * The POST route for `/reviews` and `/upvotes` are functionally identical to the GET routes, except that we use `app.post()` instead of `app.get()`.

    ```js
    app.post('/api/reviews', (req, res) => {
      res.json(`${req.method} request received to add a review`);

      console.info(`${req.method} request received to add a review`);
    });
    ```

  * The POST route for `api/upvotes` looks nearly identical, because the goal is to log the request and the HTTP method.

    ```js
    app.post('/api/upvotes', (req, res) => {
      res.json(`${req.method} request received to upvote`);

      console.info(`${req.method} request received to upvote`);
    });
    ```

  * 🔑 If you want to, when creating routes in Express.js, you can perform some logic to update a resource inside a GET route handler. The different methods on the `app` object are designed to aid organization and readability rather than dictate exactly how APIs should be implemented. However, for the API to be considered RESTful, we should keep the POST logic to POST routes and GET logic to GET routes.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Which HTTP methods can we handle using Express.js?

  * 🙋 Express.js has methods for GET, POST, patch, PUT, DELETE, connect, options, and trace.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [Express.js documentation on basic routing](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/basic-routing.html), and attend Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Post Fetch (5 min)

* In the command line, navigate to `04-POST-Fetch/Solved/` and run `npm install` and `npm start`.

* Open `http://localhost:3001` in your browser to demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 When we run this application, we find that the server starts on port 3001. We also encounter a message to visit `http://localhost:3001/` in the browser.

  * 🔑 When we visit this page in the browser, a form prompts us to submit a review.

  * There are input fields for each item on the page, as well as a Submit button.

  * This exercise adds front-end functionality to make a POST request to the server, using the Fetch API that is built into modern browsers.

  * After the form has been submitted, we get its status and a new ID for the review that was submitted.

  * In the next activity, we will add comments to the functionality of this app.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We would first examine the server-side route handler for posting a new review and use that information to form the POST `fetch()` request on the front end.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `04-POST-Fetch/README.md`.

### 7. Student Do: Post Fetch (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-POST-Fetch/README.md`, which are also shown below.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # 📐 Add Comments to Implementation of Client-Side POST Requests

  Work with a partner to add comments that describe the functionality of the code found in [server.js](./Unsolved/server.js) and [index.js](./Unsolved/public/scripts/index.js).

  ## 📝 Notes

  Where does the information that we want to send to the server reside when we create the `fetch()` request?

  Refer to the documentation:

  [MDN Web Docs on using Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)

  ---

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What other content types could you set when sending a request?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 8. Instructor Review: Post Fetch (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel making POST requests with the Fetch API? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use Office Hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ Fetch API

  * ✔️ Headers

  * ✔️ `body` property

* In the command line, navigate to `04-POST-Fetch/Solved/` and run `npm install` and `npm start`.

* Open `http://localhost:3001` in your browser to demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 When we run this app from the command line and open `http://localhost:3001/`, we are presented with a form to submit a review.

  * 🔑 Note also that the form accepts a username or email address, a product, and finally a review for that product.

  * After submitting the form, we are presented with a status message and the ID for the review that we just submitted.

* Open `04-POST-Fetch/Solved/server.js` in your IDE to demonstrate the following:

  * In the `server.js` file, we require the necessary dependencies, set a port for the server, and initialize the middleware to parse JSON and URL-encoded data.

    ```js
    const express = require('express');
    const path = require('path');
    const uuid = require('./helpers/uuid');

    const port = 3001;

    const app = express();

    app.use(express.json());
    app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

    app.use(express.static('public'));
    ```

  * 🔑 We know that the front end will use the Fetch API to make a POST request to the server, so let's examine the route for handling POST requests to `/api/reviews`.

  * First, we use destructuring assignment to extract the request body into `product`, `review`, and `username` variables.

    ```js
    app.post('/api/reviews', (req, res) => {
      console.info(`${req.method} request received to add a review`);

      const { product, review, username } = req.body;
    ```

  * If all three of these variables exist, we create a new `review` object and a `response` object.

    ```js
    if (product && review && username) {
      const newReview = {
        product,
        review,
        username,
        upvotes: Math.floor(Math.random() * 100),
        review_id: uuid(),
      };

      const response = {
        status: 'success',
        body: newReview,
      };
    ```

  * 🔑 In this demo, we are not writing to the actual file system, so at the end of the route handler, we simply return the `response` object, which contains a `status` and the `newReview` that we created.

    ```js
    app.post('/api/reviews', (req, res) => {
      console.info(`${req.method} request received to add a review`);

      const { product, review, username } = req.body;

      if (product && review && username) {
        const newReview = {
          product,
          review,
          username,
          upvotes: Math.floor(Math.random() * 100),
          review_id: uuid(),
        };

        const response = {
          status: 'success',
          body: newReview,
        };

        console.log(response);
        res.status(201).json(response);
      } else {
        res.status(500).json('Error in posting review');
      }
    })
    ```

  * Let's examine the front end and study the corresponding `fetch()` POST request.

* Open `04-POST-Fetch/Solved/public/scripts/index.js` in your IDE to demonstrate the following:

  * The front-end code contains some variables that select various elements in the DOM.

      ```js
      const userNameInput = document.getElementById('username');
      const productInput = document.getElementById('product');
      const reviewInput = document.getElementById('review');
      const reviewForm = document.getElementById('review-form');
      ```

  * We use the `reviewForm` variable to attach the event listener.

  * 🔑 In the event handler, we prevent the default behavior of the browser by using `e.preventDefault()`, and then we create a `newReview` object from the data that the user enters.

  * Notice that the `newReview` object is very similar to the new `review` object that we created in the back-end route handler.

    ```js
    reviewForm.addEventListener('submit', (e) => {
      e.preventDefault();

      const newReview = {
        username: userNameInput.value.trim(),
        product: productInput.value.trim(),
        review: reviewInput.value.trim(),
      };

      ...
    }
    ```

  * At the end of the event handler, we invoke another helper function, called `postReview()`. This method accepts `newReview` to post, then takes the response data and shows the user an alert.

    ```js
    postReview(newReview)
      .then((data) => alert(`Review added! Review ID: ${data.body.review_id}`))
      .catch((err) => console.error(err));
    ```

  * 🔑 Inside the `postReview()` helper function, we use the Fetch API to make a POST request to the server.

  * Remember that POST requests accept a path or endpoint, and an `options` object. The `options` object has `method`, `headers`, and `body` properties.

  * 🔑 Before we send the `review` object to the server, we coerce the object into a string, using the `JSON.stringify()` method.

  * If the response was successful, we log out the successful response and return the data that was used to create the alert for the client.

  * If an error occurs, we log out that error to the console using `console.error()`.

    ```js
    const postReview = (review) =>
      fetch('/api/reviews', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify(review),
      })
        .then((res) => res.json())
        .then((data) => {
          console.log('Successful POST request:', data);
          return data;
        })
        .catch((error) => {
          console.error('Error in POST request:', error);
        });
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why is it important to stringify an object before sending it to the server?

  * 🙋 The route handler attempts to parse the string it receives from the client into JSON. It will throw an error if the object hasn't been converted before sending the POST request.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on using Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch), and attend Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Instructor Demo: Data Persistence (5 min)

* In the command line, navigate to `05-Data-Persistence/Solved` and run `npm install` and `npm start`.

* Open `http://localhost:3001` in your browser to demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 When we run this app, we are presented with the same review form as last time. If we enter the required information and click Submit, we get a message that includes the review ID.

  * 🔑 There is a feature that has been added to this application that will create a new JSON file for each product that gets reviewed.

  * Let's find out where these files are being saved to the file system.

* Open `05-Data-Persistence/Solved` in your IDE's file explorer to demonstrate the following:

  * Note that in the file tree, we have a new folder called `/db`. A new file has been created with the same name for the product that we reviewed in the front end.

  * Before we can write the data to a file using the `fs` module, we need to convert the `review` object to a string using the `JSON.stringify()` method

  * 🔑 In the next activity we will use what we know about the `fs.writeFile()` method to debug the application.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What do we have to import into the server file to save data to the file system?

  * 🙋 At the top of the server file, we need to require the built-in Node.js `fs` module.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 10. Student Do: Data Persistence (20 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `05-Data-Persistence/README.md`, which are also shown below.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # 🐛 Adding a Review Overwrites Existing JSON

  Work with a partner to resolve the following issues:

  * As a user, I want to be able to append my review to the list of existing reviews so that existing reviews don't get overwritten.

  ## Expected Behavior

  When a user adds a review, the review should append to the list of reviews in the JSON file.

  ## Actual Behavior

  When a user adds a review, the entire JSON file gets overwritten with the new review, and the existing reviews get replaced.

  ## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

  To reproduce the problem, follow these steps:

  1. Run the back-end server by running `npm install` and `npm start`.

  2. Click the link in the terminal to visit `http://localhost:3001/`.

  3. Fill out the necessary fields to add a review.

  4. Check the content of `db/reviews.json` and note that the old entries have been replaced.

  ---

  ## 💡 Hints

  How can the built-in `fs` module accomplish appending data to a JSON file?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * Without having a database, what other tools can you use to persist data on the server?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 11. Instructor Review: Data Persistence (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel making POST requests using the Fetch API? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use Office Hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `fs.writeFile()`

  * ✔️ Reading from the file system

  * ✔️ Appending to the file system

* Open `05-Data-Persistence/Solved/db/reviews.json` in your IDE to demonstrate the following:

  * Notice that a few of the reviews are stored in the JSON file, along with the relevant `review`, `product`, `username`, and `review_id`.

      ```json
      [
        {
          "product": "Happy Hacking Keyboard Professional 2",
          "username": "kbdfan05",
          "review": "It rules!",
          "review_id": "c763"
        },
        {
          "product": "Das Keyboard",
          "review": "I love it, but the keyboard is too big for my desk.",
          "username": "coolperson12",
          "review_id": "121d"
        }
      ]
      ```

* In the command line, navigate to `05-Data-Persistence/Solved/` and run `npm install` and `npm start`.

* Open `http://localhost:3001/` in your browser to demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 On the page, enter a username, product, and a review to use as an example, and then click Submit.

* Open `05-Data-Persistence/Solved/db/reviews.json` in your IDE to demonstrate the following:

  * Note that each review is getting appended to the list of already existing reviews.

  * 🔑 To observe how the reviews are appended rather than overwritten, let's refer to the `app.post()` route for `/api/reviews`.

* Open `05-Data-Persistence/Solved/server.js` in your IDE to demonstrate the following:

  * In the route handler for posting new reviews, we have logic that checks whether the required properties are present in the `req.body` object.

      ```js
      app.post('/api/reviews', (req, res) => {
        console.info(`${req.method} request received to add a review`);

        const { product, review, username } = req.body;

        if (product && review && username) {
          const newReview = {
            product,
            review,
            username,
            review_id: uuid(),
          };
      ```

  * 🔑 The key to resolving this bug is to first read the content of the `reviews` file so that we can add to it. After that, we will be able to write the new list of reviews in the JSON file.

  * 🔑 To read the content of the `reviews.json` file, we use the native `fs.readFile()` method from Node.js. We specify the path for the file that we want to read, the file's encoding, and a callback function.

  * The callback function will accept an `err` argument, which is used for error handling, and a `data` argument, which will contain the content of the `reviews.json` file.

    ```js
    fs.readFile('./db/reviews.json', 'utf8', (err, data) => { }
    ```

  * Inside the callback function for `fs.readFile()`, we start by handling any errors that might have occurred when the file was read.

    ```js
    if (err) {
      console.error(err);
    } else {
    ```

  * If no error exists, we move on to the next step. We parse the content of the file that we just read.

  * We can assume that the data we get back will contain the existing reviews, so we store them in a variable called `parsedReviews`.

    ```js
    const parsedReviews = JSON.parse(data);
    ```

  * The next step we take is to add the new review to the list of existing reviews. To do this, we use the `push()` method because the `parsedReviews` variable is an array of objects.

    ```js
    parsedReviews.push(newReview);
    ```

  * We now have the `newReview` object included in the `parsedReviews` array, so it is time to write the file back to the file system.

  * To save the `parsedReviews` array, we invoke `fs.writeFile()`, which takes a path, the data we want to save, and a callback.

  * In this case, the path is the relative path to the `reviews.json` file. The data is the `parsedReviews` array, and the callback will simply log out any errors or success messages from the write attempt.

    ```js
    fs.writeFile(
      './db/reviews.json',
      JSON.stringify(parsedReviews, null, 4),
      (writeErr) =>
        writeErr
          ? console.error(writeErr)
          : console.info('Successfully updated reviews!')
    );
    ```

      **Note**: The second and third arguments provided by the `JSON.stringify()` method are optional arguments that help with formatting. The first is a `replacer()` function, which we set to null, and the third is the `space` argument that adds indentation, whitespace, and line break characters to make it easier to read.

  * Once we have successfully written to `reviews.json`, we can send the client a response that contains the updated review

    ```js
      const response = {
        status: 'success',
        body: newReview,
      };

      res.status(201).json(response);
    } else {
      res.status(500).json('Error in posting review');
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What do we need to do with the data we get back from `fs.readFile()` to add some content to that data?

  * 🙋 The data we get back from the `fs.readFile()` call has to be parsed, using `JSON.parse()` to convert it to an array, before we can push something to it.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [Node.js documentation on fs](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html), and attend Office Hours to ask for help.

### 12. Recap & Promote Additional Resources (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What do you think you absolutely need to know to succeed at the Challenge?

  * 🙋 To succeed at the Challenge, we need to know how to build routes using Express.js. We also need to know how to use Express.js to accept POST requests, GET requests, and serve back data. Lastly, we need to be able to send back HTML to the browser.

  * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

  * 🙋 All of it! Remember that we are learning about a large framework that has many methods and techniques. It's going to take a little bit of time before you start to feel comfortable creating servers from scratch.

  * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material as possible?

  * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

  * ☝️ **ONE MORE THING** before we dismiss! In the next module on SQL, you'll be using MySQL, so you will need to install both MySQL server and the MySQL Shell before you begin Module 12. For detailed instructions on how to install them, read the [MySQL installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mysql/mysql-installation-guide).

* Direct students to the additional resources available to them:

  * Reflection and Retrieval

  * Career Connection

  * Dessert Menu

### 13. Introduce Upcoming Challenge (5 min)

* Navigate to `01-Class-Content/12-SQL/02-Challenge/Main/` in your command line and run `npm start` to demonstrate the following:

  * When we select "View All Employees", we see the contents of the `employees` table combined with data from other tables.

  * When we select "Add Employee," we can input different data points to insert a new record in the table.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are we learning?

  * 🙋 We are learning SQL statements like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, and `JOIN` and SQL-related npm packages.

  * ☝️ How does this project build on or extend previously learned material?

  * 🙋 We will use Inquirer to get the user's input and continue to use ES6 classes and syntax.

  * ☝️ How does this project relate to your career goals?

  * 🙋 Most businesses require using a database for their applications, so understanding SQL will be a huge asset.

* Answer any questions before ending the class.
