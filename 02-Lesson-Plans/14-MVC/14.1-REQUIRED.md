# Module 14 Virtual Class: Model-View-Controller (MVC)

## Overview 

In today's virtual class, students will practice using Handlebars.js.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Render pages using Handlebars.js

* Use Handlebars.js helpers to iterate through objects and render them on the page

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* Instead of setting up a MySQL database for these activities, students will be given dummy data to use. 

* Although we just finished learning Sequelize, these activities only use Express.js so students can focus solely on Handlebars.js.

* Handlebars.js and the `{{#each}}` helper function are both introduced in Lesson 1.

## Class Instructions 

### 1. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Invite students to post questions in the Zoom chat so TAs and/or the instructor can address them at the end of class.

* Open the lesson's [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13o7o1XT-a-J863ovfEgTK5zP6zaCf7OCc1fQZGy6_hc/edit?usp=sharing) and walk through the following slides on foundation setting:
 
  **Big Picture**: This is an opportunity to look at the big picture of where students are in the course. Take a moment to discuss a few real-world examples of why this week's topics are valuable.

  **Boot Camp Pointers**: Review some logistics that will help students stay on track. This is an opportunity to speak to what students might need at this particular point in the course. 

  **This Week**: Review the key skills students will be learning this week. 

  **This Week's Assignment**: Give a quick summary of this week's Challenge assignment and describe how the skills they learn throughout the week will be applied to it.

  **Career Connection**: Reinforce that students will use the skills they learn this week throughout their careers. It's important for them to know the "why" and "how" behind the "what." Give examples of how these skills are used on the job. If you feel comfortable, share examples of how you have used them in your professional career.

  * This week, students were introduced to the MVC paradigm and spent time building servers and clients using the Handlebars.js library. It's likely you'll have a number of students who don't understand its usefulness if we are going to be moving on to React.

  * Take time to remind students that MVC is insanely popular, and that template engines are used by many different programming languages. In this week's async Career Connection, students were introduced to Thymeleaf for Java, Razor for C#, Jinja for Python, and Blade for Laravel. So they should have an idea of different template frameworks.

  * Take a minute to review what they covered, ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What other languages use templating languages? 

    * 🙋 Essentially all of them! 

    * ☝️ Why is templating so important?

    * 🙋 It's a proven way of creating full-stack web applications, and is used in many web application development languages such as Java, C#, and Python.

  **How to Succeed This Week**: Remind students that they might experience moments of frustration as they learn complex concepts and tools, and that these times are actually proven opportunities to deepen knowledge. Consider sharing something about your personal learning journey. This helps students recognize that everyone starts somewhere and that they are not alone.

  **Today's Objectives**: Outline the concepts that will be covered in today's lesson. Remind students that they can find the relevant activity files in the "Getting Ready for Class" page in their course content.

### 2. Instructor Do: Student Check-In (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

    * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back at what we accomplished and acknowledge that it's a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed&mdash;as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic? 

    * 🙋 Let's do Fist to Five together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 3. Instructor Demo: Ben and Jerry's (5 min) 

* Navigate to `01-Ben-and-Jerrys/Solved/` in your command line and run `npm start`.

* Open the browser and go to <http://localhost:3001/> to demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 We can see a list of Ben and Jerry's ice cream flavors.

    * 🔑 If we want to see additional information about a specific ice cream flavor, we can edit the URL with the number of that flavor; for example, use <http://localhost:3001/1> to see the details of the first listed ice cream flavor.

    * 🔑 We can see the name of the ice cream, the price, and the level of awesomeness. 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used Handlebars.js in Lesson 1 to see the details of a single post.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

    * 🙋 We will need to use Handlebars.js to render the views of our application. 

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We need to use Handlebars.js with Express.js to create a route to view the details of specific ice cream flavors. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Ben and Jerry's (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-Ben-and-Jerrys/README.md`, which are also shown here:

     ```md
     # Ben and Jerry's 

     In this activity, you will use Handlebars.js to render details about specific Ben and Jerry's ice cream flavors. 

     ## Instructions

     * Navigate to the [Unsolved](Unsolved/) folder and run `npm install` in your terminal.

     * Open the [server.js](Unsolved/server.js) file and do the following:

       * Set Handlebars.js as the default template engine.

       * For simplicity, do not use MySQL or Sequelize for this activity. Add the `icecreams` array below as your dummy data:

       const icecreams = [
         {name: 'Milk and Cookies', price: 10, awesomeness: 3},
         {name: 'Chocolate Peanut Butter Split', price: 4, awesomeness: 8},
         {name: 'Bourbon Pecan Pie', price: 1, awesomeness: 1},
         {name: 'Chubby Hubby', price: 5, awesomeness: 7},
         {name: 'Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch', price: 6, awesomeness: 2},
         {name: "Ice Cream Sammie", price: 11, awesomeness: 15 }
       ]

       * Using Handlebars.js and Express, create a route called `/:num`.

         * When the route is hit, it will display the name, price and awesomeness for that specific ice cream.

         * Look at how [all.handlebars](Unsolved/views/all.handlebars) is hard-coded in order to render the right ice cream.

     * In the [Unsolved/views](Unsolved/views/) folder, create a new Handlebars.js file called `icecream.handlebars`.

     * Create a template that will print out the name, price and awesomeness for that specific ice cream.

     ## Hint(s)

     * You may need to consult the [Express Handlebars docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars#usage) for its usage.
     ```

### 5. Instructor Review: Ben and Jerry's (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points (:key:) below to review the following key points (✔️):

  * ✔️ Set up Handlebars

  * ✔️ `/:num` route 

  * ✔️ `icecream.handlebars` file

* Open `01-Ben-and-Jerrys/Solved/server.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 First, we set up Handlebars.js as the default template engine.

     ```js
     app.engine('handlebars', exphbs({ defaultLayout: 'main' }));
     app.set('view engine', 'handlebars');
     ```

  * Next, we add the dummy data `icecreams` since we are not using MySQL as a database. 

     ```js
     const icecreams = [
       { name: 'Milk and Cookies', price: 10, awesomeness: 3 },
       { name: 'Chocolate Peanut Butter Split', price: 4, awesomeness: 8 },
       { name: 'Bourbon Pecan Pie', price: 1, awesomeness: 1 },
       { name: 'Chubby Hubby', price: 5, awesomeness: 7 },
       { name: 'Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch', price: 6, awesomeness: 2 },
       { name: 'Ice Cream Sammie', price: 11, awesomeness: 15 }
     ];
     ```

  * We have a GET route to get the list of all ice cream flavors.
  
     ```js
     app.get('/', (req, res) => {
       res.render('all');
     });
     ```
  
 * [all.handlebars](Solved/views/all.handlebars) was hard-coded for our activity purposes.

     ```html
     <h1>Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream</h1>
     <ol>
       <li>Milk and Cookies</li>
       <li>Chocolate Peanut Butter Split</li>
       <li>Bourbon Pecan Pie</li>
       <li>Chubby Hubby</li>
       <li>Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch</li>
       <li>Ice Cream Sammie</li>
     </ol>
     ```

  * 🔑 We create a `/:num` route that will display the details for a specific ice cream flavor. We will get the number from the `req.params.num` but we need to subtract 1 in order to grab the right data from the `icecreams` array.

     ```js
     app.get('/:num', (req, res) => {
       return res.render('icecream', icecreams[req.params.num - 1]);
     });
     ```

* Open `01-Ben-and-Jerrys/Solved/views/icecream.handlebars` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 We create a template that will print out the details of the specific ice cream that is sent over:

     ```handlebars
     <p>Flavor: {{name}}</p>
     <p>Price: ${{price}}</p>
     <p>Awesomeness: {{awesomeness}}</p>
     ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What is the benefit of using a template engine?

    * 🙋 A template engine enables you to use static template files in your application. At runtime, the template engine replaces variables in a template file with actual values, and transforms the template into an HTML file sent to the client. This approach makes it easier to design an HTML page.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 1, read the [Express Handlebars docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars#usage), and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Pets or Animals (5 min) 

* Navigate to `02-Pets-or-animals/Solved/` in your command line and run `npm start`.

* Open the browser and go to <http://localhost:3001/all-pets> to demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 Here we see a list of all the animals that are considered pets.

* Open the browser and go to <http://localhost:3001/all-non-pets> to demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 Here we see a list of all the animals that are NOT considered pets.

  * Instead of typing out each animal's details, we are using a Handlebars.js helper function to loop through the animals and print out the details for each animal.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We used Handlebars.js helper functions in Lesson 1 to loop through the posts of our CMS.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

  * 🙋 We will need to use Handlebars.js helper functions to iterate through data and render them on to the page.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We need to loop through animals using a helper function and print out the details for each animal on to the page. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Pets or Animals (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Pets-or-animals/README.md`, which are also shown here:

     ```md
     # Pets or Animals

     In this activity, you will use Handlebars.js built-in helpers to render details about animals.

     ## Instructions

     * Navigate to the [Unsolved](Unsolved/) folder and run `npm install` in your terminal.

     * Open the [server.js](Unsolved/server.js) file and do the following:

       * Set Handlebars.js as the default template engine.

       * For simplicity, do not use MySQL or Sequelize for this activity. Use the given `animals` array as your dummy data. 

       * Modify the `/all-pets` route so that only the animals that are pets are sent to the `index.handlebars` file.

       * Modify the `/all-non-pets` route so that only the animals that are not pets are sent to the `index.handlebars` file.

     * In the [Unsolved/views/index.handlebars](Unsolved/views/index.handlebars) file, loop through the animals sent to this page and print out the details for each animal using the appropriate Handlebars.js helper function.

     ## Hint(s)

     * You may need to consult the [Express Handlebars Helpers docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars#helpers) on how to use the built-in helpers. 
     ```

### 8. Instructor Review: Pets or Animals (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points (:key:) below to review the following key points (✔️):

    * ✔️ `/all-pets` route

    * ✔️ `/all-non-pets` route

    * ✔️ `{{#each}}`

* Open `02-Pets-or-animals/Solved/server.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * First, we set Handlebars.js as the default template engine.

       ```js
       app.engine('handlebars', exphbs({ defaultLayout: 'main' }));
       app.set('view engine', 'handlebars');
       ```

    * 🔑 In the `/all-pets` route, we need to create an object of the animals array to send over to the `index.handlebars` file. 

       ```js
       const data = {
         animals: []
       };
       ```

    * We need to only add the animals that are pets to this object. We iterate through the animals using a `for` loop and check if the animal's `pet` attribute is set to `true`.

       ```js
       for (let i = 0; i < animals.length; i++) {
         // Get the current animal.
         let currentAnimal = animals[i];

         // Check if this animal is a pet.
         if (currentAnimal.pet) {
           // If so, push it into our data.animals array.
           data.animals.push(currentAnimal);
         }
       }
       ```

    * Then we send only those animals to `index.handlebars`.

       ```js
       res.render('index', data);
       ```

    * 🔑 We repeat for the `/all-non-pets` route. But this time we are checking if the animal is NOT a pet.

       ```js
       for (let i = 0; i < animals.length; i++) {
         // Get the current animal.
         let currentAnimal = animals[i];

         // Check if this animal is a pet.
         if (!currentAnimal.pet) {
           // If not, push it into our data.animals array.
           data.animals.push(currentAnimal);
         }
       }
       ```

* Open `02-Pets-or-animals/Solved/views/index.handlebars` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 Using a combination of HTML and Handlebars.js, we need to create a template that will print out the details of each animal that is sent to this page.

        ```handlebars 
       <ul>
         {{#each animals}}
         <li>
           <p>Type: {{animalType}}</p>
           <p>Pet: {{pet}}</p>
           <p>Fierceness: {{fierceness}}</p>
         </li>
         {{/each}}
       </ul>
       ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What are some other helper functions that would be useful in iterating over data and rendering them to the page?

    * 🙋 The `{{#if}}`, `{{#unless}}`, `{{#each}}`, and `{{#with}}` helpers are all useful in rendering only the details that are needed onto the page. Helpers are the place where this kind of logic is defined. 

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 1, read the [Express Handlebars Helpers docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars#helpers), and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

    * 🙋 We learned about the usefulness of Handlebars.js and the `{{#each}}` helper function. 

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful. 

    * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

    * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer. 

    * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

    * 🙋 Handlebars.js is covered all throughout the module, starting with Lesson 1.

    * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Use student answers to transition to Office Hours.

### 10. Challenge Review (30 min)

* Take this time to help get students unblocked on the current Challenge that they are working through.

* Expect that students may ask for the following:

  * Further review on a particular subject

  * Debugging assistance

  * Help with computer issues

  * Guidance with a particular tool
