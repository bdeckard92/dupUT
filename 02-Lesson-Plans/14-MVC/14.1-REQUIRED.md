# Module 14 Virtual Class: Model-View-Controller (MVC)

## Overview

In today's virtual class, students will practice using Handlebars.js. Starting with hardcoded data, they will practice using template engines on the front end by implementing Handlebars.js expressions and built-in helpers.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Implement MVC modularization in a full-stack web application.

* Render dynamic HTML using the Handlebars.js template engine.

* Dynamically pass data to other helpers or components using built-in helpers.

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and review the activities before class. Try to anticipate any questions that students might have.

* This unit introduces students to the template engine **Handlebars.js**. Students might not use Handlebars.js in their future careers, but learning this tool will help introduce them to template engines, prepare them to work with React.js, and demonstrate the MVC framework.

* Today's activities include hardcoded data in the `dish-routes.js` file to ease students into using Handlebars.js. The next lesson will actually use Sequelize and MySQL to handle data logic on the back end.

* During activities, quietly visit a few breakout rooms, ask the groups whether they are comfortable with the activity, and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* The basics of Handlebars were covered in Lesson 1.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Invite students to post questions in the Zoom chat so that TAs or the instructor can address them at the end of class.

* Open the lesson's [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13o7o1XT-a-J863ovfEgTK5zP6zaCf7OCc1fQZGy6_hc/edit?usp=sharing) and review the following slides on foundation setting:

  **Big Picture**: This is an opportunity to look at the big picture of where students are in the course. Take a moment to discuss a few real-world examples of why this week's topics are valuable.

  **Boot Camp Pointers**: Review some logistics that will help students stay on track. This is an opportunity to speak to what students might need at this particular point in the course.

  **This Week**: Review the key skills students will be learning this week.

  **This Week's Assignment**: Give a quick summary of this week's Challenge assignment and describe how the skills they learn throughout the week will be applied to it.

  **Career Connection**: Reinforce that students will use the skills they learn this week throughout their careers. It's important for them to know the "why" and "how" behind the "what." Give examples of how these skills are used on the job. If you feel comfortable, share examples of how you have used them in your professional career.

  * This week, students were introduced to the MVC paradigm and spent time building servers and clients using the Handlebars.js library. You'll likely have a number of students who don't understand its usefulness if we are going to move on to React.

  * Remind students that MVC is hugely popular and that template engines are used by many programming languages. In this week's async Career Connection, students were introduced to Thymeleaf for Java, Razor for C#, Jinja for Python, and Blade for Laravel -- so they should have an idea of different template frameworks.

  * Take a minute to review what they covered. Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What other languages use templating languages?

    * 🙋 Essentially all of them!

    * ☝️ Why is templating so important?

    * 🙋 It's a proven way of creating full-stack web applications, and it is used in many web application development languages, such as Java, C#, and Python.

  **How to Succeed This Week**: Remind students that they might experience moments of frustration as they learn complex concepts and tools, and that these times are actually proven opportunities to deepen knowledge. Consider sharing something about your personal learning journey. This helps students recognize that everyone starts somewhere and that they are not alone.

  **Today's Objectives**: Outline the concepts that will be covered in today's lesson. Remind students that they can find the relevant activity files in the "Getting Ready for Class" page in their course content.

### 2. Instructor Do: Student Check-In (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

  * 🙋 You are adding another layer to your full-stack skill set. It's important to look back at what you've accomplished and acknowledge that it's a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed&mdash;as long as you don’t give up.

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic?

  * 🙋 Let's do Fist to Five together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 3. Instructor Demo: Handlebars.js Expressions (5 min)

* Navigate to `01-Handlebars-Expressions/Solved/` in your command line and run `npm install` and `npm start`.

* Open the browser and go to <http://localhost:3001/> to demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 The MVC architectural pattern is used in most modern web applications.

  * 🔑 The MVC framework includes Models, Views, and Controllers. The **Controller** is the interface between the **View** and the **Model**. It processes requests, uses the Model to manipulate data, and sends data to the View to render.

  * 🔑 The view in this application shows a list of current menu items that guests want served at a potluck.

  * 🔑 For now the dishes are hardcoded, but in the future we will pull them from a database.

  * 🔑 If we want to display additional information about a specific item, we can edit the URL with the number of that dish; for example, use <http://localhost:3001/dish/1> to display the details of the first potluck dish.

  * 🔑 We can display the name of the dish and a description of the dish.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We used Handlebars.js to find the details of a single post.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

  * 🙋 We will need to use Handlebars.js to render the views of our application.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We need to use Handlebars.js with Express.js to create a route to view the details of specific dishes.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Handlebars Expressions (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-Handlebars-Expressions/README.md`, which are also shown here:

  ```md
  # 🏗️ Implement a GET Route for Food Item Descriptions

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a party guest, I want to find a description of one food item that will be at the potluck when I visit `http://localhost:3001/dish/:num`.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when the route called `/dish/:num` is properly configured to retrieve and return a food item and its description.

  * It's done when the view displays a description for the food item, where the list number matches the route `/dish/:num`.

  ## Assets

  The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

  ![A screenshot displays a "Potluck Party!" webpage, including the name and description for a pork gyoza dish.](images/dish-description.png)

  ## 💡 Hints

  How can you ensure that the correct Handlebars.js template is rendered?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * How can we render an array of objects using Handlebars.js?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 5. Instructor Review: Handlebars.js Expressions (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with Handlebars.js expressions? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use Office Hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ GET route for `/dish/:num`

  * ✔️ Handlebars.js expressions

* Open `01-Handlebars-Expressions/Solved/controllers/dish-routes.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 To render a description for a dish, we first need to build a route for `/dish/:num`.

  * We render the `dish` template by passing it in as an argument. Then we use params to select the correct dish to render in the template, based on the index of the object. Now we have access to a dish description through a `dish` object, as follows:

    ```js
    router.get('/dish/:num', async (req, res) => {
      return res.render('dish', dishes[req.params.num - 1]);
    });
    ```

* Open `01-Handlebars-Expressions/Solved/views/dish.handlebars` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We create a Handlebars.js expression, `{{ description }}`, passing in the `description` key name:

    ```hbs
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>
        Description:
        {{description}}
      </p>
    </div>
    ```

* Run `npm install` and `npm start` from the command line.

* Navigate to <http://local:host3001/dish/1> and demonstrate the following:

  * Now when we view the page for one dish, we find the name of that dish and the dish description.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What is the syntax for a Handlebars.js expression?

  * 🙋 `{{ data }}`

  * ☝️ How do we render data using a Handlebars.js expression?

  * 🙋 Inside the curly brackets, we insert the key name of the value we want to render.

  * ☝️ How does this relate to MVC?

  * 🙋 The Controller passes data to the View via a route, and the View renders that data in the browser.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [Handlebars.js documentation on expressions](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/expressions.html), and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Built-in Helpers (5 min)

* Navigate to `02-Built-In-Helpers/Solved/` in your command line and run `npm start`.

* Open the browser and go to <http://localhost:3001/> to demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 Here we find a list of all the dishes.

  * 🔑 Using Handlebars.js, we can conditionally render each dish based on some criteria, using built-in helpers. For example, we can render only the dishes that have nuts.

  * 🔑 Additionally, we can use the `each` helper to iterate over an array of objects.

  * 🔑 In this example, the dishes are no longer hardcoded in the `all.handlebars` view. Instead, we can pass in an array of dishes to the View, and the View will iterate over the array and render each item.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ When should we use built-in helpers?

  * 🙋 If we need to iterate over data or conditionally render blocks of code.

  * ☝️ Where would we include built-in helpers?

  * 🙋 We can include built-in helpers in Handlebars.js templates.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Built-in Helpers (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Built-In-Helpers/README.md`, which are also shown here:

  ```md
  # 📖 Conditionally Render Food Allergens

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a party guest, I want to know whether a food item contains nuts.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when the View displays the message "Contains Nuts" under the food items that contain nuts.

  ## 📝 Notes

  Refer to the documentation:

  [Handlebars.js documentation on built-in helpers](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/builtin-helpers.html#if)

  ## 💡 Hints

  Which built-in helper conditionally renders a block?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * Which built-in helper method is the inverse of `#if`? What is a use case for rendering a block if an expression is a falsy value?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 8. Instructor Review: Built-in Helpers (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel using built-in helpers? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use Office Hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `#if`

* Open `02-Built-In-Helpers/Solved/controllers/dish-routes.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * The dish data includes a Boolean (`has_nuts`) that is set to `true` for the dishes that contain nuts, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    {
      id: 2,
      dish_name: 'Cheese Plate with Spanish Chorizo',
      description: 'Manchego, Iberico, Cabrales, fig jam, grapes, pecans, and Spanich Chorizo',
      has_nuts: true,
    },
    ```

* Open `02-Built-In-Helpers/Solved/views/dish.handlebars` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We want to make sure that the message "Contains Nuts" is only rendered for dish objects that actually contain nuts. To do this, we need to conditionally render a block of code with the built-in `#if` helper.

  * 🔑 We provide `has_nuts` as the condition when we open the `#if` helper. Then we include the block of code that we want to conditionally render. Finally, we close `#if`, as follows:

    ```hbs
    {{#if has_nuts}}
      <p class="has-nuts">
        Contains Nuts
      </p>
    {{/if}}
    ```

* Run `npm install` and `npm start` from the command line.

* Navigate to <http://local:host3001/dish/2> in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * The message "Contains Nuts" shows up when a dish contains nuts!

* Navigate to <http://local:host3001/dish/1> in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * The message is not being rendered here, because the dish does not contain nuts.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ When is it a good idea to use a Handlebars.js built-in helper?

  * 🙋 We might want to use built-in helpers when we need to iterate over a list, conditionally render a block of code, and so on.

  * ☝️ How do built-in helpers relate to MVC?

  * 🙋 Built-in helpers relate to the View in the MVC framework because they aid an application in displaying the right data to the user at the right time.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [Handlebars.js documentation on built-in helpers](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/builtin-helpers.html#each), and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Everyone Do: Prettier (30 min)

* Open the [Prettier website](https://prettier.io/) in your browser and explain the following:

  * ESLint will highlight code that doesn't meet certain standards, but the developer still must make those changes.

  * Prettier is a library that will automatically format your code, using either its own rules or rules that you and your team configure.

  * Prettier includes rules like adding spaces between certain keywords, moving chained methods to a new line, adding trailing commas after object properties, and keeping quotes consistent.

  * Prettier and ESLint work hand in hand, because Prettier is more concerned with visual formatting, whereas ESLint focuses on the code itself.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `Git-Guide/README.md`.

* While everyone is working on the activity, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

* Open `Git-Guide/Solved/package.json` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We add `prettier` and the `eslint-config-prettier` plugin to the project's dependencies, as follows:

    ```json
    "devDependencies": {
      "eslint": "^7.12.1",
      "eslint-config-prettier": "^6.15.0",
      "prettier": "^2.1.2"
    }
    ```

* Open `Git-Guide/Solved/.prettierrc.json` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We create a Prettier config file to specify an additional rule for single quotes:

    ```json
    {
      "singleQuote": true
    }
    ```

* Open `Git-Guide/Solved/.prettierignore` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We create a `.prettierignore` file to exclude Markdown files, as follows:

    ```text
    *.md
    ```

* Open `Git-Guide/Solved/.eslintrc.json` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We update the ESLint config file to make ESLint aware of Prettier:

    ```json
    "extends": ["prettier"]
    ```

* 🔑 We can run Prettier once using the command `npx prettier`, or we can install the VS Code extension to automatically format files when saving.

### 10. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

  * 🙋 We learned about the usefulness of Handlebars.js and the `{{#each}}` helper function.

  * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

  * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful.

  * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

  * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

  * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

  * 🙋 Handlebars.js is covered all throughout the module, starting with Lesson 1.

  * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Answer any questions before ending the class.
