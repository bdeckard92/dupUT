# Module 14 Instructor Overview: MVC

## Overview

In this week's virtual classes, you'll mainly review Handlebars, including helper functions and partials. You will also review implementing sessions using `express-session`.

You will also announce the upcoming group project and the group members during this week's Required Class.

## Virtual Classes

[Recommended Class](./14.1-RECOMMENDED.md)

[Required Class](./14.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* During this week's Required Class, information about the upcoming group project must go out!

  * Start thinking about project groups. This time, assign 3 students per group, all around the **same** skill level.  

  * Look over the [project requirements](../../01-Class-Content/14-MVC/04-Supplemental/Project-Requirements.md). 

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* Instead of setting up a MySQL database for this week's activities, students will be given dummy data to use. 

* Although we just finished learning Sequelize, these activities only use Express so students can focus simply on Handlebars and `express-session`.

## Career Connection

During each lesson that students work through, they will also view a Career Connection section that will tie together the academic content with Career Services and how this material will be applicable to them in their future career.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Director and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careerservicesonlineevents.splashthat.com/).
