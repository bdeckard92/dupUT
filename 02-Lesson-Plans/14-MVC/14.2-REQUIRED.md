# Module 14 Virtual Class (Required): MVC

## Overview 

In today's required virtual class, students will practice using Handlebars helper functions and partials. Students will also implement sessions using `express-session`.

Students will also be assigned to their project groups and go over the project requirements.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Utilize the Handlebars `{{#each}}`, `{{#if}}`, `{{#unless}}` helper functions

* Create Handlebars partials to reuse templates

* Implement user sessions using `express-session`


## Instructor Notes 

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* Instead of setting up a MySQL database for these activities, students will be given dummy data to use. 

* Although we just finished learning Sequelize, these activities only use Express so students can focus simply on Handlebars and `express-session`.

* Handlebars helper functions are introduced in Lesson 1 and used throughout the module. Handlebars partials were used in Lesson 4, and `express-session` was used in Lesson 2.

* @TODO Be prepared to announce project groups and go over the [project requirements]().

## Office Hours

Encourage students to work on the remaining module algorithms during Office Hours. Review the algorithm solutions 5–10 minutes before class begins or during Office Hours after class.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What did you learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

    * 🙋 We learned about Handlebars, which is a template engine, and sessions. We are moving fast compared to traditional learners. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ Did anyone have an "Aha!" or "Eureka!" moment this week? When was it and why did things suddenly click for you? 

    * 🙋 Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we're thinking about it.

    * ☝️ Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

    * 🙋 It's easy to get stuck when you're learning web development. It's important to learn how to get unstuck because it happens to the pros too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the tool's official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups are great because explaining your problems to someone else often reveals the solution. 


### 2. Review Current Challenge (5 min)

@TODO USE THE FOLLOWING FOR BROWSER AND/OR COMMAND LINE DEMOS, RESPECTIVELY. REMOVE IF UNUSED
* Open `@TODO/folder/file` in your browser and demonstrate the following:
* Run `@TODO/folder/file { AND ARGS, IF ANY }` from the command line and demonstrate the following: 

    * @TODO { WHEN WE DO THIS, IT DOES THAT. }

    * @TODO { WE ALSO SEE THESE THINGS. }

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What recently acquired skills will help us build this challenge?

    * 🙋 We will use Handlebars to render our views and `express-session` to implement sessions.

    * ☝️ How are these skills relevant to a career in web development?

    * 🙋 User authentication and sessions are critical parts to building secure applications. All employers will want to provide user authentications in their applications.

    * ☝️ How will this challenge improve your portfolio?

    * 🙋 This will demonstrate a firm understanding of template engines and user authentication.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 3. Instructor Demo: Library Books (5 min) 

* Navigate to `03-Library-Books/Solved` in your command line and run `npm start`.

* Open the browser and go to `localhost:3001` to demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 We see the following details about each book: `title`, `author`, and `read` status. 

    * 🔑 We see two lists of books depending on whether they've been read or not. 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used Handlebars to render the details of a post in Lesson 1. We also used Handlebars helper functions in Lesson 1 to loop through the posts of the CMS.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We will need to use Handlebars and its helper functions to iterate through data and render them to the page. 

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We would need to send the books array as an object to the `index.handlebars` file and use the helper functions to iterate through the books and render their details in two lists according to the `read` status.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 4. Student Do: Library Books  (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `03-Library-Books/README.md`.

```md
# Library Books

In this activity, you will use Handlebars built-in helpers to render details about library books.

## Instructions

* Navigate to the [Unsolved](Unsolved/) folder and run `npm install` in your terminal.

* Open the [server.js](Unsolved/server.js) file and do the following:

  * Set Handlebars as the default template engine.

  * For simplicity, do not use MySQL or Sequelize for this activity. Use the given `books` array as your dummy data. 

  * Modify the `/` route so that all the books are sent to the `index.handlebars` file. 

    * Remember, Handlebars requires an object to be sent to the `index.handlebars` file, not an array!

* In the [Unsolved/views/index.handlebars](Unsolved/views/index.handlebars) file, loop through the books sent to this page.

  * For `{{#each}}` of the books, check `{{#if}}` the book has been read using the appropriate helper functions.

  * In an unordered list, print out the details of the books in the correct list.

* To test if everything is working properly, run `npm start` in your terminal and navigate to `localhost:3001` in your browser. 

  * You should be able to see all of the books listed according to their `read` status.

## Hint(s)

* You may need to consult the [Express Handlebars Helpers docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars#helpers) on how to use the build-in helpers. 
```

### 5. Instructor Review: Library Books  (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ Set up Handlebars

    * ✔️ `/` route

    * ✔️ `{{#each}}`
    
    * ✔️ `{{#if}}`
    
    * ✔️ `{{#unless}}`

* Open `03-Library-Books/Solved/server.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 First, we set up Handlebars as the default template engine.

    ```js
    app.engine('handlebars', exphbs({ defaultLayout: 'main' }));
    app.set('view engine', 'handlebars');
    ```
    
    * 🔑 In the `/` route, we need to create an object of the books array to send over to the `index.handlebars` file. 

    ```js
    app.get('/', (req, res) => {
      const data = {
        library: books
      };
      res.render('index', data);
    });
    ```

* Open `03-Library-Books/Solved/views/index.handlebars` in your IDE and explain the following:

    * Using a combination of HTML and Handlebars, we need to create a template that will print out the details of each book that is sent to this page.

    * 🔑 First, we need to go through `{{#each}}` book that has been sent over.

    * 🔑 For the first list, we only want the books that have been read. We use the `{{#if}}` helper method to check each of the book's `read` value to see if it is set to `true`.

    * Then we print out the details of only those books:

    ```handlebars
    <ul>
      {{#each library}}
      {{#if read}}
      <li>
        <p>Title: {{title}}</p>
        <p>Author: {{author}}</p>
        <p>Read: {{read}}</p>
      </li>
      {{/if}}
      {{/each}}
    </ul>
    ```

    * 🔑 For the second list, we only want the books that have not been read yet. We use the `{{#unless}}` helper method as the inverse of the `{{#if}}` helper. Its block will be rendered only if the `read` status is `false`. 

    ```handlebars
    <ul>
      {{#each library}}
      {{#unless read}}
      <li>
        <p>Title: {{title}}</p>
        <p>Author: {{author}}</p>
        <p>Read: {{read}}</p>
      </li>
      {{/unless}}
      {{/each}}
    </ul>
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How are Handlebars helper functions helpful?

    * 🙋 The `{{#if}}`, `{{#unless}}`, `{{#each}}`, and `{{#with}}` helpers are all useful in rendering only the details that are needed onto the page. Helpers are the place where this kind of logic is defined. 

    * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [Handlebars Build-in Helpers docs](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/builtin-helpers.html), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 6. Instructor Demo: Read Books  (5 min) 

* Navigate to `04-Read-Books/Solved` in your command line and run `npm start`.

* Open the browser and go to `localhost:3001` to demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 We see the same two lists of books as the last activity. The only difference is that this page has been rendered through the use of Handlebars partials. 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used Handlebars partials to render the comments of posts in Lesson 4.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We will use Handlebars partials for any HTML code that will be repeated or reused in our application.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We need to take the HTML code for printing out the details of each book and put it in a Handlebars partial file.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 7. Student Do: Read Books  (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Read-Books/README.md`.

```md
# Read Books

In this activity, you will use Handlebars partials to reuse the template that displays the book details.

## Instructions

* Navigate to the [Unsolved](Unsolved/) folder and run `npm install` in your terminal.

* Create a folder called `partials` inside the `views` folder.

* Inside the `partials` folder, create another folder called `books`.

* Inside the `books` folder, create a Handlebars partial file called `book-block.handlebars`. 

  * Write the code for printing out the book details for each book (`title`, `author`, `read`).

* Open the [index.handlebars](Unsolved/views/index.handlebars) file and do the following:

  * Replace the code that renders the book details with Handlebars partial file you created above.

* To test if everything is working properly, run `npm start` in your terminal and navigate to `localhost:3001` in your browser. 

  * You should be able to see all of the books listed according to their `read` status.

## Hint(s)

* You may need to consult the [Handlebars Partials docs](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/partials.html#basic-partials) on how to use partials. 
```

### 8. Instructor Review: Read Books  (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ `book-block.handlebars` file

    * ✔️ `{{> books/book-block}}`

* Open `04-Read-Books/Solved/views/partials/books/book-block.handlebars` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * Make sure students created the folder structure correctly: `Unsolved/views/partials/books/`

    * 🔑 Copy and paste the code for printing out the details of each book from the `index.handlebars` file into this `book-block.handlebars` file.

    ```handlebars
    <li>
      <p>Title: {{title}}</p>
      <p>Author: {{author}}</p>
      <p>Read: {{read}}</p>
    </li>
    ```

* Open `04-Read-Books/Solved/views/index.handlebars` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 Replace the code for printing out the details of each book with `{{> books/book-block}}` in both lists.

    ```handlebars
    <ul>
        {{#each library}}
        {{#if read}}
        {{> books/book-block}}
        {{/if}}
        {{/each}}
    </ul>

    <ul>
        {{#each library}}
        {{#unless read}}
        {{> books/book-block}}
        {{/unless}}
        {{/each}}
    </ul>
    ```

    * Notice how we are using the same partial for both lists. That's the beauty of partials; we can reuse the same template! 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ When can we use Handlebars partials?

    * 🙋 We can use partials whenever we need to reuse a template, like a form to create or edit a post.

    * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 4, read the [Handlebars Partials docs](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/partials.html), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 9. Instructor Demo: Count Visits  (5 min) 

* Navigate to `05-Count-Visits/Solved` in your command line and run `npm start`.

* Open the browser and go to `localhost:3001` to demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 We are greeted with a message.
    
    * 🔑 After we refresh the page, we are greeted with a message displaying how many times we have visited the page."

    * If we keep refreshing the page, that number will go up. It is keeping count of how many times we visited the page!

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used `express-session` in Lesson 2 when creating and destroying a session for when a user logs in and out.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We will need to implement `express-session` for authentication in our application.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We need to create a session variable that will keep count of how many times the user visits the page. We also need a session variable that will check if this is the first time a user visits the page. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 10. Student Do: Count Visits  (20 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `05-Count-Visits/README.md`.

```md
# Count Visits

In this activity, you will use `express-session` to keep track of how many times a user visits a page.

## Instructions

* Navigate to the [Unsolved](Unsolved/) folder and run `npm install` in your terminal.

* Open the [index.handlebars](Unsolved/views/index.handlebars) file and examine the code on top.

  * If this is the first time the user is visiting the page, they will be welcomed with a special message. 
  
  * Otherwise, the user will know how many times they have visited the page. 

* Open the [server.js](Unsolved/server.js) file and do the following:

  * Require the `express-session` module.

  * Set up sessions with a `secret` option set to a random string, a `resave` option set to `false`, and a `saveUninitialized` option set to `false`. 

  * In the `/` route, if the `countVisit` session variable exists, increment it by 1 and set the `firstTime` session variable to `false`.

  * If the `countVisit` session variable doesn't already exist, set it to 1 and set the `firstTime` session variable to `true`.

  * In the `data` object, include the `books` array, `countVisit` and `firstTime` session variables to be sent over to `index.handlebars`.

* To test if everything is working properly, run `npm start` in your terminal and navigate to `localhost:3001` in your browser. 

  * You should be greeted with "This is your first time visiting the Library!"

  * Refresh your browser and you will see "You have visited the Library ## times!" incrementing every time you refresh.

## Hint(s)

* Take a look at `index.handlebars` to see how the variables need to be named in the `data` object.

* You may need to consult the [Express-Session docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) on how to implement sessions using `express-session`.
```


### 11. Instructor Review: Count Visits  (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ Set up sessions

    * ✔️ `countVisit` session variable

    * ✔️ `firstTime` session variable

* Open `05-Count-Visits/Solved/views/index.handlebars` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * We are checking `{{#if}}` the `firstTime` value is `true`. If it is, the message "This is your first time visiting the Library!" will be printed on the screen. If `{{else}}`, the message, "You have visited the Library {{countVisit}} times!" will be printed. 

    ```handlebars
    <h3>Welcome to the Library!
      {{#if firstTime}}
      This is your first time visiting the Library!
      {{else}}
      You have visited the Library {{countVisit}} times!
      {{/if}}
    </h3>
    ```

* Open `05-Count-Visits/Solved/server.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * First, we require the `express-session` module.

    ```js
    const session = require(`express-session`);
    ```
    
    * 🔑 Next, we set up the session with a `secret`, `resave`, and `saveUninitialized` option.

    ```js
    app.use(
      session({
        secret: 'This is a major secret!',
        resave: false,
        saveUninitialized: false
      })
    );
    ```

    * 🔑 In the `/` route, we check if the `countVisit` session variable exists. If `true`, then we increment the `countVisit` session variable by 1.

    * 🔑 We also set the `firstTime` variable to `false`.

    ```js
    app.get('/', (req, res) => {
      if (req.session.countVisit) {
        req.session.countVisit++;
        req.session.firstTime = false;
      } 
    ```

    * If the `countVisit` session variable doesn't exist, we initialize the variable and set it to 1. We also initialize and set the `firstTime` session variable and set it to `true`.

    ```js
    else {
      req.session.countVisit = 1;
      req.session.firstTime = true;
    }
    ```

    * Lastly, we need to send all this data to `index.handlebars` as an object. 

    ```js
    const data = {
      library: books,
      countVisit: req.session.countVisit,
      firstTime: req.session.firstTime
    };
    res.render('index', data);
    });
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How does user authentication work?

    * 🙋 In short, the users will provide their credentials, like a username and password. That info is compared with all of the other user credentials on file. When a match is found, the user will be granted access to the system. 

    * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 2, read the [Express Sessions docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 12. Recap & Promote Additional Resources (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What do you think you absolutely need to know to succeed at the challenge?

    * 🙋 You will need to know Handlebars and `express-session` to build your full-stack blog application.

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it is not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful. 

    * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material prior to class as possible?

    * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

* Direct students to the additional resources available to them:

    * Reflection and Retrieval

    * Career Connection

    * Dessert Menu

### 13. Introduce Group Project (5 min)

* Announce the project groups.

    * Encourage the groups to set up a time this weekend to brainstorm project ideas. 

    * Project ideas will be approved by the instructor by next week's Module 15 Recommended Class.

* Go over project requirements.

    * @TODO Add the [project requirements]() to the student-facing repo and go over them briefly.

    ```md
    # Project Requirements
    ```

    * Let students know detailed project information will be given in the async material for Module 15. 

### 14. Office Hours (30 min)

* Announce Office Hours and encourage students to stay on the Zoom and start the challenge while they have live support from instructional staff.
