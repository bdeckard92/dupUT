# Module 14 Virtual Class: Model-View-Controller (MVC)

## Overview

In today's virtual class, students will practice using Handlebars helper functions and partials. Students will also implement sessions using `express-session` and add user authentication to their app using `bcrypt` to hash passwords.

Students will also be assigned to their project groups and go over the project requirements.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Create Handlebars partials to reuse templates

* Implement user sessions using `express-session`

* Implement middleware function in Express.js for user authentication.

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* **Important:** Be sure to modify the `.env.EXAMPLE` file to include your MySQL user and password information before demonstrating each activity.

* Handlebars helper functions are introduced in Lesson 1 and used throughout the module. Handlebars partials were used in Lesson 4, and `express-session` was used in Lesson 2.

* Be prepared to announce project groups and go over the [project requirements](../../01-Class-Content/14-MVC/04-Supplemental/Project-Requirements.md).

## Office Hours

Encourage students to work on the remaining module algorithms during Office Hours. Review the algorithm solutions 5–10 minutes before class begins or during Office Hours after class.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What did you learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

  * 🙋 We learned about Handlebars, which is a template engine, and sessions. We are moving fast compared to traditional learners. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

  * ☝️ Did anyone have an "Aha!" or "Eureka!" moment this week? When was it and why did things suddenly click for you?

  * 🙋 Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we're thinking about it.

  * ☝️ Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

  * 🙋 It's easy to get stuck when you're learning web development. It's important to learn how to get unstuck because it happens to the pros too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the tool's official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups are great because explaining your problems to someone else often reveals the solution.

### 2. Review Current Challenge (5 min)

* Navigate to `01-Class-Content/14-MVC/02-Challenge/Main` from the command line and run `node server.js`

* Open <http://localhost:3001/> and demonstrate the following:

  * You are building a CMS-style blog site where you can write posts.

  * You will need to sign up or sign in in order to access any other links in the navigation.

  * When you click on a post, you can leave a comment. You can also write a new post, update it, or delete it.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What recently acquired skills will help us build this challenge?

  * 🙋 We will use Handlebars to render our views and `express-session` to implement sessions.

  * ☝️ How are these skills relevant to a career in web development?

  * 🙋 User authentication and sessions are critical parts to building secure applications. All employers will want to provide user authentications in their applications.

  * ☝️ How will this challenge improve your portfolio?

  * 🙋 This will demonstrate a firm understanding of template engines and user authentication.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 3. Instructor Demo: Partials (5 min)

* Remind students to start their MySQL server.

* Navigate to `03-Partials/Solved` in your command line and run `npm i` and `npm start`.

* Be sure to rename `.env.EXAMPLE` to `.env` and add your MySQL user and password.

* Remind students how to create the `museum_db` database before continuing.

* Open the browser and go to <http://localhost:3001/> to demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑  Today all the activities will use the museum application.

  * 🔑  We can see four galleries named after the four seasons in different languages.

  * 🔑  When we select a gallery, we see the images that belong in that gallery.

  * 🔑  We can click on an image to view its details.

  * 🔑  The homepage makes use of partials instead of rendering all four galleries at once using one of the built-in Handlebars helpers.

  * 🔑  The partials are getting all their data from the controllers.

Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  ☝️ How else could we use partials in the museum application?

  🙋 We will use partials to reuse a template that renders details about the painting.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Partials (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `03-Partials/README.md`.

  ```md
  # 🏗️ Use Handlebars.js Partials to Reuse a Template

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to be able to render details of a painting by reusing the same Handlebars.js template.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when the details for the paintings associated with the gallery are rendered using a Handlebars.js partial in the [gallery.handlebars](./Unsolved/views/gallery.handlebars) file.

  * It's done when the `painting-details.handlebars` partial renders a card that links to that painting's page.

  * It's done when the card includes a header with the painting's title.

  * It's done when the card includes a body with the painting and the artist's name.

  ## Assets

  The following image demonstrates how the painting's details should be rendered on the page:

  ![On a museum webpage, one card displays a photo of a sandy beach with the title and artist name underneath it.](./Images/01-painting-details.jpg)

  ---

  ## 💡 Hints

  How do we set up the database? What command do we use to seed it? And what is the syntax for Handlebars.js partials?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What are some other ways that we can use Handlebars.js partials? How else can partials be useful?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 5. Instructor Review: Partials (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with Handlebars.js partials? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `painting-details`

  * ✔️ Link to painting's page

  * ✔️ Painting's title

  * ✔️ Painting's image and artist name

* Open `03-Partials/Solved/views/gallery.handlebars` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * This is the gallery page, which displays the paintings that belong to this gallery. There are two to three paintings for each gallery, so we use the built-in helper function `{{#each}}` to iterate through each painting, as shown in the following example:

    ```hbs
    {{#each gallery.paintings as |painting|}}

    {{/each}}
    ```

  * 🔑 The details for each painting will be rendered by using the partial `painting-details`, as follows:

    ```hbs
    {{> painting-details}}
    ```

* Open `03-Partials/Solved/views/partials/painting-details.handlebars` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We are given a card for each painting. We need to include a link to the painting's page, the title, the image, and the artist name.

  * 🔑 We use the entire contents of the card as a link to the painting's page, so we encapsulate everything in a `<a>` tag. We are using the `id` of the painting with the `{{ }}` handlebars syntax, as shown in the following example:

    ```hbs
    <a href="/painting/{{id}}">

    </a>
    ```

  * 🔑 We create the card header by using the `<header>` tag with the painting's `title` as a Handlebars.js expression, like in the following example:

    ```hbs
    <header>{{title}}</header>
    ```

  * 🔑 In the body of the card, we render the actual image of the painting. We use the painting's `filename` in the `<img src>` tag and the painting's `description` as the alt text, as follows:

    ```hbs
    <img src="/images/{{filename}}" alt="{{description}}">
    ```

  * 🔑 Also in the card body, we include the artist's name, as shown in the following example:

    ```hbs
    <p>By: {{artist}}</p>
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where can we specify which data gets sent over to the partials to be rendered?

  * 🙋 That will be handled by the Controller! As part of the MVC framework, the templates (View) only focus on the rendering of content. The routes (Controller) are responsible for getting the data from the database (Model) and handle all the logic behind which data needs to be rendered.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [Handlebars.js documentation on basic partials](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/partials.html#basic-partials), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Sessions  (5 min)

* Navigate to `04-Sessions/Solved` in your command line and run `npm i` and `npm start`.

* Be sure to rename the `.env.EXAMPLE` file to `.env` and fill the missing values.

* This activity also makes use of seed data, unlike the previous activities. To seed the database, run `npm run seed`.

* Run `npm start`, open <http://localhost:3001/> in your browser, and demonstrate the following:

  * Sessions allow the Express.js server to handle multiple requests in parallel. They also keep track of the current user's session.

  * We keep track of the user's login status by using the `express-session` module. This will allow us to leverage sessions in the Express.js routes.

  * Notice that when we visit the page initially we are restricted to viewing a few images and some basic information about gallery hours.

  * We can however, create an account and have access to some authenticated functionality of the app.

  * After we log in, our session will be stored in the browser, and we will be able to see more images and more information.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `04-Sessions/README.me`.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How could we use sessions to allow or restrict access to content?

  * 🙋 We could use sessions to check whether a user is logged in or not, then allow logged-in users to access the gallery's paintings. Otherwise we could redirect users to the login page.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Sessions  (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Sessions/README.md`.

  ```md
  # 📐 Add Comments to Sessions in the Login Route

  Work with a partner to add comments describing the functionality of the code found in [home-routes.js](./Unsolved/controllers/home-routes.js) and [painting.handlebars](./Unsolved/views/painting.handlebars).

  ## 📝 Notes

  Refer to the documentation: express-session [documentation](http://expressjs.com/en/advanced/best-practice-security.html#use-cookies-securely)

  * Visitors are able to view gallery's paintings after they login.

  * Visitors are able to maintain a session between visits to the site.

  * To test the routes, feel free to either create your own user or use the following credentials:

    * `username`: "Sam"
    
    * `email`: "sam@email.com"
    
    * `password`: "password1234"

  * If the session variables are set up when the user is created or logged in, which file would hold that info?

  * How can the templates know if the user is logged in or not?

  * What built-in helper method will help us render specific content depending on whether the user is logged in or not?

  ---

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What is the lifecycle of a session?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 8. Instructor Review: Sessions  (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with sessions? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `loggedIn` session variable

  * ✔️ `{{#if loggedIn}}`

  * ✔️ `{{else}}`

* Open `04-Sessions/Solved/controllers/api/user-routes.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We have been provided with `user-routes` to handle functionality for creating a new user, logging in, and logging out.

  * 🔑 We want new users to be logged in right away. So we set up a session variable `loggedIn` and set it to `true` as soon a user is created, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    req.session.save(() => {
      req.session.loggedIn = true;
      res.status(200).json(dbUserData);
    });
    ```

  * 🔑 For the `/login` route, after we find the user in the database, using their email address, and check their password against the hashed password, we set up the session, like in the following example:

    ```js
    req.session.save(() => {
      req.session.loggedIn = true;
      res
        .status(200)
        .json({ user: dbUserData, message: 'You are now logged in!' });
    });
    ```

  * Notice how we destroy the session once the user logs out, as follows:

    ```js
    router.post('/logout', (req, res) => {
      if (req.session.loggedIn) {
        req.session.destroy(() => {
          res.status(204).end();
        });
      } else {
        res.status(404).end();
      }
    });
    ```

* Open `04-Sessions/Solved/views/gallery.handlebars` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We want to prevent unauthorized access to the paintings in the gallery page. So on the `gallery.handlebars` template, we use the built-in helper method `{{#if}}` to determine whether the session variable `loggedIn` is set to `true`. Only then can they access the `painting-details`. See the following code for an example:

    ```handlebars
    {{#if loggedIn}}
      <section class="flex-row justify-center">
        {{#each gallery.paintings as |painting|}}
        {{> painting-details}}
        {{/each}}
      </section>
    </section>
    ```

  * 🔑 Else, if the session variable `loggedIn` does not exist or is set to `false`, then we provide a link for them to log in, as shown in the following example:

    ```handlebars
    {{else}}
    <a href="/login">You must log in first to view the paintings</a>
    {{/if}}
    ```

* Open `04-Sessions/Solved/views/painting.handlebars` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We need to do the same thing to the `painting.handlebars` template to restrict access.

  * Here we wrap the entire contents of the template in the `{{#if}}` helper method, as follows:

    ```handlebars
    {{#if loggedIn}}
    <section class="painting">
      ...
    </section>
    {{else}}
    <a href="/login">You must log in first to view this painting</a>
    {{/if}}
    ```

* Run `npm start` and navigate to <http://localhost:3001/> in your browser to demonstrate the following:

  * If we try to access the paintings without logging in, we are directed to log in first.

  * Let's create a user using the provided credentials:

    * `username`: "Sam"
  
    * `email`: "sam@email.com"
  
    * `password`: "password1234"

  * After we are logged in, we can access everything on the museum website.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Did you notice where else we used the `loggedIn` session variable to change the view?

  * 🙋 On the `main.handlebars` template, once the user logged in, the login link was replaced by a logout button in the navbar!

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [npm documentation on express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Instructor Demo: Middleware  (5 min)

* Navigate to `05-Middleware/Solved` in your command line and run `npm i` and `npm start`.

  * 🔑 Conditional access refers to only allowing authorized users to see certain content. We did something like this already, when we checked whether the user was logged in before allowing them to see the paintings. But we checked that in the templates.

  * 🔑 In line with the separation of concerns principle and the MVC framework, the correct way to accomplish this is directly in the routes.

  * 🔑  One way we can accomplish this is again to use a session variable for the logged in status, and then use that session variable to determine whether what the user is able to view.

  * 🔑  We can apply this logic to the gallery and painting routes, as it is much more efficient than checking the session variable in the templates.

  * 🔑  We will be creating a middleware function that will be used in the routes to determine whether the user is logged in or not in this activity.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What is a middleware?

  * 🙋 Middleware is a function that is called before a route is executed.

  * ☝️ How could we use custom in the museum application?

  * 🙋 We can use middleware to restrict access to certain routes by checking the session variable to determine whether the user is logged in or not.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 10. Student Do: Middleware  (20 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `05-Middleware/README.md`.

```md
# 📖 Implement Middleware Function for User Authentication

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to write my own middleware to check for user authentication.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the middleware checks whether the user is logged in.

* It's done when the middleware allows access to the gallery and painting pages if the user is logged in.

* It's done when the middleware directs an unauthorized user to the login page if they are not logged in yet.

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation:

[Express.js documentation on using middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html)

---

## 💡 Hints

How can you keep the current logic being used in the routes to check whether a user is logged in or not? Could this be rewritten as a middleware function? 

Where can you write the code for the custom middleware so that it is separate but accessible from the routes? (Where did you put the custom helper functions?)

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What other middleware do developers use with Express.js?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
```

### 11. Instructor Review: Middleware  (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with custom middleware? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `withAuth`

* Open `05-Middleware/Solved/utils/auth.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * According to the Express.js documentation, middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object `req`, the response object `res`, and the next middleware function `next`. If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call `next()` to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.

  * To create the custom middleware, we put it in the same folder as the custom helper functions: the `/utils` folder. We create a new file called `auth.js` to hold the custom middleware.

  * 🔑 So to create this custom middleware, `withAuth`, we take the same logic that was in the routes and put it in the function, as follows:

    ```js
    const withAuth = (req, res, next) => {
      // This is directly from the `/gallery/:id` and `/painting/:id` routes
      if (!req.session.loggedIn) {
        res.redirect('/login');
      } else {
        // We call next() if the user is authenticated
        next();
      }
    };

    module.exports = withAuth;
    ```

* Open `05-Middleware/Solved/controllers/home-routes.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * Now we need to refactor the routes to use the middleware functions.

  * First we need to import the custom middleware at the top of the file, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    const withAuth = require('../utils/auth');
    ```

  * 🔑 Then we replace the logic that is in the `/gallery/:id` and `/painting/:id` routes with the middleware, as follows:

    ```js
    router.get('/gallery/:id', withAuth, async (req, res) => { 

    }

    router.get('/painting/:id', withAuth, async (req, res) => {

    }
    ```

  * Notice how clean the code looks&mdash;and it functions perfectly!

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How can custom middleware be useful when building applications?

  * 🙋 Custom middleware can help handle common functionality in applications. For example, it keeps us from repeating the same code at the beginning of a route handler.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [Express.js documentation on using middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before ending the class.

### 12. Recap & Promote Additional Resources (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What do you think you absolutely need to know to succeed at the challenge?

  * 🙋 You will need to know Handlebars and `express-session` to build your full-stack blog application.

  * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

  * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it is not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful.

  * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material prior to class as possible?

  * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer.

* Direct students to the additional resources available to them:

  * Reflection and Retrieval

  * Career Connection

  * Dessert Menu

### 13. Introduce Group Project (5 min)

* Announce the project groups.

  * Encourage the groups to set up a time this weekend to brainstorm project ideas.

  * Project ideas will be approved by the instructor by next week's first virtual class in Module 15.

* Go over project requirements.

  * Add the [project requirements](../../01-Class-Content/14-MVC/04-Supplemental/Project-Requirements.md) to the student-facing repo and go over them briefly.

    ```md
    # Project Requirements

    * Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API

    * Use a template engine, such as Handlebars.js

    * Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database
