# Module 14 Virtual Class (Required): MVC

## Overview 

In today's required virtual class, students will practice using Handlebars helper functions and partials. Students will also implement sessions using `express-session`.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Utilize the Handlebars `{{#each}}`, `{{#if}}`, `{{#unless}}` helper functions

* Create Handlebars partials to reuse templates

* Implement user sessions using `express-session`


## Instructor Notes 

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* Instead of setting up a MySQL database for these activities, students will be given dummy data to use. 

* Although we just finished learning Sequelize, these activities only use Express so students can focus simply on Handlebars and `express-session`.

* Handlebars helper functions are introduced in Lesson 1 and used throughout the module. Handlebars partials were used in Lesson 4, and `express-session` was used in Lesson 2.


## Office Hours

Encourage students to work on the remaining module algorithms during Office Hours. Review the algorithm solutions 5–10 minutes before class begins or during Office Hours after class.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What did you learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

    * 🙋 We learned about Handlebars, which is a template engine, and sessions. We are moving fast compared to traditional learners. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ Did anyone have an "Aha!" or "Eureka!" moment this week? When was it and why did things suddenly click for you? 

    * 🙋 Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we're thinking about it.

    * ☝️ Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

    * 🙋 It's easy to get stuck when you're learning web development. It's important to learn how to get unstuck because it happens to the pros too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the tool's official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups are great because explaining your problems to someone else often reveals the solution. 


### 2. Review Current Challenge (5 min)

@TODO USE THE FOLLOWING FOR BROWSER AND/OR COMMAND LINE DEMOS, RESPECTIVELY. REMOVE IF UNUSED
* Open `@TODO/folder/file` in your browser and demonstrate the following:
* Run `@TODO/folder/file { AND ARGS, IF ANY }` from the command line and demonstrate the following: 

    * @TODO { WHEN WE DO THIS, IT DOES THAT. }

    * @TODO { WE ALSO SEE THESE THINGS. }

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What recently acquired skills will help us build this challenge?

    * 🙋 @TODO { YES, WHAT? }

    * ☝️ How are these skills relevant to a career in web development?

    * 🙋 @TODO { YES, WHAT? }

    * ☝️ How will this challenge improve your portfolio?

    * 🙋 @TODO { YES, HOW? }

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 3. Instructor Demo: Library Books (5 min) 

* Navigate to `03-Library-Books/Solved` in your command line and run `npm start`.

* Open the browser and go to `localhost:3001` to demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 We see the following details about each book: `title`, `author`, and `read` status. 

    * 🔑 We see two lists of books depending on whether they've been read or not. 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used Handlebars to render the details of a post in Lesson 1. We also used Handlebars helper functions in Lesson 1 to loop through the posts of the CMS.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We will need to use Handlebars and its helper functions to iterate through data and render them to the page. 

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We would need to send the books array as an object to the `index.handlebars` file and use the helper functions to iterate through the books and render their details in two lists according to the `read` status.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 4. Student Do: Library Books  (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `03-Library-Books/README.md`.

```md
# Library Books

In this activity, you will use Handlebars built-in helpers to render details about library books.

## Instructions

* Navigate to the [Unsolved](Unsolved/) folder and run `npm install` in your terminal.

* Open the [server.js](Unsolved/server.js) file and do the following:

  * Set Handlebars as the default template engine.

  * For simplicity, do not use MySQL or Sequelize for this activity. Use the given `books` array as your dummy data. 

  * Modify the `/` route so that all the books are sent to the `index.handlebars` file. 

    * Remember, Handlebars requires an object to be sent to the `index.handlebars` file, not an array!

* In the [Unsolved/views/index.handlebars](Unsolved/views/index.handlebars) file, loop through the books sent to this page.

  * For `{{#each}}` of the books, check `{{#if}}` the book has been read using the appropriate helper functions.

  * In an unordered list, print out the details of the books in the correct list.

* To test if everything is working properly, run `npm start` in your terminal and navigate to `localhost:3001` in your browser. 

  * You should be able to see all of the books listed according to their `read` status.

## Hint(s)

* You may need to consult the [Express Handlebars Helpers docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars#helpers) on how to use the build-in helpers. 
```

### 5. Instructor Review: Library Books  (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ Set up Handlebars

    * ✔️ `/` route

    * ✔️ `{{#each}}`
    
    * ✔️ `{{#if}}`
    
    * ✔️ `{{#unless}}`

* Open `03-Library-Books/Solved/server.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 First, we set up Handlbars as the default template engine.

    ```js
    app.engine('handlebars', exphbs({ defaultLayout: 'main' }));
    app.set('view engine', 'handlebars');
    ```
    
    * 🔑 In the `/` route, we need to create an object of the books array to send over to the `index.handlebars` file. 

    ```js
    app.get('/', (req, res) => {
      // Send the books to index.handlebars as an object
      const data = {
        library: books
      };
      res.render('index', data);
    });
    ```

* Open `03-Library-Books/Solved/views/index.handlebars` in your IDE and explain the following:

    * Using a combination of HTML and Handlebars, we need to create a template that will print out the details of each book that is sent to this page.

    * 🔑 First we need to go through `{{#each}}` book that has been sent over.

    * 🔑 For the first list, we only want the books that have been read. We use the `{{#if}}` helper method to check each of the book's `read` value to see if it is set to `true`.

    * Then we print out the details of only those books:

    ```handlebars
    <ul>
      {{#each library}}
      {{#if read}}
      <li>
        <p>Title: {{title}}</p>
        <p>Author: {{author}}</p>
        <p>Read: {{read}}</p>
      </li>
      {{/if}}
      {{/each}}
    </ul>
    ```

    * 🔑 For the second list, we only want the books that have not been read yet. We use the `{{#unless}}` helper method as the inverse of the `{{#if}}` helper. Its block will be rendered only if the `read` status is `false`. 

    ```handlebars
    <ul>
      {{#each library}}
      {{#unless read}}
      <li>
        <p>Title: {{title}}</p>
        <p>Author: {{author}}</p>
        <p>Read: {{read}}</p>
      </li>
      {{/unless}}
      {{/each}}
    </ul>
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How are Handlebars helper functions helpful?

    * 🙋 The `{{#if}}`, `{{#unless}}`, `{{#each}}`, and `{{#with}}` helpers are all useful in rendering only the details that are needed onto the page. Helpers are the place where this kind of logic is defined. 

    * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [Handlebars Build-in Helpers docs](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/builtin-helpers.html), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 6. Instructor Demo: Read Books  (5 min) 

* Navigate to `04-Read-Books/Solved` in your command line and run `npm start`.

* Open the browser and go to `localhost:3001` to demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 We see the same two lists of books as the last activity. The only difference is that this page has been rendered through the use of Handlebars partials. 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 We used Handlebars partials for the comments of the posts in Lesson 4.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We will use Handlebars partials for any HTML code that will be repeated or reused in our application.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We need to take the HTML code for printing out the details of each book and put it in a Handlebars partial file.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 7. Student Do: Read Books  (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Read-Books/README.md`.

```md
# Read Books

In this activity, you will use Handlebars partials to reuse the template that displays the book details.

## Instructions

* Navigate to the [Unsolved](Unsolved/) folder and run `npm install` in your terminal.

* Create a folder called `partials` inside the `views` folder.

* Inside the `partials` folder, create another folder called `books`.

* Inside the `books` folder, create a Handlebars partial file called `book-block.handlebars`. 

  * Write the code for printing out the book details for each book (`title`, `author`, `read`).

* Open the [index.handlebars](Unsolved/views/index.handlebars) file and do the following:

  * Replace the code that renders the book details with Handlebars partial file you created above.

* To test if everything is working properly, run `npm start` in your terminal and navigate to `localhost:3001` in your browser. 

  * You should be able to see all of the books listed according to their `read` status.

## Hint(s)

* You may need to consult the [Handlebars Partials docs](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/partials.html#basic-partials) on how to use partials. 
```

### 8. Instructor Review: Read Books  (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ `book-block.handlebars` file

    * ✔️ `{{> books/book-block}}`

* Open `04-Read-Books/Solved/views/partials/books/book-block.handlebars` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * Make sure students created the folder structure correctly, `Unsolved/views/partials/books/`

    * 🔑 Copy and paste the code for printing out the details of the book from the `index.handlebars` file into this `book-block.handlebars` file.

    ```handlebars
    <li>
      <p>Title: {{title}}</p>
      <p>Author: {{author}}</p>
      <p>Read: {{read}}</p>
