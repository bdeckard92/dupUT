# Module 14 Virtual Class (Recommended): MVC

## Overview 

In today's recommended virtual class, students will { @TODO OUTLINE THE CAREER CONNECTION TOPIC } and practice using Handlebars.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* @TODO { CAREER CONNECTION }

* Render pages using Handlebars

* Utilize Handlebars helpers to iterate through objects and render them on to the page. 


## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* Instead of setting up a MySQL database for these activities, students will be given dummy data to use. 

* Although we just finished learning Sequelize, these activities only use Express so students can focus simply on Handlebars.

* @TODO { REFERENCE TO ASYNC }

## Class Instructions 

### 1. Introduction (5 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Direct students to post individual questions in the Zoom chat to be addressed by TAs and/or at the end of class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

    * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back and see what we accomplished, and acknowledge that it's a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic? 

    * 🙋 Let's do "fist to five" together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).


### 2. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

@TODO CHECK WITH THE LCA, LCE & CS POC


### 3. Instructor Demo: Ben and Jerry's (5 min) 

* Navigate to `01-Ben-and-Jerrys/Solved/` in your command line and run `npm start`.

* Open the browser and go to `localhost:3001` to demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 We can see a list of Ben and Jerry's ice cream flavors.

    * 🔑 If we want to see additional information about a specific ice cream flavor, edit the URL with the number of that flavor, i.e. `localhost:3001/1`

    * 🔑 We can see the name of the ice cream, the price, and the level of awesomeness. 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 @TODO We used this to accomplish { X, Y, Z }, in { CORRESPONDING ASYNCHRONOUS LESSON PLAN }.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 We will need to use Handlebars to render the views of our application. 

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We need to use Handlebars with Express to create a route to view the details of specific ice cream flavors. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 4. Student Do: Ben and Jerry's (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-Ben-and-Jerrys/README.md`.

    ```md
    # Ben and Jerry's 

    In this activity, you will use Handlebars to render details about specific Ben and Jerry's ice cream flavors. 

    ## Instructions

    * Navigate to the [Unsolved](Unsolved/) folder and run `npm install` in your terminal.

    * Open the [server.js](Unsolved/server.js) file and do the following:

      * Set Handlebars as the default templating engine.

      * For simplicity, do not use MySQL or Sequelize for this activity. Add the `icecreams` array below as your dummy data:

    ```js
    const icecreams = [
        {name: 'Milk and Cookies', price: 10, awesomeness: 3},
        {name: 'Chocolate Peanut Butter Split', price: 4, awesomeness: 8},
        {name: 'Bourbon Pecan Pie', price: 1, awesomeness: 1},
        {name: 'Chubby Hubby', price: 5, awesomeness: 7},
        {name: 'Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch', price: 6, awesomeness: 2},
        {name: "Ice Cream Sammie", price: 11, awesomeness: 15 }
    ]
    ```

      * Using Handlebars and Express, create a route called `/:num`.

        * When the route is hit, it will display the name, price and awesomeness for that specific ice cream.

        * Look at how [all.handlebars](Unsolved/views/all.handlebars) is hard-coded in order to render the right ice cream.

    * In the [Unsolved/views](Unsolved/views/) folder, create a new Handlebars file called `icecream.handlebars`.

    * Create a template that will print out the name, price and awesomeness for that specific ice cream.

    ## Hint(s)

    * You may need to consult the [Express Handlebars docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars#usage) for its usage.
    ```

### 5. Instructor Review: Ben and Jerry's (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ Set up Handlebars

    * ✔️ Create route `/:num`

    * ✔️ `icecream.handlebars` file

* Open `01-Ben-and-Jerrys/Solved/server.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 First, we set up Handlebars as the default templating engine.

    ```js
    app.engine('handlebars', exphbs({ defaultLayout: 'main' }));
    app.set('view engine', 'handlebars');
    ```

    * Next, make sure the students added the dummy data `icecreams` to their `server.js` file

    ```js
    const icecreams = [
      { name: 'Milk and Cookies', price: 10, awesomeness: 3 },
      { name: 'Chocolate Peanut Butter Split', price: 4, awesomeness: 8 },
      { name: 'Bourbon Pecan Pie', price: 1, awesomeness: 1 },
      { name: 'Chubby Hubby', price: 5, awesomeness: 7 },
      { name: 'Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch', price: 6, awesomeness: 2 },
      { name: 'Ice Cream Sammie', price: 11, awesomeness: 15 }
    ];
    ```

    * The route to get the list of ice cream flavors is given. `all.handlebars` is hard-coded for our activity purposes.

    * 🔑 We need to create a route that will display the details for a specific ice cream flavor.

    * We get the number from the `req.params.num` but we need to subtract 1

    ```js
    app.get('/:num', (req, res) => {
      return res.render('icecream', icecreams[req.params.num - 1]);
    });
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ @TODO { DO WE END OUR REVIEWS WITH A QUESTION? }

    * 🙋 @TODO { YES, WE DO! }

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 @TODO We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [{ DOCS }]({ URL }), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 6. Instructor Demo: { ACTIVITY NAME } (5 min) 

@TODO USE THE FOLLOWING FOR BROWSER AND/OR COMMAND LINE DEMOS, RESPECTIVELY. REMOVE IF UNUSED
* Open `@TODO/folder/file` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 @TODO { WHEN WE DO THIS, IT DOES THAT. }

    * 🔑 @TODO { WE ALSO SEE THESE THINGS. }

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

```md
    @TODO ADD INSTRUCTIONS; TABBED
```


### 8. Instructor Review: { ACTIVITY NAME } (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ @TODO { THIS }

### 09. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

    * 🙋 @TODO { YES, WHAT? }

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful. 

    * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

    * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer. 

    * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

    * 🙋 @TODO { YES, WHERE? }

    * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Use student answers to transition to Office Hours.


### 10. Office Hours (30 min)

* Announce Office Hours and invite students to stay on the Zoom and start the challenge while they have live support from instructional staff.
