## Class Instructions 

### 1. Introduction (5 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Direct students to post individual questions in the Zoom chat to be addressed by TAs and/or at the end of class.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è How are you feeling about your progress so far?

    * üôã We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back and see what we accomplished, and acknowledge that it's a lot! It‚Äôs also okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don‚Äôt give up.

    * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with this topic? 

    * üôã Let's do "fist to five" together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).


### 2. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)


* This week students were introduced to the MVC paradigm and spent time building servers and clients using the Handlebars.js library. It's likely you'll have a number of students who didn't jibe with it, and don't see its usefulness if we are going to be moving on to React.

* Take time to remind students that MVC is insanely popular, and that templating engines are used by many different programming languages. In this week's async Career Connection in Canvas, students were introduced to Thymeleaf for Java, Razor for C#, Jinja for Python and Blade for Laravel. So they should have an idea of different templating frameworks.

* Take a minute to review what they covered, ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã)::

    * ‚òùÔ∏èWhat other languages use templating languages? 

    * üôãEssentially all of them! 

    * ‚òùÔ∏èWhy is templating so important?

    * üôãIt's a tried and tested way of creating full-stack web applications and used by many web application development languages such as Java, C#, and Python.


* Once you've finished a brief discussion on the importance of MVC and templating, move on to discuss this week's CodeSignal algorithm:

    * ‚òùÔ∏è Did anyone attempt the Code Signal algorithm?

    * üôã It is encouraged to take advantage of the CodeSignal practice because it reflects real-world online interviewing.

* Open your IDE and review the solution to the CodeSignal algorithm:


    * The algorithm is called 'fizzBuzzPlusPlus', which is the same as a variation on a common algorithm tested by employers called just `fizzBuzz`, with which they may alreay be familiar.

    * In this algorith challenge, consider the original FizzBuzz challenge (replacing any integer in an array divisible by 3 with `Fizz`, anything divisible by 5 with `Buzz` and anything divisible by 3 and 5 with `FizzBuzz`). 

    * Take an input number, like 15, for example, all the natural numbers that are also multiples of 3 or 5 are 3, 5, 6, 9, 12. The sum of these numbers is 35.

    * Write a function that completes the solution so that it returns the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 _below_ the number passed in as a parameter. 

    * The instructions provide the following details regarding input and output:

    ```
    [execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)

    [input] integer num

    [output] integer
    ```

* We are also provided the following starter code:

```js
function fizzbuzzPlusPlus(num) {

}
```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òù) and call on students for answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è There are myriad ways to solve for this. What do we know we are going to need in order to solve this problem? 

    * üôã We will need two holder variables, one as an array that will hold all the numbers that are multiples of 3 or 5 and less than the input `num`, as well as a variable that holds the sum of these numbers.

    ```js
    let numArray = [];
    let sum = 0;
    ```

    * ‚òùÔ∏èExcellent. Great start. So how do we grab all the numbers that are multiples of 3 or 5 and less than `num`?

    * üôã Just use a `for loop`!

    ```js
    for (var i = 0; i < num; i++) {

        // check if the number is a multiple of 3 and 5
        if (i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0) {

            // if so, push it to our array
            numArray.push(i);

            // check if the number is a multiple of 3
        } else if (i % 3 === 0) {

            // if so, push it to our array
            numArray.push(i);

            // check if the number is a multiple of 5
        } else if (i % 5 === 0) {

            // if so, push it to our array
            numArray.push(i);
        }
    }
    ```

    * ‚òùÔ∏èThat'll work nicely. So once we've done that, we'll need to get the sum of all numbers in our new array. How did you achieve that?

    * üôãUse another for loop to cycle through that array and add them into `sum`:

    ```js
    for (var i = 0; i < numArray.length; i++) {
            sum = sum + numArray[i];
        }
    ```
    
    * ‚òùÔ∏èIndeed! Great! And just don't forget to `return` sum at the end. But how could we shorten this? One option is to swap out our for loop and return statement for JavaScript's `.reduce()` method like this:

    ```
    return numArray.reduce((a, b) => a + b);
    ```

* Answer any questions students have before moving to the next activity.

* Full solution:
```js
function fizzbuzzPlusPlus(num) {
    var numArray = [];
    var sum = 0;

    for (var i = 0; i < num; i++) {
        if (i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0) {
            numArray.push(i);
        } else if (i % 3 === 0) {
            numArray.push(i);
        } else if (i % 5 === 0) {
            numArray.push(i);
        }
    }

    return numArray.reduce((a, b) => a + b);

    // for (var i = 0; i < numArray.length; i++) {
    //     sum = sum + numArray[i];
    // }
}
```

    * ‚òùÔ∏è Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

    * üôã It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer. 

    * ‚òùÔ∏è Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

    * üôã @TODO { YES, WHERE? }

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Use student answers to transition to Office Hours.


### 10. Office Hours (30 min)

* Announce Office Hours and invite students to stay on the Zoom and start the challenge while they have live support from instructional staff.
