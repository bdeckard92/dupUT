# Module 17 Virtual Class: Computer Science for JavaScript

## Overview 

In today's virtual class, students will practice computer science fundamentals as they apply to JavaScript using closures and callback queues.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Identify lexical scope and use closures

* Describe the function of the callback queue

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* Closures are introduced in Lesson 2 and callback queues are introduced in Lesson 1.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Invite students to post questions in the Zoom chat so TAs and/or the instructor can address them at the end of class.

* Open the lesson's [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1udd8RlVgxsmPjt2ugzIgvVF1zFClwfD1hWzeyvtQbr8/edit?usp=sharing) and walk through the following slides on foundation setting: 

   **Big Picture**: This is an opportunity to look at the big picture of where students are in the course. Take a moment to discuss a few real-world examples of why this week's topics are valuable.

   **Boot Camp Pointers**: Review some logistics that will help students stay on track. This is an opportunity to speak to what students might need at this particular point in the course. 

   **This Week**: Review the key skills students will be learning this week.

   **This Week's Assignment**: Give a quick summary of this week's Challenge assignment and describe how the skills they learn throughout the week will be applied to it.

   **Career Connection**: Reinforce that students will use the skills they learn this week throughout their careers. It's important for them to know the "why" and "how" behind the "what." Give examples of how these skills are used on the job. If you feel comfortable, share examples of how you have used them in your professional career.

   * Let students know that Computer Science for JavaScript is perhaps one of the most important weeks for boot camp students as they relate to technical interviews.

    * Let students know that while algorithms and data structures are often used to test prospective candidates prior to making a job offer.

    * Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

        * ☝ Why are algorithms so frequently used in technical interviewing?

        * 🙋 Algorithms are domain neutral, which means you can use them to test candidates from various backgrounds, whether they traditionally work in back-end, front-end, security, DevOps, or other roles. They are also foundational to seeing how candidates try to solve problems.

    * Essentially, as developers, our job is to solve problems. Asking a candidate to solve, or try to solve, an algorithm is a great indicator of how that person will try to solve problems on the job. It often doesn't matter whether the answer is correct, but HOW a candidate goes about trying to solve something they don't know. 

    * Let students know that it can be frustrating to have to be able to solve algorithms to get a job. We spend the majority of the time in class learning how to develop applications—which is what students will do once they get that job. 

    * If possible, share some of your experiences with technical interviewing and having to solve algorithms. 

    * Encourage students to practice solving algorithms as often as possible using sites such as [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/), [CodeSignal](https://codesignal.com/), and others.

   **How to Succeed This Week**: Remind students that they might experience moments of frustration as they learn complex concepts and tools, and that these times are actually proven opportunities to deepen knowledge. Consider sharing something about your personal learning journey. This helps students recognize that everyone starts somewhere and that they are not alone.

   **Today's Objectives**: Outline the concepts that will be covered in today's lesson. Remind students that they can find the relevant activity files in the "Getting Ready for Class" page in their course content. 

### 2. Instructor Do: Student Check-In (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

  * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back at what we've accomplished and acknowledge that it is a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed&mdash;as long as you don’t give up.

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic?

  * 🙋 Let's do Fist to Five together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 3. Instructor Demo: Closures (5 min)

* Open `01-Closures/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We first create a function named `counter`, which will be the outer function and create a closure around the soon-to-exist inner function. Inside this outer function, we place a variable, called `count`:

    ```js
    function counter() {
      let count = 0;
    }
    ```
  
  * 🔑 Next we add an inner function named `increment` and return it. The inner function now exists within the closure and is lexically bound to the outer function.

    ```js
    return {
      increment: function () {
        return ++count;
      },
    };
    ```

* Navigate to `01-Console/index.html` in the browser and open Chrome DevTool's console:

  * 🔑 To check out how lexical binding works, we enter `console.dir()` in the console to display a list of the method's properties, including the scope.

    ```js
    console.dir(counter());
    ```

  * 🔑 When we inspect the scope of the `counter()` method object, we see that it has a closure that references outer function's `count` variable. This is because in JavaScript, an inner function is lexically bound to the outer function and has access to the outer function's variables. This is called lexical scoping.

    ```text
    Object
      increment: ƒ ()
        arguments: null
        caller: null
        length: 0
        name: "increment"
        prototype: {constructor: ƒ}
        [[FunctionLocation]]: index.js:7
        [[Prototype]]: ƒ ()
        [[Scopes]]: Scopes[2]
          0: Closure (counter) {count: 0}
          1: Global {0: global, window: Window, self: Window, document: document, name: '', location: Location, …}
    ```

  * 🔑 We also notice the function belongs to the global scope. However, when we go outside of the closure by logging the `count` variable in the console, the variable is undefined. That is because a variable declared in closure is bound to the closure -- or private -- and is not available outside of its lexical scope.

    ```js
    console.log(count);
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 In Lesson 2, we went over an example where we used closures to increment the `count` variable. 

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

    * 🙋 Closures have developed an infamous reputation for being a difficult screening question in interviews. Although the Challenge is about creating a tutorial specifically on regex, being able to explain and clearly communicate difficult topics, such as closures, will help you with the Challenge. 

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We need to use a closure in order to access the `count` variable in the lexical scope.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Closures (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-Closures/README.md`, which is also shown here:

    ```md
    # 📖 Create a Counter Function That Uses a Private Variable

    Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

    * As a teacher, I want a way to keep track of the number of students I see every day.

    * As a developer, I want to keep my `count` variable data private.

    ## Acceptance Criteria

    * It's done when the `Counter` function correctly increments by 1.

    * It's done when I can only access the `count` variable from within the `Counter` function.

    * It's done when all of the unit tests pass when I enter `npm install` and `npm test` in the terminal.

    ## 📝 Notes

    Refer to the documentation:

    [MDN web docs on closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures)

    ## 🏆 Bonus

    If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

    * What is dynamic scoping? How is it different than lexical scoping?

    Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this. 
    ```

### 5. Instructor Review: Closures (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points () below to review the following key points (✔️):

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with closures? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ Closures

  * ✔️ Private variables

  * ✔️ Lexical environment

* Open `14-Stu_Closures/Solved/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 By creating the function `counter`, we have also created a closure.

    ```js
    function counter() {
      // Code...
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 Inside the outer function, we create a private `count` variable that will hold the number of times the function is called.

    ```js
    function counter() {

      let count = 0;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 Next, we use the closure by returning an object by using the `increment` method, which increases the `count` by one.

    ```js
    function counter() {
    
      let count = 0;

      return {

        increment: function () {
        
          return ++count;
        },
      };
    }
    ```

  * If we type `npm test` in the command line, we should see the following:

    ```bash
      PASS  __tests__/index.test.js
      √ counter is a defined function (2 ms)
      √ counter is returning as an object
      √ count should equal 0 (1 ms)
      √ count should equal 1
      √ count should equal 4

    Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
    Tests:       5 passed, 5 total
    Snapshots:   0 total
    Time:        1.974 s
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How else could we use closures?

    * 🙋 We could conceal sensitive variables that shouldn't be mutated outside of the function's scope.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 2, read the [MDN Web Docs on Closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures), and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Event Delegation (5 min) 

* Open `02-Event-Delegation/Solved/index.html` in your browser to demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 We see a list of fruits, each with a button "Add to Cart"

    * 🔑 When we click on the button, that item is added to the "Shopping Cart" list below.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 In Lesson 2, we delegated events using closures by attaching the event listener to the common parent element of a list of buttons. 

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

    * 🙋 Similar to the closures activity, although event delegation is not directly related to the Challenge, understanding how it works and being able to explain it clearly will help you succeed at interviews.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We need to create an event listener that will listen for a "click" of any of the buttons in the fruits list and append the name of the clicked fruit to the shopping cart list.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Event Delegation (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Event-Delegation/README.md`, which are also shown here:

     ```md
     # Event Delegation

     In this activity, you will use event delegation to listen for "clicks" on multiple items in order to add them to your shopping cart.

     ## Instructions

     * Open [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) and examine the code. 

     * Open [script.js](Unsolved/script.js) and do the following:

     * Create an event listener on the common parent element of the fruits. You can refer to `index.html` as needed.

     * When a button is clicked, create a `div` that will hold the name of the fruit and append it to the `#shopping-cart`.
    
     ## Hint(s)

     * In order to get the name of the fruit, notice what unique identifier you can use from the `#grocery-list`.
     ```

### 8. Instructor Review: Event Delegation (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points (:key:) below to review the following key points (✔️):

    * ✔️ `addEventListener()`

    * ✔️ `event.target.matches('button')`

    * ✔️ `event.target.parentElement.id`

* Open `02-Event-Delegation/Solved/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * We see all of the variables we will need already created for us on top.

         ```js
         const listEl = document.querySelector('#grocery-list');
         const shoppingCartEl = document.querySelector('#shopping-cart');
         const fruits = ['Bananas', 'Apples', 'Oranges', 'Grapes', 'Blueberries'];
         ```

    * 🔑 We need to create an event listener on the parent element of the fruits, which is `#grocery-list` assigned to `listEl`.

         ```js
         listEl.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
             event.preventDefault();
         ```

    * 🔑 Then, within the callback, we determine whether the clicked item was a button or not by using `event.target.matches('button')`. This technique is known as event delegation. Instead of writing a `for` loop and adding event listeners to every button element, we added an event listener to its parent element `#grocery-list`. 

         ```js
         if (event.target.matches('button')) {
         ```

    * Once we determine that a button was clicked, we create a `div` element to contain the name of the fruit clicked.

         ```js
         const item = document.createElement('div');
         ```

    * To identify which fruit was clicked, we use `event.target.parentElement.id` to grab the `id` of the list item where the click happened. Then we use that `id` number to find the corresponding fruit from the `fruits` array. We assign it to `item.textContent`

         ```js
         item.textContent = fruits[event.target.parentElement.id];
         ```

    * Finally, we append the `item` to the `#shopping-cart` div.

         ```js
         shoppingCartEl.append(item);
         ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How does using event delegation simplify your code? 

    * 🙋 Event delegation allows you to avoid adding event listeners to specific nodes;  instead, the event listener is added to one parent.  That event listener analyzes bubbled events to find a match on child elements.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 2, read the [MDN Web Docs on events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events), and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

    * 🙋 We learned about the usefulness of closures and event delegation. 

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful. 

    * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

    * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the Challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer. 

    * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

    * 🙋 Closures and event delegation were covered in Lesson 2.

    * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Use student answers to transition to Office Hours.

### 10. Challenge Review (30 min)

* Take this time to help get students unblocked on any Challenges that they are working through.

* Expect that students may ask for the following:

  * Further review on a particular subject

  * Debugging assistance

  * Help with computer issues

  * Guidance with a particular tool
