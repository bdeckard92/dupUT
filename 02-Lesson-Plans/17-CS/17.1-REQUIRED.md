# Module 17 Virtual Class: Computer Science for JavaScript

## Overview 

In today's virtual class, students will practice computer science fundamentals as they apply to JavaScript using closures and callback queues.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Identify lexical scope and use closures

* Describe the function of the callback queue

## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* Closures are introduced in Lesson 2 and callback queues are introduced in Lesson 1.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Invite students to post questions in the Zoom chat so TAs and/or the instructor can address them at the end of class.

* Open the lesson's [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1udd8RlVgxsmPjt2ugzIgvVF1zFClwfD1hWzeyvtQbr8/edit?usp=sharing) and walk through the following slides on foundation setting: 

   **Big Picture**: This is an opportunity to look at the big picture of where students are in the course. Take a moment to discuss a few real-world examples of why this week's topics are valuable.

   **Boot Camp Pointers**: Review some logistics that will help students stay on track. This is an opportunity to speak to what students might need at this particular point in the course. 

   **This Week**: Review the key skills students will be learning this week.

   **This Week's Assignment**: Give a quick summary of this week's Challenge assignment and describe how the skills they learn throughout the week will be applied to it.

   **Career Connection**: Reinforce that students will use the skills they learn this week throughout their careers. It's important for them to know the "why" and "how" behind the "what." Give examples of how these skills are used on the job. If you feel comfortable, share examples of how you have used them in your professional career.

   * Let students know that Computer Science for JavaScript is perhaps one of the most important weeks for boot camp students as they relate to technical interviews.

    * Let students know that while algorithms and data structures are often used to test prospective candidates prior to making a job offer.

    * Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

        * ☝ Why are algorithms so frequently used in technical interviewing?

        * 🙋 Algorithms are domain neutral, which means you can use them to test candidates from various backgrounds, whether they traditionally work in back-end, front-end, security, DevOps, or other roles. They are also foundational to seeing how candidates try to solve problems.

    * Essentially, as developers, our job is to solve problems. Asking a candidate to solve, or try to solve, an algorithm is a great indicator of how that person will try to solve problems on the job. It often doesn't matter whether the answer is correct, but HOW a candidate goes about trying to solve something they don't know. 

    * Let students know that it can be frustrating to have to be able to solve algorithms to get a job. We spend the majority of the time in class learning how to develop applications—which is what students will do once they get that job.

    * If possible, share some of your experiences with technical interviewing and having to solve algorithms. 

    * Encourage students to practice solving algorithms as often as possible using sites such as [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/), [CodeSignal](https://codesignal.com/), and others.

   **How to Succeed This Week**: Remind students that they might experience moments of frustration as they learn complex concepts and tools, and that these times are actually proven opportunities to deepen knowledge. Consider sharing something about your personal learning journey. This helps students recognize that everyone starts somewhere and that they are not alone.

   **Today's Objectives**: Outline the concepts that will be covered in today's lesson. Remind students that they can find the relevant activity files in the "Getting Ready for Class" page in their course content. 

### 2. Instructor Do: Student Check-In (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

  * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back at what we've accomplished and acknowledge that it is a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed&mdash;as long as you don’t give up.

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic?

  * 🙋 Let's do Fist to Five together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).

### 3. Instructor Demo: Closures (5 min)

* Open `01-Closures/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We first create a function named `counter`, which will be the outer function and create a closure around the soon-to-exist inner function. Inside this outer function, we place a variable, called `count`:

    ```js
    function counter() {
      let count = 0;
    }
    ```
  
  * 🔑 Next we add an inner function named `increment` and return it. The inner function now exists within the closure and is lexically bound to the outer function.

    ```js
    return {
      increment: function () {
        return ++count;
      },
    };
    ```

* Navigate to `01-Console/index.html` in the browser and open Chrome DevTool's console:

  * 🔑 To check out how lexical binding works, we navigate to Chrome's DevTools and enter `console.dir()` in the console to display a list of the method's properties, including the scope.

    ```js
    console.dir(counter());
    ```

  * 🔑 Scope is a property of the `counter()` method object. We see that it has a closure that references outer function's `count` variable. This is because in JavaScript, an inner function is lexically bound to the outer function and has access to the outer function's variables. This is called lexical scoping.

    ```text
    Object
      increment: ƒ ()
        arguments: null
        caller: null
        length: 0
        name: "increment"
        prototype: {constructor: ƒ}
        [[FunctionLocation]]: index.js:7
        [[Prototype]]: ƒ ()
        [[Scopes]]: Scopes[2]
          0: Closure (counter) {count: 0}
          1: Global {0: global, window: Window, self: Window, document: document, name: '', location: Location, …}
    ```

  * 🔑 We also notice that the `counter()` function belongs to the global scope. However, when we go outside of the closure by logging the `count` variable in the console, the variable is undefined in the global scope. That is because a variable declared in closure is bound to the closure -- or private -- and is not available outside of its lexical scope.

    ```js
    console.log(count);
    ```

  * 🔑 There is also an uncaught reference error in the console noting the counter module is undefined. This is not scope! This error happens because we are running our code in the browser and modules only work in node.js. Since we need to run our tests in a Node environment, we can ignore this error for now.

    ```text
    Uncaught ReferenceError: module is not defined
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 In Lesson 2, we went over an example where we used closures to increment the `count` variable.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

    * 🙋 Closures have developed an infamous reputation for being a difficult screening question in interviews. Although the Challenge is about creating a tutorial specifically on regex, being able to explain and clearly communicate difficult topics, such as closures, will help you with the Challenge. 

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We need to use a closure in order to access the `count` variable in the lexical scope.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Closures (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-Closures/README.md`, which is also shown here:

    ```md
    # 📖 Create a Counter Function That Uses a Private Variable

    Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

    * As a teacher, I want a way to keep track of the number of students I see every day.

    * As a developer, I want to keep my `count` variable data private.

    ## Acceptance Criteria

    * It's done when the `counter` function correctly increments by 1.

    * It's done when I can only access the `count` variable from within the `counter` function.

    * It's done when I enter `npm install` and `npm test` in the terminal and all the tests pass.

    ## 📝 Notes

    Refer to the documentation:

    [MDN web docs on closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures)

    ## 🏆 Bonus

    If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

    * What is dynamic scoping? How is it different than lexical scoping?

    Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this. 
    ```

### 5. Instructor Review: Closures (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ Closures

  * ✔️ Private variables

  * ✔️ Lexical scope

* Open `01-Closures/Solved/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 By creating the function `counter`, we have also created a closure.

    ```js
    function counter() {
      // Code...
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 Inside the outer function, we create a private `count` variable that will hold the number of times the function is called.

    ```js
    function counter() {

      let count = 0;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 Next, we use the closure by returning an object by using the `increment` method, which increases the `count` by one. This works because the inner `increment` method is lexically bound to the outer `counter` function. 

    ```js
    function counter() {
    
      let count = 0;

      return {

        increment: function () {
        
          return ++count;
        },
      };
    }
    ```

  * If we type `npm install` and `npm test` in the command line, we should see the following indicating all our tests now pass:

    ```bash
      PASS  __tests__/index.test.js
      √ counter is a defined function (2 ms)
      √ counter is returning as an object
      √ count should equal 0 (1 ms)
      √ count should equal 1
      √ count should equal 4

    Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
    Tests:       5 passed, 5 total
    Snapshots:   0 total
    Time:        1.974 s
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How else could we use closures?

    * 🙋 We could conceal sensitive variables that shouldn't be mutated outside of the function's scope.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 2, read the [MDN Web Docs on Closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures), and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Callback Queue (5 min) 

* Open `02-Callback-Queue/Solved/index.html` in your browser to demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 When we open the page in the browser, the form text boxes load and are interactive immediately.

    * 🔑 The submit button only appears after 8 seconds.

    * 🔑 This is a callback queue is at work. Because `setTimeout` is a Web API, it does not get placed in the call stack. Instead, once the timer resolves, the callback function is first placed in the callback queue.

    * 🔑 Functions in the callback queue only get executed when the program is over and the call stack is empty.
    
    * 🔑 A callback queue then works with async functions like `setTimeout` to process the functions in a first in first out manner.

    * 🔑 While this may seem tricky at first, understanding the callback queue is especially important when working with asynchronous JavaScript to make sure your functions work in order and as expected.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 In Lesson 1, we discussed JavaScript fundamentals including JavaScript's stacks, queues, and heaps.

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

    * 🙋 Similar to the closures activity, although callback queues are not directly related to the Challenge, understanding how it works and being able to explain it clearly will help you succeed at interviews.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 Order matters with callback queues! The timing of a async function like `setTimeout` into the callback queue can determine how fast -- or slow -- the function is executed.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Callback Queues (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Callback-Queue/README.md`, which are also shown here:

     ```md
     # 🐛 User Interaction with Application Is Blocked on Page Load

     Work with a partner to resolve the following issue:

     * User interactivity with the application is blocked on page load.

     ## Expected Behavior

     * When the page loads, a user can interact with the form elements.

     * After 8 seconds, the submit button appears.

     ## Actual Behavior

     * When the page loads, a user is temporarily blocked from interacting with any elements on the page.

     ## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

     1. Open the `index.html` file in the browser.

     2. The page takes an extended length of time to load.

     ---

     ## 💡 Hints

     * What is a better user experience for delaying functionality?

     ## 🏆 Bonus

     If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

     * What are common blocking and non-blocking functions in JavaScript?

     Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
     ```

### 8. Instructor Review: Event Delegation (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Open `02-Callback-Queue/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We add a class to initially hide the `<button>` element.

    ```html
    <button class="btn form-input display-none">Submit</button>
    ```

* Open `02-Callback-Queue/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 We can leverage the asynchronous behavior of JavaScript by placing the delay in a `setTimeout()`.

    ```js
    setTimeout(() => {
      document.querySelector('form button')
        .classList.remove('display-none');
    }, 8000);
    ```

  * Delaying with a `setTimeout()` allows the page to render and time for the user to interact with the other elements.

  * 🔑 Best practice is to use timers when creating intentional delays instead of blocking the event loop with synchronous logic.
  
  * Node.js and the browser work similarly in the way they handle asynchronous behavior.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why do synchronous processes block the call stack?

  * 🙋 JavaScript is single threaded, so synchronous network requests or large processing loads occupy the thread, not allowing any other code to execute. 

  * ☝️ What is the role of the event loop in asynchronous behavior in JavaScript?

  * 🙋 The event loop pushes callback functions onto the call stack from the callback queue when the call stack is empty or idle.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 1, read the [MDN Web Docs on the event loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop#Event_loop), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

    * 🙋 We learned about the usefulness of closures and event delegation. 

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful. 

    * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

    * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the Challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer. 

    * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

    * 🙋 Closures and event delegation were covered in Lesson 2.

    * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Use student answers to transition to Office Hours.

### 10. Challenge Review (30 min)

* Take this time to help get students unblocked on any Challenges that they are working through.

* Expect that students may ask for the following:

  * Further review on a particular subject

  * Debugging assistance

  * Help with computer issues

  * Guidance with a particular tool
