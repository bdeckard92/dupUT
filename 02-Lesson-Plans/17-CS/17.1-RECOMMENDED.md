# Module 17 Virtual Class (Recommended): Computer Science for JavaScript

## Overview 

In today's recommended virtual class, students will practice using closures and event delegation, as well as solve a new algorithm in CodeSignal.  

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Solve the CodeSignal algorithm `wordTumble`

* Utilize closures

* Utilize event delegation


## Instructor Notes

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* Closures and event delegations were both introduced in Lesson 2.

## Class Instructions 

### 1. Introduction (5 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Direct students to post individual questions in the Zoom chat to be addressed by TAs and/or at the end of class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

    * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back and see what we accomplished, and acknowledge that it's a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic? 

    * 🙋 Let's do "fist to five" together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).


### 2. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* [Click here for CodeSignal challenge](https://app.codesignal.com/public-test/W38trZ3bQdqpabN2X/SvJ3vebQ5oLSJu) 

* Remind students that practicing algorithm-based interview questions is one of the best ways to prep for interviews because:

    * companies often use algorithm questions to test candidates' knowledge, despite not using these kinds of algorithms every day.

    * it is great practice to learn new JavaScript methods and to solidify knowledge.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Did anyone attempt the Code Signal algorithm?

    * 🙋 It is encouraged to take advantage of the CodeSignal practice because it reflects real-world online interviewing.

* Open your IDE and review the solution to the CodeSignal algorithm:

    * The algorithm is called 'wordTumble'. We are given a string, `str` and are asked to reverse, or "tumble", any words that have 5 or more letters.

    * For example:
    
        `wordTumble("Hello this is a fantastic example") => "elloH this is a citsatnaf elpmaxe"`

        `wordTumble("This is another test") => "This is rehtona test"`

    * The instructions provide the following details regarding input and output:

    ```md
    Strings will only consist of letters and spaces
    Spaces will be included only to separate words

    [execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)

    [input] string str

    [output] string
    ```

* We are also provided the following starter code:

```js
function wordTumble(str) {

}
```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝) and call on students for answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What is the first step to solve this problem?

    * 🙋 In order to check if each of the words are equal to or greater than 5 letters, we'll need to break them out into an array.

    * ☝ Exactly! So let's split the string at each space in the sentence.

    ```js
    let words = str.split(" ");
    ```

    * ☝ So once we have this set up, what are your next steps to solving this problem?

    * 🙋 We need a `for` loop that allows us to loop through the array of words and checks whether the word is 5 letters or more. If it is, we can split that individual word, reverse it, and join it back together!

    * ☝ Great!

    ```js
    for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
        if (words[i].length >= 5) {
            words[i] = words[i].split("").reverse().join("");
        }
    }
    ```

    * 🙋 And don't forget to return everything joined back together! 

    ```js
    return words.join(" ");
    ```

* Full solution:

```js
function wordTumble(str) {
    let words = str.split(" ");

    for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
        if (words[i].length >= 5) {
            words[i] = words[i].split("").reverse().join("");
        }
    }
    return words.join(" ");
}
```

* Answer any questions students have before moving to the next activity.

### 3. Instructor Demo: Closures (5 min) 

* Navigate to `01-Closures/Solved/` in your command line and run `node index.js`

    * 🔑 In the console, we see "Lee" and then "Kim" printed.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 In Lesson 2, we went over an example where we used closures to increment the `count` variable. 

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 Closures have developed an infamous reputation for being a difficult screening question in interviews. Although the challenge is about creating a tutorial specifically on regex, being able to explain and clearly communicate difficult topics, such as closures, will help you with the challenge. 

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We need to use a closure in order to access the `name` variable in the lexical environment.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 4. Student Do: Closures (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `01-Closures/README.md`.

    ```md
    # Closures

    In this activity, you will practice using closures and understanding scope.

    ## Instructions

    * Navigate to [Unsolved](Unsolved/) in your command line and run `node index.js` and note what name is logged in the console.

    * Open the [index.js](Unsolved/index.js) file.

    * Create a closure inside the `person()` function called `displayName()`

    * Invoke the `displayName()` in order to print "Lee" in the console.
    ```


### 5. Instructor Review: Closures (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ `displayName()`

    * ✔️ Invoke `displayName()`

* Open `01-Closures/Solved/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * We see that there are two variables called `name`. They are assigned to two different values, "Kim" and "Lee".

    * When we run `node index.js` only "Kim" is printed in the console.

    * 🔑 We create a closure inside the `person()` function called `displayName()`.

    ```js
    return function displayName() {
      console.log(name);
    };
    ```

    * We can access the `name` variable and log it into the console through this closure.

    * 🔑 Outside of the function, we create the function caller, `friend`, and invoke `friend()` which will print "Lee" in the console.

    ```js
    let friend = person();
    friend();
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Why is it possible to have two variables called "name"?

    * 🙋 The references in the closure are not exposed to the rest of the application. Therefore it is private and only accessible through the closure. That's why the `console.log(name)` outside of `person()` only prints out "Kim" and the only way to access `name` inside `person()` is through invoking `displayName()`.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 2, read the [MDN docs on Closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 6. Instructor Demo: Event Delegation (5 min) 

* Open `02-Event-Delegation/Solved/index.html` in your browser to demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 We see a list of fruits, each with a button "Add to Cart"

    * 🔑 When we click on the button, that item is added to the "Shopping Cart" list below.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

    * 🙋 In Lesson 2, we delegated events using closures by attaching the event listener to the common parent element of a list of buttons. 

    * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the challenge?

    * 🙋 Similar to the closures activity, although event delegation is not directly related to the challenge, understanding how it works and being able to explain it clearly will help you succeed at interviews.

    * ☝️ How would we build this?

    * 🙋 We need to create an event listener that will listen for a "click" of any of the buttons in the fruits list and append the name of the clicked fruit to the shopping cart list.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 7. Student Do: Event Delegation (15 min) 

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Event-Delegation/README.md`.

    ```md
    # Event Delegation

    In this activity, you will use event delegation to listen for "clicks" on multiple items in order to add them to your shopping cart.

    ## Instructions

    * Open [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) and examine the code. 

    * Open [script.js](Unsolved/script.js) and do the following:

    * Create an event listener on the common parent element of the fruits. You can refer to `index.html` as needed.

    * When a button is clicked, create a `div` that will hold the name of the fruit and append it to the `#shopping-cart`.
    
    ## Hint(s)

    * In order to get the name of the fruit, notice what unique identifier you can use from the `#grocery-list`.
    ```


### 8. Instructor Review: Event Delegation (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms. 

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ `addEventListener()`

    * ✔️ `event.target.matches('button')`

    * ✔️ `event.target.parentElement.id`

* Open `02-Event-Delegation/Solved/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * We see all of the variables we will need already created for us on top.

    ```js
    const listEl = document.querySelector('#grocery-list');
    const shoppingCartEl = document.querySelector('#shopping-cart');
    const fruits = ['Bananas', 'Apples', 'Oranges', 'Grapes', 'Blueberries'];
    ```

    * 🔑 We need to create an event listener on the parent element of the fruits, which is `#grocery-list` assigned to `listEl`.

    ```js
    listEl.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
        event.preventDefault();
    ```

    * 🔑 Then, within the callback, we determine whether the clicked item was a button or not by using `event.target.matches('button')`. This technique is known as event delegation. Instead of writing a `for` loop and adding event listeners to every button element, we added an event listener to its parent element `#grocery-list`. 

    ```js
    if (event.target.matches('button')) {
    ```

    * Once we determine that a button was clicked, we create a `div` element to contain the name of the fruit clicked.

    ```js
    const item = document.createElement('div');
    ```

    * To identify which fruit was clicked, we use `event.target.parentElement.id` to grab the `id` of the list item where the click happened. Then we use that `id` number to find the corresponding fruit from the `fruits` array. We assign it to `item.textContent`

    ```js
    item.textContent = fruits[event.target.parentElement.id];
    ```

    * Finally, we append the `item` to the `#shopping-cart` div.

    ```js
    shoppingCartEl.append(item);
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How does using event delegation simplify your code? 

    * 🙋 Event delegation allows you to avoid adding event listeners to specific nodes;  instead, the event listener is added to one parent.  That event listener analyzes bubbled events to find a match on child elements.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 2, read the [MDN docs on events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 09. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

    * 🙋 We learned about the usefulness of closures and event delegation. 

    * ☝️ What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * 🙋 All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's not necessary to know any one area completely to be successful. 

    * ☝️ Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material before class as possible?

    * 🙋 It's important both to be fully prepared to start the challenge and because it will prepare you for your future career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in the boot camp. Lessons are intentionally designed to give each topic an optimal amount of depth and scope so that you have a solid foundation to build upon in future lessons. The skills you learn in the lessons are cutting-edge, real-world skills that you will use in your career as a full-stack web developer. 

    * ☝️ Where in the asynchronous lessons can you learn more?

    * 🙋 Closures and event delegation were covered in Lesson 2.

    * ☝️ What excites you about the remaining lessons for this week?

* Use student answers to transition to Office Hours.
