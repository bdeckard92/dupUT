## Class Instructions 

### 1. Introduction (5 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Direct students to post individual questions in the Zoom chat to be addressed by TAs and/or at the end of class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How are you feeling about your progress so far?

    * 🙋 We are adding another layer to our full-stack skill set. It's important to look back and see what we accomplished, and acknowledge that it's a lot! It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed as long as you don’t give up.

    * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this topic? 

    * 🙋 Let's do "fist to five" together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).


### 2. Everyone Do: Career Connection (20 min)

* [Click here for CodeSignal challenge](https://app.codesignal.com/public-test/W38trZ3bQdqpabN2X/SvJ3vebQ5oLSJu) 

* Remind students that practicing algorithm-based interview questions is one of the best ways to prep for interviews because:

    * companies often use algorithm questions to test candidates knowledge, despite not using these kinds of algorithms every day

    * it is great practice to learn new JavaScript methods and to solidify knowledge

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Did anyone attempt the Code Signal algorithm?

    * 🙋 It is encouraged to take advantage of the CodeSignal practice because it reflects real-world online interviewing.

* Open your IDE and review the solution to the CodeSignal algorithm:

    * The algorithm is called 'wordTumble'. We are given a string, `str` and are asked to reverse, or "tumble", any words that have 5 or more letters.

    * For example:
    
        `wordTumble("Hello this is a fantastic example") => "elloH this is a citsatnaf elpmaxe"`

        `wordTumble("This is another test") => "This is rehtona test"`


    * The instructions provide the following details regarding input and output:

    ```md
    Strings will only consist of letters and spaces
    Spaces will be included only to separate words

    [execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)

    [input] string str

    [output] string
    ```

* We are also provided the following starter code:

```js
function wordTumble(str) {

}
```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝) and call on students for answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What is the first step to solve this problem?

    * 🙋 In order to check if each of the words are equal to or greater than 5 letters, we'll need to break them out into an array.



    * ☝ Exactly! So let's split the string at each space in the sentence.

    ```js
    let words = str.split(" ");
    ```

    * ☝So once we have this set up, what were your next steps to solving this problem?

    * 🙋 A for-loop that allows us to loop through the array of words, and checks whether the word is 5 letters or more. If it is, we can split that individual word, reverse it, and join it back together!

    * ☝Great!

    ```js
    for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
        if (words[i].length >= 5) {
            words[i] = words[i].split("").reverse().join("");
        }
    }
    ```

    * 🙋 And don't forget to return everything joined back together! 

    ```js
    return words.join(" ");
    ```

* Answer any questions students have before moving to the next activity.

* Full solution:
```js
function wordTumble(str) {
    let words = str.split(" ");

    for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {

        if (words[i].length >= 5) {

            words[i] = words[i].split("").reverse().join("");
        }
    }

    return words.join(" ");
}

}
```
