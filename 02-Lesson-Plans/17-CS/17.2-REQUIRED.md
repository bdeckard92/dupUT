# 17.2 Virtual Class: Computer Science for JavaScript

## Overview

In today's virtual class, students will practice explore the Fibonacci algorithm and recursion, implement a binary search, and use regex to match a username.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Use recursion to solve a Fibonacci sequence algorithm.

* Implement a binary search algorithm.

* Use regex to match the requirements for a username.

## Instructor Notes

* This week, students learned Computer Science fundamentals as they apply to JavaScript. It is heavier on concepts, but it will help them think like a developer and prepare them for interviews.

* In fact, this last phase of the boot camp is more about being employer-ready, improving the skills they have already learned, and making their web applications more performant and efficient. Basically, students will focus on "Life after Boot Camp".

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* You will use Jest in the `04-Binary-Search` activity. Before class, be sure to familiarize yourself with the unit tests and their descriptions.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* Binary searches are covered in Lesson 3 and the Fibonacci algorithm is covered in Lesson 5.

* Regex was not covered in the async lessons, however it is the topic used in this week's Challenge. Students may struggle with the `05-Regex` activity because it is their first time seeing it, but encourage them to research online and use this activity as practice for their Challenge.

* Spend some time at the end of class to go over GitHub gists, which will be used for their Challenge.

## Office Hours

Encourage students to work on the remaining module algorithms during Office Hours. Review the algorithm solutions 5–10 minutes before class begins.

## Class Instructions

### 1. Introduction (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What did you learn this week? How would you explain it to your friends and family?

  * 🙋 We learned about some computer science concepts behind JavaScript, including performance measurement, data structures, and algorithms. We also practiced describing our problem-solving process using pseudocoding. We went over closures, factory functions, and event delegation. We are moving fast compared to traditional learners. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed, as long as we don’t give up!

  * ☝️ Did anyone have an "Aha!" or "Eureka!" moment this week? When was it and why did things suddenly click for you?

  * 🙋 Eureka moments happen when we try different approaches to a problem or change the way we're thinking about it.

  * ☝️ Did anyone feel stuck this week? How did you get unstuck?

  * 🙋 It's easy to get stuck when you're learning web development. It's important to learn how to get unstuck because it happens to the pros too. Rather than getting lost in search results, consult the tool's official documentation first. Then ask for help from instructional staff or your peers. Study groups are great because explaining your problems to someone else often reveals the solution.

### 2. Review Current Challenge (5 min)

* This module is very different from previous modules. Likewise, the Challenge for this module is also very different. Instead of a coding activity, it is writing a GitHub gist explaining regex. Take some time to go over the Challenge.

* Open the [README.md](../../01-Class-Content/17-CS/02-Challenge/README.md) for this week's Challenge and go over the following:

  * This Challenge is different from any other Challenge you've done so far. That's because we want you to start thinking like a developer. A developer writes code, but they also write **about** code.

  * This Challenge is to create a gist on GitHub that will be a tutorial on regex. You will need to familiarize yourself with regex, so later in the class, we will do an activity on regex to help you understand and use it.

  * You will need to clone the starter code and modify the contents to create your tutorial on regex. The starter code is a template with a title, introductory paragraph, summary, and table of contents. The table of contents should link to sections of the tutorial that describe the functionality of each component in the regex. Be sure to rename the template to a unique name that describes your tutorial.

  * Although creating a gist is an easy, straight-forward task, we will go over it briefly at the end of class. It functions just like a repository, and you’ll use Markdown to create it, which you already know how to do! Gists can include code, images, links, and anything else you can include in a README.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What recently acquired skills will help us build this Challenge?

  * 🙋 Throughout this module, we not only learned about concepts and fundamentals, but we also practiced describing our problem-solving process. We just have to put that in writing now! It will take practice to clearly put your thinking process in writing, and we don't expect it to be perfect this first time around! But after completing this Challenge, you should be able to get in the habit of writing technical walkthroughs about the different languages and skills you've learned so far in this boot camp.

  * ☝️ How are these skills relevant to a career in web development?

  * 🙋 Whether it is in writing, like a tech blog, or in speech, like during a technical interview, the ability to clearly explain difficult technical concepts is an important skill to have as a developer. You should be able to clearly explain and communicate technical knowledge, whether it is talking about a project within your team at work or giving a presentation of your product in front of executives.

  * ☝️ How will this Challenge improve your portfolio?

  * 🙋 It will show employers that we are capable of communicating technical knowledge to others, which is a very valuable skill to have in the workplace!

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 3. Instructor Demo: Recursion (5 min)

* Navigate to `03-Recursion` from the command line, run `node index.js` and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 When we run this file, we get a number printed on the page.

  * 🔑 While we could have done this code with a loop, this Fibonacci algorithm uses recursion.

* Navigate to `03-Recursion/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following

  * 🔑 Instead of a loop, we use a recursive function. A recursive function calls itself over and over again until the condition is met.

  * 🔑 This condition is important. If we didn't have this condition in place -- known as a "base" or "exit" condition -- our program would loop indefinitely and cause our program to crash.

  * 🔑 A Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where the next number is found by adding the two numbers before it. Since a Fibonacci sequence relies on repeating a pattern of actions until a condition is met, it is great use case for recursion.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 In Lesson 5, we learned to pseudocode a Fibonacci algorithm and break down the logic step-by-step.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

  * 🙋 Although the Challenge is about creating a tutorial specifically on regex, being able to explain and clearly communicate difficult topics, such as recursion, will help you with the Challenge.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We need to create an algorithm that has a base condition. The recursive function will call itself again and again until this base condition is met.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Recursion (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `03-Recursion/README.md`, which are also shown here:

```md
# 📐 Add Comments to Implementation of a Fibonacci Sequence Algorithm

Work with a partner to add comments that describe the functionality of the code found in [03-Recursion/Unsolved](./Unsolved).

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation:

[Math Is Fun: The Fibonacci Sequence](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/Fibonacci-sequence.html)

---

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* In programming, what is a stack overflow?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
```

### 5. Instructor Review: Recursion (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ We search by position

  * ✔️ No recursion for 0 or 1 positions

  * ✔️ Value is the sum of previous values

* Open `03-/Solved/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 The function returns the value of a given position in the Fibonacci sequence.

    ```js
    const Fibonacci = (position) => {}
    ```

    * 🔑 If the input position is less than `2`, we can assume that the position will be `0` or `1`, which are the actual values of the Fibonacci sequence at that position.

      ```js
      if (position < 2) {
        return position;
      }
      ```

  * 🔑 We get a value of the Fibonacci sequence by adding the previous two position values in the sequence, so we need to calculate their values with the same function, which will call it again and again until `position` is under `2`.

    ```js
    return Fibonacci(position - 1) + Fibonacci(position - 2);
    ```

  * Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How can we visualize this algorithm? Is there a specific data structure we can use to model it?

  * 🙋 We can visualize it as a binary tree data structure, with each node spawning two nodes below it, which then spawn two nodes below them, and so on.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson , read about the [Fibonacci sequence](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/Fibonacci-sequence.html) and the [MDN Web Docs on recursive functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions#Recursion), and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Instructor Demo: Binary Search (5 min)

* Open the [Searching Sorted List visualizer](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Search.html) in your browser, perform a binary search, and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 Unlike the linear search, a binary search works by checking one value at a time starting in the middle of the data set.

  * 🔑 We identify if the value we're searching for is greater or less than the middle value and cut out half of the data set when we know the value is in the other half.

  * 🔑 If we don't find the element we're looking for, we receive a `-1` back, because there is no `-1` index in a JavaScript array.

* Open `04-Binary-Search/Solved/index.js` in your IDE and show the following:

  * 🔑 This code uses a while loop and if/else statements to conduct the search. The code will execute again and again until the element is found.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where have we used this before?

  * 🙋 We learned about binary searches in Lesson 3.

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

  * 🙋 Although the Challenge is about creating a tutorial specifically on regex, being able to explain and clearly communicate difficult topics, such as binary searches, will help you with the Challenge.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 In a binary search, one value is checked at a time starting from the middle until the condition is met. We can use a while loop and if/else statement to build a binary search algorithm.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Student Do: Binary Search (15 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Binary-Search/README.md`.

  ```md
  # 🐛 Binary Search Algorithm Not Passing Tests

  Work with a partner to resolve the following issue:

  * As a developer, I want to be able to find the position of a value in a data set by using a binary search function.

  ## Expected Behavior

  When we run unit tests to test the binary search function, the defined tests pass.

  ## Actual Behavior

  When we run unit tests to test the binary search function, the defined tests do not pass.

  ## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

  1. In the command line, from the [Unsolved](./Unsolved) directory, run `npm install`.

  2. Run `npm run test` to run the unit tests.

  3. The tests defined in the `__tests__` directory do not pass.

  ## 💡 Hints

  How can the unit test descriptions help us determine what the function is or is not doing?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What is worst possible Big-O complexity that an algorithm can have? What is the best?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

### 8. Instructor Review: Binary Search (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ Adjust start and end positions

  * ✔️ The `while` loop

  * ✔️ Exit conditions

* Open `04-Binary-Search/Solved/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We start by getting the start and end positions, which we will update when we determine what half our value lies in:

    ```js
    let start = 0;
    let end = array.length - 1;
    ```

  * 🔑 We use a `while` loop to continuously run the functionality of getting a middle value, checking if the searched value is greater than, less than, or equal to it, and adjusting the start and end points if we need to:

    ```js
    while (start <= end) {
      let mid = Math.floor((start + end) / 2);

      if (array[mid] === element) {
        return true;
      } else if (array[mid] < element) {
        start = mid + 1;
      } else {
        end = mid - 1;
      }
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 We are done running this function when either the middle value is the value we're searching for or we've cut the search array down so much that the end value becomes less than the start value and the `while` loop ends to return `false`.


* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What is the Big O complexity of this algorithm?

  * 🙋 It has a Big O complexity of `O(log n)` because it effectively cuts its input in half every pass.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to Lesson 3, read the [Wikipedia entry on binary search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm), and stay for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Instructor Demo: Regex (5 min)

* Regex was not covered in the async lessons. However, it is the topic used in this week's Challenge. Students may struggle with this activity because it is their first time seeing regex, but encourage them to research online and use this activity as practice for their Challenge.

* Navigate to [RegExr](https://regexr.com/) in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 Regex is used to find patterns in text.

  * 🔑 Here we see a paragraph of text, and on top of the screen there is an Expression. This expression is looking for all words that start with a capital letter. The words that match that expression are highlighted.

  * 🔑 In the left-hand menu, there is a link to RegEx Reference, which you can use to build your own regex.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How does this activity equip us for the Challenge?

  * 🙋 This will familiarize ourselves with regex so that we can write a tutorial about it for the Challenge.

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We need to understand the different components of the expression so that it captures exactly what we are searching for.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 10. Student Do: Regex (20 min)

* Divide students into breakout rooms.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `05-Regex/README.md`.

```md
# Regex

In this activity, you will write a regex (regular expression) to find certain patterns of characters within a string to validate a username. This activity will help you understand and practice using regex in order for you to succeed in this week's Challenge.

## Instructions

* Open the [regex.md](Unsolved/regex.md) file.

* Create a regex that fulfills the following requirements for a username:

  * can contain any lowercase letter between a-z

  * can contain any number between 0-9

  * can contain an underscore or hyphen

  * is between 3 - 16 characters long

* You can use [RegExr](https://regexr.com/) to test out your regex.

  * In the `Text` section, type a username that does fulfill the requirements, i.e. `janedoe_123`.

  * In the `Expression` section, test out your regex that will match that username. You will know your regex is correct if it shows a match.

  * You can also test it out by changing the `Text` to a username that does NOT follow the requirements, i.e. `JaneDoe_123`. Notice it will say "No match" if your regex is correct.

## Hint(s)

* Use the "RegEx Reference" section on [RegExr](https://regexr.com/) to familiarize yourself with the patterns to make your regex.
```

### 11. Instructor Review: Regex (10 min)

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ `^` and `$`

  * ✔️ `[]`

  * ✔️ `{}`

* Open `05-Regex/Solved/regex.md` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * There are many components involved in this expression. Here is the breakdown of each of those components.

  * 🔑 First, we use `^` to match the beginning of a string and `$` to match the end of the string

    ```regex
    /^   $/
    ```

  * 🔑 Then we use the `[]` to enclose the types of characters we are matching. In our case, that's any lowercase letter between `a-z`, any number between `0-9`, underscore `_`, and a hyphen `-`.

    ```regex
    [a-z0-9_-]
    ```

  * 🔑 Finally we use a quantifier `{}` to specify that we want it to be between 3-16 characters long.

    ```regex
    {3, 16}
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What can you do if you don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 Finding resources online is an excellent skill to have as a developer because we will always be learning about new (or old) technologies and we won't always have someone to ask!

  * We can also play around with tools like [RegExr](https://regexr.com/) to figure out what each component does in a regex.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 12. Introduction to GitHub gist (5 min)

* For this challenge, students will create a gist instead of creating a repository on GitHub. Although it is new to the students, reassure them that it is easy and not so different from creating README markdown files that they are used to creating.

* Navigate to the [gist home page](https://gist.github.com/) and demonstrate the following:

  * After you have cloned the starter code, sign in to GitHub and navigate to the [gist home page](https://gist.github.com/).

  * Type in the name and description of your tutorial.

  * Insert the starter code into the gist text box.

  * Finally, click the `Create public gist` button to create your gist. It's that simple! Now you can edit the starter code to create your tutorial.

* Direct students to the additional resources available to them:

  * Reflection and Retrieval

  * Career Connection

  * Dessert Menu

### 13. Introduce Upcoming Challenge & Promote Additional Resources (5 min)

* Navigate to `01-Class-Content/18-NoSQL/02-Challenge/Main` from the command line and run `node server.js`.

* Open Insomnia and demonstrate the following:

  * You are going to build an API for a social network using a NoSQL database, MongoDB.

  * When we make a GET request for users and thoughts, we can see the data displayed in JSON.

  * We can also make POST, PUT, and DELETE requests for user and thoughts.

  * We can also create and delete reactions to thoughts, as well as add and remove friends from a user's friend list.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are we learning?

  * 🙋 We are learning about the popular NoSQL database system, MongoDB, as well as the Mongoose ODM.

  * ☝️ How does this project build off or extend previously learned material?

  * 🙋 We are creating a Node application using Express.

  * ☝️ How does this project relate to your career goals?

  * 🙋 Even though SQL is the most widely known and used database system, the surge of popularity in JavaScript in recent years led to the development of NoSQL databases like MongoDB. Therefore, knowing how to use both SQL and NoSQL databases will make us even stronger full-stack developers.

* ☝️ **ONE MORE THING** before we dismiss! In the next module on NoSQL, you'll learn how to deploy MongoDB applications to Heroku using MongoDB Atlas in your asynchronous lessons. Use these supplemental guides on [Setting Up MongoDB Atlas](../../01-Class-Content/18-NoSQL/04-Supplemental/MongoAtlas-Setup.md) and [Deploying with Heroku and MongoDB Atlas](../../01-Class-Content/18-NoSQL/04-Supplemental/MongoAtlas-Deploy.md) as additional resources as you work on the next module.
