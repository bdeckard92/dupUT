# Module 17 Instructor Overview: Commputer Science

## Overview

In this module, students will prepare for job interviews by learning about the computer science behind JavaScript, including performance measurement, data structures, and algorithms. Students will also also practice describing your problem-solving process using pseudocoding.

In this week's virtual classes, you'll go over closures, factory functions, event delegation, and the Fibonacci algorithm. You will also spend a good amount of time in this week's second virtual class going over the Challenge, which will look a bit different from what students are used to seeing.

## Overview of Asynchronous Material 

Why are students learning {MODULE TOPIC}?

* @TODO LIST REASONS WHY THIS MODULE'S TOPIC IS IMPORTANT FOR STUDENTS' CAREERS

Throughout the async module this week, students will use {MODULE TOPIC} to do the following:

* @TODO LIST HOW STUDENTS WILL USE ASYNC CONTENT IN THIS WEEK'S MODULE

**Reminder:** If students need help with an async activity, encourage them to attend Office Hours for help! If you can’t get through all of it, remind them that they can lean on Learning Assistants with the AskBCS bot for more help.

## Virtual Classes

If your class started AFTER January 1, 2021, use these lesson plans:

* [Virtual Class XX.1](./XX.1-REQUIRED.md)

* [Virtual Class XX.2](./XX.2-REQUIRED.md)

If your class started BEFORE January 1, 2021, use these lesson plans:

* [Virtual Class (Recommended) XX.1](./XX.1-RECOMMENDED.md)

* [Virtual Class (Required) XX.2](./XX.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* @TODO PROJECT HEADS UP

* @TODO CHALLENGE HEADS UP

* @TODO TECHNICAL STUFF?

* @TODO ENCOURAGING MESSAGING

### Common Pain Points

According to our class data, students might experience some of the following pain points throughout the week:

@TODO FILL OUT CHART BY LISTING 2-4 PAIN POINTS AND SOLUTIONS

| Pain Point                          | Recommendation       |
| ---                                 | ---                  |
| {COMMON PAIN POINT FOR THIS MODULE} | {RECOMMENDED ACTION} |

## Career Connection

During each lesson that students work through, they will also view a Career Connection section that will tie together the academic content with Career Services and how this material will be applicable to them in their future career.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Director and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careerservicesonlineevents.splashthat.com/).

If you'd like more information on Career Services, visit the [Career Services resources page](https://mycareerspot.org/).

## Module Challenge

@TODO WHAT WILL THE STUDENTS BUILD FOR THEIR HOMEWORK?

[Module 17 Challenge](../../01-Class-Content/{XX-TITLE}/02-Challenge)

Specific skills students will need to implement in order to be successful:

* Explain a technical concept in your own words so that a non-technical user can understand it.

* Parse the different components of a search pattern within a technical tutorial.

* Think about the information a user will need to understand the concept you’re explaining.

* Write about your problem-solving process effectively so that other developers can understand how you solved a problem.

## Heads-Up

* Next week, students will learn about NoSQL databases, and more specifically, MongoDB. They will use [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/) as their ODM, so be sure to familiarize yourself with both before the next class. Although they will learn how to deploy MongoDB applications to Heroku using MongoDB Atlas in their asynchronous lessons, you should provide them with the supplemental guides on [Setting Up MongoDB Atlas](../../01-Class-Content/18-NoSQL/04-Supplemental/MongoAtlas-Setup.md) and [Deploying with Heroku and MongoDB Atlas](../../01-Class-Content/18-NoSQL/04-Supplemental/MongoAtlas-Deploy.md) at the end of this week's second virtual class.
