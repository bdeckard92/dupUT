# Module 17 Instructor Overview: Computer Science for JavaScript

## Overview

In this module, students will prepare for job interviews by learning about the computer science behind JavaScript, including performance measurement, data structures, and algorithms. Students will also practice using pseudocde to describe their problem-solving process.

In this week's virtual classes, you'll review closures, callback queues, recursion, and binary searches. You will also spend a good amount of time in the second virtual class reviewing the Challenge, which is a bit different from what students are used to seeing in previous modules. You will also introduce regex, which is not taught in the async materials but is needed for the Challenge.

The following table maps the key topics covered in the virtual lessons to where they are taught in the asynchronous content:

| Day  | Topic                  | Location     |
| ---  | ---                    | ---          |
| 1    | Closures               | 17.2         |
| 1    | Callbacks and queues   | 17.1         |
| 1    | Git Guide              | N/A          |
| 2    | Recursion              | 17.5         |
| 2    | Binary search          | 17.3         |
| 2    | Regex                  | Challenge    |

## Overview of Asynchronous Material

This week in the asynchronous content, students are introduced to computer science fundamentals. This knowledge is important for the following reasons:

* In order to succeed in interviews, students must understand computer science fundamentals such as performance measurement, data structures, and algorithms.

* Breaking down a coding challenge by using pseudocoding helps prepare students for interviews.

* Big O notation describes the code complexity using mathematical terms and introduces students to measuring the efficiency of their code.

* Data structures help students understand how data is stored, organized, and accessed in their code.

* Closures help students better understand scope and functional programming.

* Students will gain experience in object-oriented programming (OOP) design philosophy and be able to contrast it with functional programming.

Throughout the async module this week, students will use their knowledge of computer science fundamentals to do the following:

* Explain and identify the order of common search and sort algorithms.

* Explain how JavaScript works.

* Explain the difference between stacks and queues.

* Explain and implement closures.

* Implement performance-measuring interfaces.

* Explain the historical and contemporary importance of performance in computer science.

**Reminder**: If students need help with an async activity, encourage them to attend Office Hours. If they need more help, remind them that they can use Learning Assistants via the AskBCS bot.

The following table contains a description of each lesson's portion of the module project and the corresponding key points that are taught:

## Virtual Classes

Here are the lesson plans for this week's virtual classes:

* [Virtual Class 17.1](./17.1-REQUIRED.md)

* [Virtual Class 17.2](./17.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* This week, students will learn computer science fundamentals as they apply to JavaScript. Let students know that this module will be very different from what they're used to! It is heavier on concepts, which will help them think like a developer and prepare for interviews.

* This last phase of the boot camp focuses on being employer-ready, improving the skills that students have already learned, and making web applications more performant and efficient. It helps students start to focus on life after boot camp.

* Regex is not covered in the async lessons, but it is the topic of this week's Challenge. Students might struggle with the `05-Regex` activity because it is their first time seeing it, but encourage them to research online and use this activity as practice for the Challenge.

* You will spend some time in this week's second virtual class covering how to create a GitHub gist. Before class, review the [Module 17 Challenge](../../01-Class-Content/17-CS/02-Challenge) and the [GitHub Docs on creating gists](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-gists).

### Common Pain Points

According to our class data, students might experience some of the following pain points throughout the week:

| Pain Point                            | Recommendation                                                                                                                                        |
| ---                                   | ---                                                                                                                                                   |
| Closures                              | Refer to Lesson 2 or the [MDN Web Docs on closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures)                                 |
| Factory functions                     | Refer to Lesson 2 or the resources on how JavaScript works in the Dessert Menu                                                                        |
| Regex                                 | Refer to the Challenge or the [MDN Web Docs on regular expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions)|

## Career Connection

The first virtual class of the week contains a Career Connection section, which links the current module's coursework with career services and students' future careers. During this section, it can be helpful to share examples of how you've used these skills and tools in your professional life.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Coach and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for career services workshops](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp).

If you'd like more information on career services, visit the [career services resources page](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp).

## Module Challenge

For the [Module 17 Challenge](../../01-Class-Content/17-CS/02-Challenge), students will create a technical tutorial that explains regular expression functions. A **regular expression**, or **regex**, is a search pattern used by developers. In the tutorial, students will break down each part of an expression and describe what it does. Writing tutorials is a common task for fledgling developers, and practicing how to think and speak about technologies will prepare students for the interview process.

Students must know how to implement the following skills in order to succeed in this week's Challenge:

* Explain a technical concept in their own words so that a non-technical user can understand it.

* Parse the different components of a search pattern within a technical tutorial.

* Think about the information that a user will need to understand the concept being explained.

* Write about the problem-solving process effectively so that other developers can understand how they solved a problem.

## Heads-Up

* Next week, students will learn about NoSQL databases, specifically MongoDB. They'll use [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/) as their ODM, so be sure to familiarize yourself with both MongoDB and Mongoose before the next class.

* Students will learn how to deploy MongoDB applications to Heroku using MongoDB Atlas in their asynchronous lessons. But for more information, refer them to the [Set Up MongoDB Atlas blog post](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/how-to-set-up-mongodb-atlas) and [Deploy with Heroku and MongoDB Atlas blog post](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/deploy-with-heroku-and-mongodb-atlas) on the Full-Stack Blog at the end of the second virtual class.

* The Module 22 Challenge will be an extra credit opportunity for students. This change comes from student and instructor feedback on the amount of work and time required to complete both the Module 22 Challenge and Project 03 that week. Please let students know about this ahead of time as they enter Phase 3 of the boot camp.
