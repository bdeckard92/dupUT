# Module 17 Instructor Overview: Computer Science for JavaScript

## Overview

In this module, students will prepare for job interviews by learning about the computer science behind JavaScript, including performance measurement, data structures, and algorithms. Students will also practice describing their problem-solving process using pseudocoding.

In this week's virtual classes, you'll go over closures, factory functions, event delegation, and the Fibonacci algorithm. You will also spend a good amount of time in this week's second virtual class going over the Challenge, which will look a bit different from what students are used to seeing. Students will also be introduced to Regex, which is not in the async materials, but is needed for the Challenge.

## Overview of Asynchronous Material 

Why are students learning computer science?

* Computer science fundamentals like performance measurement, data structures, and algorithms are important for interview success.

* Breaking down a coding challenge by using pseudocoding helps prepare students for interviews.

* Big O notation describes the code complexity using mathematical terms and introduces students to measuring efficiency of their code.

* Data structures help students understand how data is stored, organized, and accessed in their code.

* Closures help students better understand scope and functional programming.

* Students will gain experience in object-oriented programming (OOP) design philosophy and be able to contrast it with functional programming.

Throughout the async module this week, students will use Computer Science to do the following:

* Explain and identify the order of common search and sort algorithms.

* Explain how JavaScript works.

* Explain the difference between stacks and queues.

* Explain and implement closures.

* Implement performance-measuring interfaces.

* Explain the historical and contemporary importance of performance in computer science.

**Reminder**: If students need help with an async activity, encourage them to attend Office Hours for help! If you can’t get through all of it, remind them that they can lean on Learning Assistants with the AskBCS bot for more help.

## Virtual Classes

* [Virtual Class 17.1](./17.1-REQUIRED.md)

* [Virtual Class 17.2](./17.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* This week, students will learn computer science fundamentals as they apply to JavaScript. Tell students that this next module will be very different from what they're used to! It is heavier on concepts, but it will help them think like a developer and prepare for interviews. 

* This last phase of the boot camp focuses on being employer-ready, improving the skills that students have already learned, and making web applications more performant and efficient. Basically, students will focus on life after boot camp.

* Regex was not covered in the async lessons, but it is the topic of this week's Challenge. Students might struggle with the `05-Regex` activity because it is their first time seeing it, but encourage them to research online and use this activity as practice for their Challenge.

* You will spend some time in this week's second virtual class covering how to create a GitHub gist. Before class, review the [Module 17 Challenge](../../01-Class-Content/17-CS/02-Challenge) and the [GitHub Docs on creating gists](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-gists).


### Common Pain Points

According to our class data, students might experience some of the following pain points throughout the week:

| Pain Point                            | Recommendation                                                                                                                                        |
| ---                                   | ---                                                                                                                                                   |
| Closures                              | Refer to Lesson 2 or the [MDN Web Docs on closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures)                                 |
| Factory functions                     | Refer to Lesson 2 or the resources on how JavaScript works in the Dessert Menu                                                                        |
| Regex                                 | Refer to the Challenge or the [MDN Web Docs on regular expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions)|

## Career Connection

During each lesson that students work through, they will also view a Career Connection section that will tie together the academic content with career services and how this material will be applicable to them in their future career.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Coach and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp).

If you'd like more information on career services, visit the [career services resources page](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp).

## Module Challenge

For this week's Challenge, students will create a technical tutorial that explains regular expression functions. A **regular expression**, or **regex**, is a search pattern used by developers. In the tutorial, students will break down each part of an expression and describe what it does. Writing tutorials is a common task for fledgling developers, and practicing how to think and speak about technologies will prepare students for the interview process.

[Module 17 Challenge](../../01-Class-Content/17-CS/02-Challenge)

Specific skills students will need to implement in order to be successful:

* Explain a technical concept in their own words so that a non-technical user can understand it.

* Parse the different components of a search pattern within a technical tutorial.

* Think about the information that a user will need to understand the concept being explained.

* Write about the problem-solving process effectively so that other developers can understand how they solved a problem.

## Heads-Up

* Next week, students will learn about NoSQL databases, specifically MongoDB. They'll use [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/) as their ODM, so be sure to familiarize yourself with both MongoDB and Mongoose before the next class. Students will learn how to deploy MongoDB applications to Heroku using MongoDB Atlas in their asynchronous lessons. But for more information, refer them to the supplemental guides on [Setting Up MongoDB Atlas](../../01-Class-Content/18-NoSQL/04-Supplemental/MongoAtlas-Setup.md) and [Deploying with Heroku and MongoDB Atlas](../../01-Class-Content/18-NoSQL/04-Supplemental/MongoAtlas-Deploy.md) at the end of this week's second virtual class.
