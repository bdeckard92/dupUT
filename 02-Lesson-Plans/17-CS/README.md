# Module 17 Instructor Overview: Computer Science for JavaScript

## Overview

In this week's virtual classes, you'll go over closures, factory functions, event delegation, and the Fibonacci algorithm. You will also spend a good amount of time in the Required virtual class going over their Challenge, which looks different from what the students are used to.

## Virtual Classes

[Recommended Class](./17.1-RECOMMENDED.md)

[Required Class](./17.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* This week, students will learn Computer Science fundamentals as they apply to JavaScript. Let the students know that this next module will look very different from what they're used to! It is heavier on concepts, but it will help them think like a developer and prepare them for interviews. 

* This last phase of the boot camp is more about being employer-ready, improving the skills they have already learned, and making their web applications more performant and efficient. Basically, students will focus on "Life after Boot Camp". 

* Regex was not covered in the async lessons, however it is the topic used in this week's Challenge. Students may struggle with the `05-Regex` activity because it is their first time seeing it, but encourage them to research online and use this activity as practice for their Challenge.

* You will spend some time in the Required virtual class going over how to create a GitHub gist, so read over the [Module 17 Challenge](../../01-Class-Content/17-CS/02-Challenge) and familiarize yourself with [creating gists](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-gists) before this class. 

## Career Connection

During each lesson that students work through, they will also view a Career Connection section that will tie together the academic content with Career Services, and how this material will be applicable to them in their future career.

Remind sudents that they should reach out to their Career Director and meet with them often throughout boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also sign up for workshops [here](https://careerservicesonlineevents.splashthat.com/).

## Heads-Up

* Next week, students will learn about noSQL databases, more specifically MongoDB. They will use Mongoose as their ODM, so be sure to familiarize yourself with both before the next class.
