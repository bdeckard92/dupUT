# Module 17 Instructor Overview: Computer Science for JavaScript

## Overview

In this week's virtual classes, you'll go over closures, factory functions, event delegation, and the Fibonacci algorithm. You will also spend a good amount of time in this week's second virtual class going over the Challenge, which will look a bit different from what students are used to seeing.

## Virtual Classes

If your class started **AFTER** January 1, 2021, use these lesson plans:

* [Virtual Class 17.1](./17.1-REQUIRED.md)

* [Virtual Class 17.2](./17.2-REQUIRED.md)

If your class started **BEFORE** January 1, 2021, use these lesson plans:

* [Virtual Class (Recommended) 17.1](./17.1-RECOMMENDED.md)

* [Virtual Class (Required) 17.2](./17.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* This week, students will learn Computer Science fundamentals as they apply to JavaScript. Let the students know that this next module will look very different from what they're used to! It is heavier on concepts, but it will help them think like a developer and prepare them for interviews. 

* This last phase of the boot camp is more about being employer-ready, improving the skills they have already learned, and making their web applications more performant and efficient. Basically, students will focus on "Life after Boot Camp". 

* Regex was not covered in the async lessons, but it is the topic used in this week's Challenge. Students may struggle with the `05-Regex` activity because it is their first time seeing it, but encourage them to research online and use this activity as practice for their Challenge.

* You will spend some time in this week's second virtual class going over how to create a GitHub gist, so read over the [Module 17 Challenge](../../01-Class-Content/17-CS/02-Challenge) and familiarize yourself with [creating gists](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-gists) before this class. 

## Career Connection

During each lesson that students work through, they will also view a Career Connection section that will tie together the academic content with Career Services and how this material will be applicable to them in their future career.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Director and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careerservicesonlineevents.splashthat.com/).

## Heads-Up

* Next week, students will learn about NoSQL databases, and more specifically, MongoDB. They will use Mongoose as their ODM, so be sure to familiarize yourself with both before the next class. Although they will learn how to deploy MongoDB applications to Heroku using MongoDB Atlas in their asynchronous lessons, you should provide them with the supplemental guides on [Setting Up MongoDB Atlas](../../01-Class-Content/18-NoSQL/04-Supplemental/MongoAtlas-Setup.md) and [Deploying with Heroku and MongoDB Atlas](../../01-Class-Content/18-NoSQL/04-Supplemental/MongoAtlas-Deploy.md) at the end of this week's second virtual class.
