# Module 17 Instructor Overview: Computer Science for JavaScript

## Overview

In this module, students will prepare for job interviews by learning about the computer science behind JavaScript, including performance measurement, data structures, and algorithms. Students will also practice describing their problem-solving process using pseudocoding.

In this week's virtual classes, you'll go over closures, factory functions, event delegation, and the Fibonacci algorithm. You will also spend a good amount of time in this week's second virtual class going over the Challenge, which will look a bit different from what students are used to seeing. Students will also be introduced to Regex, which is not in the async materials, but is needed for the Challenge.

| 1    | Event Delegation   | 17.2         |
| 2    | Factory Function   | 17.2         |
| 2    | Fibonacci          | 17.5         |
| 2    | Regex              | Challenge    |

## Overview of Asynchronous Material 

Why are students learning Computer Science?

* Computer science fundamentals -- including performance measurement, data structures and algorithms --  are an important for interview success.

* Breaking down a coding challenge by using pseudocoding helps prepare students for interviews.

* Closures help students better understand scope and functional programming.

* Students will gain experience in object-oriented programming (OOP) design philosophy and be able to contrast it with functional programming.

Throughout the async module this week, students will use Computer Science to do the following:

* Explain and identify the order of common search and sort algorithms

* Explain how JavaScript works

* Explain the difference between stacks and queues

* Explain and implement closures

* Implement performance-measuring interfaces

* Explain the historical and contemporary importance of performance in computer science.

**Reminder:** If students need help with an async activity, encourage them to attend Office Hours for help! If you can’t get through all of it, remind them that they can lean on Learning Assistants with the AskBCS bot for more help.

## Virtual Classes

If your class started AFTER January 1, 2021, use these lesson plans:

* [Virtual Class 17.1](./17.1-REQUIRED.md)

* [Virtual Class 17.2](./17.2-REQUIRED.md)

If your class started BEFORE January 1, 2021, use these lesson plans:

* [Virtual Class (Recommended) 17.1](./17.1-RECOMMENDED.md)

* [Virtual Class (Required) 17.2](./17.2-REQUIRED.md)

## Instructor Notes

* This week, students will learn Computer Science fundamentals as they apply to JavaScript. Let the students know that this next module will look very different from what they're used to! It is heavier on concepts, but it will help them think like a developer and prepare them for interviews. 

* This last phase of the boot camp is more about being employer-ready, improving the skills they have already learned, and making their web applications more performant and efficient. Basically, students will focus on "Life after Boot Camp". 

* Regex was not covered in the async lessons, but it is the topic used in this week's Challenge. Students may struggle with the `05-Regex` activity because it is their first time seeing it, but encourage them to research online and use this activity as practice for their Challenge.

* You will spend some time in this week's second virtual class going over how to create a GitHub gist, so read over the [Module 17 Challenge](../../01-Class-Content/17-CS/02-Challenge) and familiarize yourself with [creating gists](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-gists) before this class. 


### Common Pain Points

According to our class data, students might experience some of the following pain points throughout the week:

| Pain Point                          | Recommendation       |
| ---                                 | ---                  |
| Closures | Refer to Lesson 2 or the [MDN Web Docs on Closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures) |
| Factory Functions | Refer to Lesson 2 or this article [JavaScript Factory Functions vs Constructor Functions vs Classes](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/javascript-factory-functions-vs-constructor-functions-vs-classes-2f22ceddf33e)|
| Regex | Refer to the Challenge, the [MDN Web Docs on Regular Expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions), or the online [RegExr tool](https://regexr.com/)|

## Career Connection

During each lesson that students work through, they will also view a Career Connection section that will tie together the academic content with Career Services and how this material will be applicable to them in their future career.

Remind students that they should reach out to their Career Director and meet with them often throughout the boot camp to help prepare their professional materials. Students can also [sign up for workshops](https://careerservicesonlineevents.splashthat.com/).

If you'd like more information on Career Services, visit the [Career Services resources page](https://mycareerspot.org/).

## Module Challenge

For this week's Challenge, students will create a technical tutorial explaining regular expression functions. A regular expression, or regex, is a search pattern used by developers. In the tutorial, students will break down each part of the expression and describe what it does. Writing tutorials is a common task for fledgling developers, and practicing how students think and speak about technologies will prepare students for the interview process.

[Module 17 Challenge](../../01-Class-Content/17-CS/02-Challenge)

Specific skills students will need to implement in order to be successful:

* Explain a technical concept in their own words so that a non-technical user can understand it.

* Parse the different components of a search pattern within a technical tutorial.

* Think about the information a user will need to understand the concept they are explaining.

* Write about their problem-solving process effectively so that other developers can understand how they solved a problem.

## Heads-Up

Next week, students will learn about NoSQL databases, and more specifically, MongoDB. They will use [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/) as their ODM, so be sure to familiarize yourself with both before the next class. Although they will learn how to deploy MongoDB applications to Heroku using MongoDB Atlas in their asynchronous lessons, you should provide them with the supplemental guides on [Setting Up MongoDB Atlas](../../01-Class-Content/18-NoSQL/04-Supplemental/MongoAtlas-Setup.md) and [Deploying with Heroku and MongoDB Atlas](../../01-Class-Content/18-NoSQL/04-Supplemental/MongoAtlas-Deploy.md) at the end of this week's second virtual class.
