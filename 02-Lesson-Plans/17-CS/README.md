* This week, students will learn Computer Science fundamentals as they apply to JavaScript. Let the students know that this next module will look very different from what they're used to! It is heavier on concepts, but it will help them think like a developer and prepare them for interviews. 

* This last phase of the boot camp is more about being employer-ready, improving the skills they have already learned, and making their web applications more performant and efficient. Basically, students will focus on "Life after Boot Camp".
