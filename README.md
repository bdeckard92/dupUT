# fullstack-online

Welcome to the Coding Online Boot Camp! This repository houses the Coding Online curriculum and is divided into two pillars:

* Student-facing class content

* Instructor-facing lesson plans

## Need Help?

If you find an error or bug in our curriculum, please submit feedback using the [Coding Online Feedback Form for Instructional Teams](https://forms.gle/gbVpzgf6TK4Z2Bf78). The contents of your form submission go directly to our curriculum team.

**Note:** If a bug is related to a virtual class lesson plan in this repository, please create a GitHub issue for faster resolution.

For information about onboarding and training, please consult your Onboarding course in Canvas. If you don't have access or a Canvas account, please email support@bootcampspot.com and provide your name and university.

In case of emergency, message the Full-Stack Online Program Support Manager, Xander Rapstine, in [#05-coding-online](https://trilogyed-instruction.slack.com/archives/CTDADCHD2).

## How to Use This Repository

### Class Content

You will find the following in [01-Class-Content](./01-Class-Content):

* Module instructor overviews

* In-class activities

* Challenge instructions, starter code, and solutions

* Weekly algorithms (where applicable)

* Supplemental content such as installation guides and learning resources

* Module Project code 

  This is the code for the projects that students build in their asynchronous modules in Canvas. You'll find the following in each `05-Module-Project` folder: 

  1. a `main` folder containing the final project build

  2. a `lesson-files` folder containing the snapshots of where the code should be at the end of each lesson in an asynchronous module of content
  
  **Note**: The final project build inside the `main` folder can be provided to your students as early the day after the Required Virtual Class. This will ensure that they have the ability to get through the Module Project prior to finishing up their Weekly Challenge.
  
  You also have the option to give your students a **Lesson Snapshot** (inside the `lesson-files` folder) earlier in the week if they are completely blocked on a lesson of asynchronous content. Please refrain from providing the final project build in the `main` folder to your students until after the Required Virtual Class for that week's module.

Use these materials to build your class repository.

### Lesson Plans

You will find the following in [02-lesson-plans](./02-Lesson-Plans):

* Lesson plans

* Grading rubrics

* Links to slide decks (where applicable)

The `02-Lesson-Plans/README.md` contains tips, alerts, and resources for all modules. 

Each module contains a README.md overview containing tips, alerts, and resources specific to that module. 

üìù The lesson plans in this repo are instructor-facing only and should **not** be shared with students.
