# fullstack-online

Welcome to the Full-Stack Online Coding Bootcamp! This repository houses the Online curriculum and is divided into two pillars:

* student-facing **Class Content**

* instructor-facing **Lesson Plans**. 


## How To Use This Repository

### Class Content

You will find the following in [01-Class-Content](./01-Class-Content):

* Module overviews

* In-class activities

* Challenge instructions, starter code, and solutions

* Weekly algorithms (where applicable)

* Supplemental content such as installation guides and learning resources

Use these materials to build your class repository.

#### Updating Learner-Facing Repository

Each cohort shares a Learner-Facing repository on GitLab (select universities use GitHub). 

##### When to Update

Because each class holds sessions on opposing schedules, everyone should be mindful of when solutions for activities are posted. For a cohort that has classes running on a M/W and T/TH schedule, one instructional staff member from each class should take the responsibility of updating the learner-facing repository as follows: 

* Before video class, push `Unsolved` activities for that module. 

* *After video class, push `Solved` activities for that module. 


##### How to Update

Use regular git workflow to update the class repository. Ensure that you have pulled the latest updates from the `master` branch of this repo. 

1. `git pull` the `master` branch of your learner-facing repository to ensure you have all changes another instructional staff member may have made. 
2. Add the files/folders that need to be added. 
3. `git add .` to stage your additions. 
4. `git commit -m "Adds x, y, z"` to commit your changes with an appropriate message. 
5. `git push origin master` to push to the `master` branch. (Note: You may use feature branching if you would prefer.)
6. Verify that your updates went through by accessing the repo GUI. 


### Lesson Plans

In addition to lesson plans, you will find the following in [02-lesson-plans](./02-lesson-plans):

* Grading rubrics

* Links to slide decks (where applicable)

`02-Lesson-Plans/README.md` contains tips, alerts, and resoures for all modules. 

Each module contains a README.md overview containing tips, alerts, and resources specific to that module. 

üìù These materials are _not_ to be shared with students.

## FAQs

### What's the Difference between a Class and a Cohort?

A Class is defined as one group of learners led by one Instructor and supported by assigned Instructional Staff Members. Classes are held on either a Monday/Wednesday or Tuesday/Thursday schedule on video calls where they meet for direct instruction. Learners from one class cannot attend scheduled class time for a different class. Your Program Support Manager can clarify to which class any Instructional Staff or learners are assigned.

A Cohort is a group of 2 or more classes that begin during the same week. A cohort shares a Slack workspace to increase the networking ability of learners, the availability of Instructional Staff to support each other, and the overall community feeling of the program.

Office Hours, which are held outside of standard class times throughout the week by Teaching Assistants, are available for learners from all classes in the cohort.


### How do you I use Slack with my classes and cohorts?

Please see this learner-facing [Slack Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lpdyle9Q538uduFUHPD6NVlfQj5vCEGBQwlKMr3QzDY/edit?usp=sharing) example document for details on how your learners can use the Slack Workspace. 


#### TL;DR

* Your Slack Workspace is shared across a cohort, meaning it will typically be shared with another class. 
* When posting class-specific material, use your `#01-live-[day]` channel so only your class sees it.
* When posting cohort-specific material, please use `#general` so all learners see it.
* Centralized team of Learning Assistants can tackle learner questions in the `#04-learning-assistant` channel. 
* Instructional Staff should **NOT** be messaged directly for assistance; please ask students to use the Learning Assistants or direct them to your Office Hours. 


### What's the Difference between GitHub and GitLab?
As you may have noticed, we use a couple of different systems to deliver information to both our Instructional Staff and our learners. Let's go through what they are and what the differences are!

Our Instructional Staff facing repository lives on GitHub. It's where we house all the lesson plans and activities for the Virtual Class (Recommended/Required) sessions held on video calls.

Learner-Facing GitLab Repository

NOTE: Rutgers, UCF, and UT Austin use GitHub instead of GitLab for their learner-facing repositories.

Each cohort will have its own learner-facing repository on GitLab that will be where you can share the unsolved and solved versions of your in-class activities. Be mindful of when you update things because each repo is shared across a cohort that completes classes on different days.

If you have questions about how to update your learner-facing repository, be sure to check out the guide on Updating Learner-Facing Repo


### What are the Instructional & Support Roles?

We value everything you do for our program and our learners, and we know it would not be possible without the help of various teams. Here's a quick run-down of who you may see throughout your program. 

#### Instructor
* Lead facilitator of learning experience
* Manage Virtual Class sessions and office hours before and after classes
* Guide the supporting Instructional Staff team
* Monitor student progress

#### Instructional Staff
* Support Instructor during Virtual Class sessions
* Troubleshoot and support students during Virtual Class sessions
* Provide critical feedback and evaluations
* Independently lead supplementary Office Hours throughout the week

#### Learning Assistants
* Centralized virtual team available on Slack for learners
* Engage via centralized Slackbot
* Claim learner questions one-at-a-time
* Lead students to find their own solutions in alignment with core learning
* Quick, streamlined curriculum support for learners

#### Centralized Graders
*Coming soon!* 

* Grade Challenge Assignments for class
* Provide commentary to help Instructional Staff track learner progress

#### Program Support Manager
* Oversee learner experience from orientation to graduation 
* Provide logistical program information
* Direct line for contact needs
* Personalized program support to help learners reach goals

#### Online Instructional Lead

* Personalized coaching plan for your continued comfort in the classroom 
* Help schedule substitutes as needed


### What if I need a substitute?

If you need a substitute for your Instructional Staff role, whether it be leading a Virtual Class or hosting supplementary Office Hours, please contact your Online Instructional Lead.

If you do not know who your Online Instructional Lead is, please feel free to contact your Online Instructional Lead or post in your private instructional channel on your cohort's Slack workspace for information.


### What if I have questions for payroll or HR?

If you have any Payroll or Human Resources related questions, please be sure to write an email to support@bootcampspot.com.

Be sure to include:

Your Name
Your Cohort or Class Code
The issue you are having and any supporting documentation


### What if Learners are in the Wrong Class?

If your have a learner in the wrong Virtual Class group, please contact your Program Support Manager immediately. They can handle the communication on this matter.

Because the Slack workspace is shared across a cohort, learners may sometimes be curious about attending the other class sessions. However, this is not something that the program allows. Please be sure that only the learners assigned to your class are in attendance for your scheduled Virtual Class sessions.

Please note that Supplementary Office Hours led by a single Instructional Staff Member throughout the week for 2 hour periods are available to all learners across the cohort.
