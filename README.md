## How to Use This Repository

### Class Content

You will find the following in [01-Class-Content](./01-Class-Content):

* Module instructor overviews

* In-class activities

* Challenge instructions, starter code, and solutions

* Weekly algorithms (where applicable)

* Supplemental content such as installation guides and learning resources

* Module Project code 

  This is the code for the projects that students build in their asynchronous modules in Canvas. You'll find the following in each `05-Module-Project` folder: 

  1. a `main` folder containing the final project build

  2. a `lesson-files` folder containing the snapshots of where the code should be at the end of each lesson in an asynchronous module of content

Use these materials to build your class repository.

### Lesson Plans

You will find the following in [02-lesson-plans](./02-Lesson-Plans):

* Lesson plans

* Grading rubrics

* Links to slide decks (where applicable)

The `02-Lesson-Plans/README.md` contains tips, alerts, and resources for all modules. 

Each module contains a README.md overview containing tips, alerts, and resources specific to that module. 

üìù The lesson plans in this repo are instructor-facing only and should **not** be shared with students.
